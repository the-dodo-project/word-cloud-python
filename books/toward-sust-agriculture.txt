Preface to “Toward a Sustainable
Agriculture: Farming Practices and
Water Use”
Globally, the agri-food sector has a major role to play in ensuring food
security and economic development, especially for lower income countries. It is
responsible for producing food that is nutritious and affordable to a growing
world population, and for generating income and employment for a large number
of people involved along the agri-food chain. As such, the contribution of the agrifood
sector extends the mere production of the primary food products at farm
level to also include the food processing industry, wholesale and retail. The
success with which the agri food sector can meet these responsibilities is very
much dependent on the ability of primary producers, at farm level, to supply
primary food products that meet the stringent requirements in terms of quantity
and quality. Without sufficient supply, the other role-players along the value
chain will not be able to meet the demand of consumers. It is also at farm level,
where the producers face a variety of risks that negatively affect their ability to
produce products that meet the requirements. Environmental risk, exacerbated by
climate change, is a major type of risk that negatively affects the ability of primary
producers to produce products that meet the above requirements. Changes in the
distribution and intensity of rainfall have a major impact on agricultural
production, as is well-documented. Agricultural producers have to adapt to find
new ways to mitigate the impact of climate change and associated risks on their
farming enterprises. Agricultural production is also well documented to
contribute significantly to environmental degradation. A new generation of more
informed consumers is putting more pressure on retail stores to ensure that the
products they buy are produced sustainably. As such, requirements regarding
sustainable practices are being specified to all role-players along the value chain,
including agricultural producers. Compliance with sustainable production
practices is becoming ever more important for being allowed to sell food products,
especially in high value markets. Costs associated with compliance place pressure
on the budgets of agricultural producers, depressing profit margins. Thin profit
margins, often associated with primary agricultural production, mean that
producers are not necessarily compensated sufficiently for the risks they have to
bare. Ultimately, the farming enterprise still needs to make financial sense for the
producer to remain in business. Failing to make ends meet, from a financial
perspective, is a major cause for farmers leaving the sector for alternative careers.
As such, the ability of the agri-food sector to meets its responsibility in ensuring
X
global food security, and contributing to social and economic development, is
increasingly difficult. It is within this context that agricultural producers have to
operate, meeting the demand of the agri-food sector to feed growing populations
in a sustainable manner while still trying to make ends meet. Agricultural
producers are in need of science-based evidence to inform them how to overcome
the above challenges. Through this book, a variety of scholars explore risks and
potential solutions to inform producers and policy makers regarding practices
towards sustainable production, and regarding the sustainable use of freshwater
in agricultural production in a context of a changing climate.

Maximizing Rainfall in Lowland Paddy Rice
throughWater Depths Control and Alternate
Wetting and Drying Irrigation Technique in
Southern Taiwan
Victoriano Joseph Pascual and Yu-MinWang
Abstract: Rainfall along with the use of alternate wetting and drying irrigation
technique is proposed to minimize water use and optimize crop yield and water
productivity in paddy rice cultivation. A field experiment was conducted to
determine the most suitable ponded water depth for reducing paddy rice irrigation.
Water treatments of T2cm, T3cm, T4cm, and T5cm were applied weekly from
transplanting to early heading through a complete randomized block design with
four replications. The results showed that yield loss in T2cm was 3.5 times more
than that of T3cm and 14 times more than T4cm. The highest irrigation water
productivity and total water productivity was produced in T2cm, whereas rainwater
productivity was greater in T5cm. The weekly application of T4cm ponded water
depth along with rainfall matched the required crop water and produced the lowest
yield reduction and grain production loss, in addition to 20% water saving. Water
stress at panicle initiation decreased the daily headed panicle per square meter
by 155%, 214%, and 443% in T4cm, T3cm, and T2cm compared to T5cm. However, the
decrease of this parameter was followed by total recovery caused by the effective
rainfall contribution.
1. Introduction
Global agriculture in the 21st century faces the tremendous challenge of
providing enough food for a growing population under increasing scarcity of water
resources, while minimizing environmental consequences [1,2]. Fresh water for
irrigation is becoming increasingly scarce because of population growth, increasing
urban and industrial development, and the decreasing availability resulting from
pollution and resource depletion [1,3]. The world food security remains largely
dependent on irrigated lowland rice which is the main source of rice supply [4].
It provides 75% of the total rice production [1], and consumes more than 50% of
total fresh water. By 2025, it is predicted that 15–20 million hectares of irrigated
rice field may suffer from physical water scarcity, and the world’s farmers should
be producing about 60% more rice than at present to meet the food demand of the
expected world population [5]. The challenge for sustainable rice production is
to decrease the amount of water while maintaining or increasing grain yields [6].
1
Since the foreseen increase in the supply of rice is constrained by lack of sufficient
available water, the most appropriate solution for worldwide water shortage is to
make efficient use of agricultural water [7]. China has pioneered various water-saving
irrigation technologies to achieve more water-efficient irrigation for agricultural
systems [8,9]. Among the various water saving methods, the most widely promoted
one for rice is alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation [10,11]. It is reported that
AWD practices could reduce both water use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
without seriously sacrificing grain yield in rice systems [2]. In AWD, irrigation
water is applied to achieve intermittent flooded and non-flooded soil conditions.
The frequency of irrigation and duration of non-flooding can be determined by
re-irrigating (to achieve flooded conditions) after a fixed number of non-flooded days,
when a certain threshold of soil water potential is reached, when the ponded water
table level drops to a certain level below the soil surface, when cracks appear on the
soil surface, or when plants show visual symptoms of water shortage [8]. Commonly,
irrigation is applied to obtain 2–5 cm ponded water depth after a certain number
of days (ranging from two to seven) have passed following the disappearance of
ponded water [5]. Yield penalty was commonly observed under AWD compared with
continuously flooded (CF)-irrigated rice [12]. Generally, however, AWD increased
water productivity with respect to total water input because the yield reduction was
smaller than the amount of water saved [13]. Tuong et al. [5] assessed the efficiency
of AWD compared with CF and found that AWD yielded better than CF in terms of
water savings and farm profitability. However, rice is very sensitive to water stress
and attempts to reduce water may result in yield reduction and threaten food security.
Therefore, efficient irrigation water use requires effective water management during
the entirety of the crop production cycle.
Rice is also a very important and valuable crop in Taiwan with a total yield of
more than 1.73 million tonnes from 271,077 hectares of land for a production value of
TND (Taiwan New Dollar) 41.48 billion (about USD 1.37 billion) in 2014 [14]. There
are two cropping seasons for paddy rice in Taiwan. The first crop is cultivated in
February and harvested in July, and the second crop is cultivated in August and
harvested in December [15]. Taiwan is located in a rainy region with 78% of the
rainfall occurring from May to October, with possibilities of rainfall reaching up to
90% in the southern region. Taiwan has an annual average precipitation of 2500
mm, which is higher than the world’s average of 834 mm; however, there is still
grave water demand, and fresh water for irrigation limits rice production. Apart
from rapid urbanization, industrialization, and high irrigation water consumption
from the agriculture sector (80%), only a small portion of the water brought by
precipitation can be stored over land, as most of the water flows directly into the sea
through various rivers in response to steep mountain terrain [16,17], furthermore, this
situation is exacerbated by climate change. In 2014, rice production was compromised
2
as a consequence of extended drought forcing the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) to implement water rationing measures by fallowing approximately 5% of
Taiwan’s cultivated land [14].
Agriculture water resource scarcity directly affects crop productivity and
aggravates food deficit problems for millions of people [18]. In this regard, the
maximization of water resources is imperative and the combined effects of rainfall
and irrigation management should be addressed together regarding the environment
specificities for maximizing water use efficiency and yield per unit of irrigation
water applied. Thus, AWD can be optimized and may reduce irrigation cost,
increase output, and can particularly be effective in the reproductive and grain filling
stages, where rice is more sensitive to water stress. Therefore, the objectives of this
research are to apply AWD irrigation to determine the most effective ponded water
depth leading to optimum water uptake and low yield losses, while simultaneously
maximizing rainfall use alongside scheduled irrigation, and to determine the
morphological changes in paddy rice caused by the ponded water treatments. It
is expected that the AWD technique can be optimized, through strategic irrigation
management while taking full advantage of rainfall occurrences. Such an approach
is less documented in areas such as southern Taiwan, hence the reason for the current
field experiment.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Experimental Site and Trial Design
The experiment was conducted from February to June 2015 in the irrigation
experimental field of National Pingtung University of Science and Technology in
southern Taiwan, located at 22.39◦ (N) latitude and 34.95◦ (E) longitude and 71 m
above sea level. The soil type was loamy (27% of sand and 24% of clay) with a wilting
point of 15% volume, field capacity 30.5% volume, saturation 42.9% volume, bulk
density 1.40 g/cm3, matric potential 11.09 bar, and hydraulic conductivity 57 mm/hr.
The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with four
replications and four water treatments. Each plot was 6 m long, 1 m wide, with a
total area of 6 m2, and 0.3 m soil bed height. The spacing between plots and between
blocks was 1 m. Ponded water depths were kept constant at 5 cm, 4 cm, 3 cm,
and 2 cm representing T5cm, T4cm, T3cm, and T2cm.
2.2. Crop Management and Irrigation Management
Twenty-five day old seedlings were obtained from a seed nursery and were
manually transplanted on 1 February 2015. Three seedlings were transplanted at
hill spacing 25 cm between hills and 20 cm between rows (20 plants m2). Fertilizer
(N:P2O5:K2O) was applied at a ratio of 12:18:12 with a rate of 170 kg/ha at basal,
3
mid tillering, and panicle initiation. Pests were controlled by pesticide application
and weeds by frequent manual weeding. Irrigation treatments were applied
immediately after transplanting and the irrigation interval was scheduled at seven
days. Equation (1) was used to obtain the desired water volume at required depth
considering seepage and infiltration in the experimental design and results.
IR = A × h × 103 (1)
where IR is the amount of irrigation water (L) for a desired depth above the soil
surface, A is the surface area of the plot (m2), and h is the desired ponded water
depth above the soil surface (m). The final irrigation treatment was applied during
heading stage on 15 May 2015. Thereafter, the rain was frequent and the crop was
subjected to rainy conditions.
2.3. Soil Water Content and Soil Trend Analysis
The soil water content was monitored every two days from one month after
transplanting to three weeks before harvest using the gravimetric method. Soil
samples were collected using an auger in three different locations within each plot
at 25 cm depth. The soil was immediately weighed, and dry weight was obtained
after oven drying at 105◦ C for 24 h. The soil water content per unit was calculated
using the following Equation (4).
SW =
100 × ( f resh weight − dry weight)
dry weight
× γs (2)
where SW is the soil water content and γs is the soil bulk density (g/cm3). The soil
water trend was analyzed by determining the soil water content at saturation level,
field capacity, wilting point, and stress threshold using Equations (3)–(6) [19].
SWSat = 1000 (Sat) × Zr (3)
SWFC = 1000 (FC) × Zr (4)
SWWP = 1000 (WP) × Zr (5)
SWST = 1000 (1 − P)Sat × Zr (6)
where SWSat, SWFC, SWWP, and SWST are soil water content (mm) at saturation,
field capacity, wilting point, and stress threshold level, respectively. Sat, FC, and
WP are the soil at saturation, field capacity, and wilting point, respectively, in
percentage of volume. P is the fraction of water that can be depleted before
moisture stress occurs and represents 20% of the saturation for rice crop; Zr is
the sample collection depth (m).

2.4. Assessment of Agronomic Parameters
A square meter quadrant which constitutes 20 individual hills was established
in the center of each plot to assess plant height and tiller number at panicle initiation
and heading stage. Plant height was measured from the base to the tip of the
highest leaf while tillers were counted individually per plant. Five hills from each
replicate were randomly selected outside the squares for root and biomass per hill
assessment at panicle initiation. This was done using an auger 10 cm diameter
to remove soil of 20 cm depth from selected hills [20]. A uniform soil volume
of 1570 cm3 was excavated to collect root samples for all treatments. Roots were
carefully washed and removed from uprooted plants. Root volume was measured by
the water displacement method of putting all the roots in a measuring cylinder and
getting the displaced water volume [21]. Root depth was obtained by direct manual
measurements of the top root using a ruler against a millimeter paper. Roots dry
weight and dry biomass per hill were obtained after oven drying at 70 ◦C for 24 h.
2.5. Leaf Chlorophyll Content and Relative Water Content
A chlorophyll meter (model SPAD-502, MINOLTA, Osaka, Japan) was used to
determine leaf chlorophyll content. Good correlations have been found between
the SPAD-502 value and extractable leaves chlorophyll content in several species,
although specific calibration is always recommended [22,23]. At panicle initiation
and heading stage, 12 hills per plot were selected throughout the diagonals and
median, and the 12 uppermost fully expanded leaves were selected from these
random hills to analyze the variability of chlorophyll content among treatments with
three observations made per leaf. Analysis of leaves sampling patterns done by
Chapman and Bareto [24] showed that at least four leaves per plot are needed, with
several observations per leaf. Then, the average of these three readings was used to
represent the leaf chlorophyll content.
The leaf relative water content (RWC) was calculated from fresh weight (FW),
dry weight (DW), and turgid weight (TW) [25].
RWC (%) = [(FW −DW)/(TW −DW)] × 100 (7)
2.6. Measuring of Yield and Yield Components
To analyze the heading rate, daily headed panicle numbers was determined
in each plot from the appearance of the first panicle until 50% of the farm headed.
At harvest, yield components (panicle number per hill, panicle length, and panicle
weight, grain number per panicle, grain weight per panicle, and filled grain per
panicle) were obtained from inside the square [4]. Panicles were cut at the base,
separated from the straw, and the number was determined for each hill. Panicles
from each plot were individually measured to determine maximum and minimum
5
length. The range was calculated, and the class interval was obtained by dividing the
range by 3 (desired number of classes). Three length classes were determined per plot
and panicles were arranged accordingly. Five panicles were randomly picked from
each class and the length and weight were measured. The same sampled panicles
were individually hand threshed and grain number per panicle was determined.
All plants in the squares were harvested, excluding those in edges, for grain yield
per unit of area (tha−1) determination. Three samples of harvested grains were
randomly picked from each replicate and the dry weight was determined. Grain
weight per panicle, and grain yield for unit area was obtained at a constant weight
after oven drying at 70 ◦C for 72 h. The grain yield for unit area was then adjusted
at the standard moisture content of 14%. Five samples of 1000 grains were taken
from the total grain production of each plot and weighed for the 1000 grain weight
determination. Filled spikelets from these samples were separated from unfilled
spikelets using a seed blower for 2 mm. The percentage of filled grain was calculated,
using mass as the basis, as the ratio of filled grain weight out of the total grain weight
multiplied by 100. Fifteen samples were considered per treatment. The dry biomass
per hill from the harvested plants was determined after oven drying at 70 ◦C for 24 h,
and the total straw weight (tha−1) was calculated accordingly. The harvest index (HI)
was calculated as the ratio of total grain yield out of the total straw yield.
2.7. Water Productivity Assessment
The total water productivity (TWP), irrigation water productivity (IWP) and
rain water productivity (RWP) were calculated according to Equations (8)–(10) [26]:
TWP =
Y
TWU
(8)
IWP =
Y
IWU
(9)
RWP =
Y
RWU
(10)
where TWP, IWP, and RWP are the total water (rain + irrigation), irrigation water,
and rain water productivity, respectively, expressed in kg·m−3; Y is the grain yield
(kg·ha−1), TWU, IWU, and RWU are the total water, irrigation water, and rain water
used, respectively, expressed in m3·ha−1.
Grain production losses were calculated considering the yield in the highest
water treatment (T5cm) as a reference, and water saving impact was defined as the
grain production lost by saving one unit of irrigation water. The water saving impact
was obtained by dividing the quantity of grain lost per hectare by the amount of
water saved (m3/ha).

2.8. Data Analysis
The statistical analysis applied on the data includes correlation, and the
analysis of variance was done using SPSS 18 software (PASW Statistics for Windows,
version 18.0.; SPSS Inc.: Chicago, IL, USA, 2009). The significance of the treatment
effect was determined using F-test and means were separated through Turkey’s test
at a 0.05 significance level.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Agro-Hydrological Conditions during the Growing Season
The daily maximum temperatures, minimum temperatures, daily rain fall, and
crop evapotranspiration (ETc) during the crop production cycle are presented in
Figure 1. The weather data were recorded at the National Pingtung University of
Science and Technology Agro-Meteorological station. Maximum and minimum
temperatures (see Figure 1a) varied from 16.4 to 31.1 ◦C with a mean value of 25.1 ◦C,
and from 14.1 to 28.8 ◦C with a mean value of 23.5 ◦C, respectively. The low values
for these two parameters were observed in February while the high values were
observed in June. February was recorded as the driest month during the crop cycle.
Daily rainfall (see Figure 1b) ranged from 0 to 81.3 mm with monthly recorded
values (February, March, April, May, and June 2015) of 5.2, 0.9, 11.2, 229.2, and 30.1
mm, respectively. Rainfall was more frequent during the month of May compared to
other months and coincided with the final stages of panicle initiation and throughout
heading. The ETc was obtained by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration
(ETo) per adjusted crop coefficient (Kc) [14]. Crop evapotranspiration varied along
the production cycle and ranged from 1.33 to 3.12 mm/day with the lowest observed
value in February (vegetative stage) and the highest value observed in April (panicle
initiation). From panicle initiation up to the onset of harvest the crop water demand
was above 2 mm/day.

According to the growth stages, 62 m3/ha of rain was recorded
during the vegetative growth stage (February–March), 509 m3/ha during
panicle initiation (April–12 May 2015), and 2197 m3/ha from heading (12
May 2015) to harvest (16 June 2015). During the vegetative stage rainfall
represented 3.87%, 2.58% 1.93%, and 1.55% of irrigation water applied in treatments
T2cm, T3cm, T4cm, and T5cm, respectively. From panicle initiation to heading, it
represented 42.41%, 28.27%, 21.21%, and 16.96% of the same treatments. Plants were
8
almost entirely grown under irrigation at the vegetative stage; on the contrary, they
were subjected to both irrigation and rainfall during panicle initiation and almost
exclusively grown under rain-fed condition from heading to harvest. The highest
rainfall contribution throughout the crop production cycle occurred from heading
to harvest.
3.2. Soil Water Content of Different Water Treatments
The soil water trend analysis was based on the soil stress threshold and was
recorded from the vegetative to heading stage during the crop production cycle
(see Figure 2). Throughout the vegetative stage, the soil water content reached its
maximum every two days after irrigation and then a sharp decline occurred until the
next irrigation. The highest water treatment (T5cm) produced the highest soil water
content throughout the crop production cycle. Soil water content varied according to
irrigation treatments, but was usually between soil stress thresholds and/or above
soil saturation level for all water treatments during the vegetative stage. The soil
water content for T2cm produced the lowest values throughout the growing cycle,
but was never below the soil stress threshold during the vegetative stage, whereas
that of T4cm and T3cm was frequently between highest and lowest water treatments
at this time. At panicle initiation, the soil water content for T2cm fell below the soil
stress threshold level six times, with 79.4 mm recorded as the lowest value. Soil water
content for T3cm fell below the soil stress threshold level once (84.8 mm), however,
low values of 87.3, 86.3, and 87.5mmwere also recorded. From 18 May 2015 onwards,
rainfall was frequent and irrigation was suspended. The soil water content at this
time was closer to saturation levels in all treatments. Previous studies [27,28] have
confirmed that the critical stages for rice sensitivity to water stress are during panicle
initiation, anthesis, and grain filling. Boonjung and Fukai [29] highlighted that
plants which suffer mild stress during early panicle development stage suffered yield
reduction of around 30% due to reduction in the number of spikelets per panicle.
Water stress was observed during the high crop water requirement period (panicle
initiation), with T2cm being significantly affected compared to the other treatments.

3.3. Crop Growth
Growth parameters of plant height and tiller numbers presented in Table 1 show
that plant height was significantly affected by water treatments at panicle initiation
and heading stage. Under water stress, plants reduced evapotranspiration which led
to decreases in photosynthesis which in turn induced the decrease of chlorophyll,
height, and tiller number [13]. Reddy et al. [30] concluded that drought stress induced
a decline in net photosynthesis and reduced growth rate. Low plant heights were
notable in lower water treatments, with T2cm and T3cm showing significant height
differences compared to T5cm at the panicle initiation. At heading, the lowest plant
height was recorded in T2cm, while comparable height was seen among T5cm, T4cm,
and T3cm. Water stress in T3cm was not as severe as that of T2cm, hence the reason
T3cm was able to produce comparable height to T5cm at heading. Water restrictions
at panicle initiation decreased average plant height by 8.35%, 4.21%, and 2.50%,
while at heading height was reduced by 4%, 2.9%, and 2.2% in T2cm, T3cm, and
T4cm, respectively. A high correlation (R2 = 0.92 and R2 = 0.93, respectively) was
found between plant height and irrigation water application during panicle initiation
and heading (see Figure 3a,b). It is well known that water restriction may retard
plant growth and reduce plant height, however, plants subjected to slight water
stress conditions during the panicle initiation stage recovered faster under well water
conditions. Lilley and Fukai [31] demonstrated that severe water deficit suspended
apical development until re-watering occurred, while mild water deficit reduced the
10
rate of apical development. Kima et al. [32] confirmed that plants recovered from
the effects of water stress that occurred during vegetative stage and performed as
well as the highest water treatment at heading stage. The extent of recovery due to
re-watering strongly depends on pre-drought intensity and duration [33].
No significant differences were observed for tiller numbers among water
treatments, however, the smallest tillers and the lowest tiller numbers were observed
in T2cm. Nguyen et al. [34], in comparing various water saving systems in rice, found
no significant difference in tiller number among water treatments and suggested that
tillering was less sensitive than other characteristics, such as plant height and leaf
area. Akram et al. [35] also noted that in all growth stages, tiller number per hill of
different rice cultivars was not significantly affected by soil moisture stress. Results
show correlation (R2 = 0.78) at panicle initiation and (R2 = 0.82) at heading, thereby
revealing significant correlations between irrigation water and tiller number (see
Figure 3c,d).

3.4. Dry Biomass, Root Dry Weight, Root Depth, and Root Volume
The results of root parameters and dry biomass are presented in Table 2. The
highest values for dry biomass, root volume, and root dry weight was produced
in T5cm. No significant differences were observed between dry biomass and root
volume for T3cm and T4cm, however, significant differences were observed between
13
T5cm and T2cm. Blackwell et al. and Turner et al. [36,37] observed that biomass
production decreases with decreasing water availability. In addition, dry biomass
accumulation is one of the main growth factors of rice and large root dry weight
matter as high root activity implies strong water and nutrient absorption capacity,
which tend to favor high grain production [38,39]. Lilley and Fukai [31] explained
that rice cultivars differ in physiological response to water deficit that is associated
with differences in water extraction capability. Furthermore, the response of different
plants to water stress is much more complex, and various mechanisms are adopted
by plants when they encounter drought stress at various growth stages [40]. The
results also indicate that no significant differences were observed for root depths
for all treatment. Ascha et al. [41] highlighted that plants become adapted to water
deficiency through the possession of a pronounced root system, which maximizes
water capture and allows access to water depth. Kima et al. [32] evaluated various
water treatments for water use efficiency under saturated soil culture and noted that
lower root depth and root weight values were produced in higher water treatments.
They concluded that such results may be explained by the effects of hydraulic head
pressure, which may affect infiltration rate. Further explanation revealed that, in
higher water treatments, water depth on the soil surface may lead to an infiltration
rate that matches in time with water uptake, and hence the availability of soil water
may not reach a critical point for the crop to develop a deeper root system as an
adaptation measure [32]. Root dry weight and root volume were significantly higher
for T5cm when compared to T2cm, but no significant differences were found among
T2cm, T3cm, and T4cm. Further observation showed that roots were thicker and fuller
in 0–10 cm soil in T5cm when compared to the other water treatments. In addition,
healthy roots were observed in all treatments. Root health may be attributed to
repeated wetting and drying practiced under AWD. Ndiiri et al. [16] explained that
of the several factors that contribute to high nitrogen availability and high nitrogen
usage efficiency under system of rice intensification (SRI) management practices, the
repeated wetting and drying process may have the greatest influence; moreover, lack
of aeration of soil affects not only root health and functions, but also the populations
of beneficial organisms that contribute to plant nutrition and health. There is also
evidence that phosphorus solubilization and availability are increased by alternate
wetting and drying [32].

3.5. Leaf Chlorophyll Content and Relative Water Content
The effect of water treatments on leaf chlorophyll content and leaf relative water
content (RWC) at panicle initiation is presented in Table 3. It is well established that
AWD exposes crops to temporary water stress during the drying cycles and that
plants adapt to water stress by stomatal closure, change in leaf turgor, and chlorophyll
fluorescence. Leaf greenness is an indicator of a plant’s health, and it may be affected
by both leaf nitrogen content and water stress [4]. Chlorophyll content and RWC
was highest in (T5cm), with no significant differences observed among the other
treatments. Cha-Um et al. [42] explained that, in evaluating water deficit stress in
four indica rice genotypes, RWC in the flag leaf was positively correlated with total
chlorophyll; moreover, total chlorophyll and total carotenoids in all rice cultivars
were drastically degraded when subjected to severe water stress. However, the
degradation percentage of the pigments would recover and greatly improve after
re-watering. It was also noted that water use efficiency in rice subjected to water
deficit declined significantly. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [43] highlighted that under an
alternate wetting and severe soil drying regime (WSD), cytokinin levels were reduced
when compared to conventional irrigation and alternate wetting and moderate soil
drying (WMS). The explanation in support stated that changes in hormones in leaves
under different treatments were closely associated with those of the photosynthetic
rate, with a high correlation observed between hormone content and photosynthetic
rate. There was no significant difference in chlorophyll content and RWC at the
heading stage. RWC value was higher during the heading stage compared with the
panicle initiation stage, since at this time the soil water content was usually higher
due to frequent rain fall. Akram et al. [35] and Lafitte [44] explained that reduction of
leaf RWC was related to soil water content, especially in water deficit stress cultivars.

3.6. Effect of Water Treatment on Yield Components and Grain Yield
Daily headed panicle and panicle emergence were affected by water treatments
(see Figure 4). Panicle numbers in T5cm were significantly higher, and emergence
was faster compared with other treatments. When compared to T5cm, panicle
reduction rate per square meter was 155%, 214%, and 443% in, T4cm, T3cm, and
T2cm, respectively. The high occurrences of water stress in T2cm at panicle initiation
caused significant declines in headed panicle per m2, showing that water restriction
affected the number of reproductive tillers. By delaying plant growth, water stress
during panicle initiation delayed the heading rate, which decreased the panicle
number per hill. Akram et al. [30] explained that severe soil moisture stress at
panicle initiation was more destructive to panicle number per hill, panicle length,
panicle dry weight, shoot dry weight, and total grains per panicle, irrespective of
the cultivars, resulting in a drastic decrease in per hectare paddy yield. O’Toole
and Moya [45] highlighted that water deficit at any growth stage may reduce such
conditions based on the magnitude of the reduction which is dependent on the
severity, timing, and duration.

Figure 4. Effects of water treatments on daily headed panicle.
The results presented in Table 4 show that no significant differences were
produced for average panicle number per hill, average panicle length, and average
panicle weight; however, average panicle weight decreased with the lowest water
treatment. Davatgar et al. [46] explained that mild water stress at mid tillering
affects assimilates translocation from most plant parts to the panicles, via altering
source sink relationships. The reduction in leaf cell expansion decreased the sink
strength for vegetative growth and lessened the competition with panicle growth
assimilates. Even though water stress occurred during the panicle initiation stage,
it is well established that tillering and panicle initiation may occur simultaneously,
and probably contributed to the translocation of assimilates during this time. The
effect of assimilates being translocated from plant parts may be one of the reasons for
the yielding of comparative results. From heading to harvest, a total of 2768 m3/ha
of rainfall was registered which may have also contributed towards overcoming
the effects of water stress which occurred during early panicle initiation in some
treatments. Kima et al. [4] explained that high rainfall occurring from heading to
harvest allowed crops to overcome the effects of water stress experienced during
vegetative stage, leading to recovery of yield components such as panicle number
and grain number per panicle. Turner et al. [37] also suggested that the reduction
of yield component by water stress is dependent on severity, timing, and duration;
furthermore, previously established literature [33] has indicted that the response of
17
different plants to water stress is much more complex and that various mechanism
are adopted by plants when they encounter drought stress at various growth stages.

The values in Table 5 show that water treatments significantly affected the
average grain number per panicle, grain weight per panicle, grain filling rate,
and 1000 grain weight. The lowest values of these parameters were observed in T2cm.
There were no significant differences observed for average grain number per panicle
between T5cm and T2cm, however, water stress significantly affected grain weight per
panicle in T2cm and grain filling rate in T2cm and T3cm. Grain weight per panicle was
reduced by 32% in T2cm, while unfilled grain percentage was 18.7%, 20.9%, 25.1%,
and 31.1% for T5cm, T4cm, T3cm, and T2cm, respectively. For 1000 grain weight, 17.5%
of the weight was lost in T2cm. Since there was a delay in heading, and panicle
initiation occurred at the same time with flowering, water stress greatly affected
the flowering stage. This might be because water stress slowed down carbohydrate
synthesis and/or weakened the sink strength at reproductive stages and aborted
fertilized ovaries [47]. As a result, this may have induced spikelet sterility or grain
filling delay, leading to high unfilled grain percentage in T2cm.

The results of straw weight, grain yield, and harvest index in Table 6 show
that these parameters were affected by water treatments. Grain yield in T2cm was
significantly reduced by water stress which occurred during panicle initiation. Even
though water stress occurred simultaneously in T3cm, it was not as severe, hence
T3cm was able to produce comparable crop yield to T5cm and T4cm. The yield loss in
T2cm was 3.5 times more than that of T3cm and 14 times more than that of T4cm. The
lowest yield reduction was observed in T4cm at 1.57%.

3.7. Water Use Efficiency
Table 7 highlights the results in terms of the amount of rainfall, irrigation, and
water use efficiency. Cumulative rainfall recorded from transplanting to harvest
represented 35%, 43%, 58%, and 87% of the gross irrigation water applied in
T5cm, T4cm, T3cm, and T2cm, respectively. The highest rainwater productivity was
achieved in T5cm (2.07 kg/m3), and then gradually decreased to the lowest water
treatment T2cm (1.62 kg/m3). The highest total water productivity, 0.75 kg/m3,
19
and irrigation water productivity, 1.40 kg/m3, were observed in the lowest water
treatment T2cm. The lowest grain production loss (0.06 kg) was observed in T4cm,
indicating that 0.06 kg of grain was lost for saving 1 m3 of water. Therefore, based
on lowest yield reduction (1.57%) and grain production loss (0.06 kg), the weekly
application of 4 cmponded water depth led to optimal water productivity and a water
saving of 20%, and appeared suitable and beneficial for rice crops. In conducting
similar research with an emphasis on saturated soil culture, Yao et al. [13] explained
that 3 cm soil saturation provided the best results based on lowest yield reduction,
lowest grain production loss, and water savings. However, other variables such
as environmental conditions and crop variety may also determine the outcome of
such results.

4. Conclusions
The challenges to sustaining rice productivity are presently increasing, as there
is greater scarcity of water and more competition for water resources. This study
has shown that AWD can be optimized through efficient irrigation management and
rainfall maximization, thereby concurrently achieving the dual goals of increasing
grain production and reducing the water requirements for irrigated paddy rice.
Rainfall induced favorable watered conditions that rose and kept the soil moisture
content above the soil stress threshold during the final stages of panicle initiation
and throughout the heading stage. The weekly application of T4cm ponded water
depth from transplanting to heading produced the lowest yield reduction and grain
production loss while having no significant impact on yield loss compared to the
highest water treatment, and is therefore suitable for increasing irrigation water
productivity. On the contrary, plants exposed to T2cm ponded water depth were
more vulnerable under soil water stress and showed a reduction in yield components
and overall grain yield. Likewise, the number of daily headed panicle per square
meter was most affected by T2cm (443%) when compared to T5cm. The weekly
application of T5cm ponded water depth from transplanting to heading increased
the rain water productivity but induced low irrigation water productivity; on the
contrary, irrigation water productivity and total water productivity was greater in
20
T2cm. Since rain water use is free of cost, excess use of irrigation water during the dry
season in (T5cm) appeared costly and non-beneficial. By applying T4cm ponded water
depth, and synchronizing the high crop water demand period with the onset of the
rainy season, AWD technique efficiency can noticeably be improved. For sustainable
rice production and agriculture in general, different methods and technologies for
minimizing water usage are explored; however, it has been demonstrated repeatedly
that high rice yields can be achieved under non-flooding conditions, and AWD is
only one of several techniques which offer opportunities to raise rice production
using less water. In this context, combining irrigation and maximizing rainfall can
reduce rice farmers’ need for irrigation water, enhance grain production, and assist
in alleviating food and water shortages in rice producing countries with similar
environmental conditions. Finally, water is not an easily fungible resource, and
the hydrological dynamics across time and place need to be taken into account.
The results presented merit further exploration taking into account additional
water depths as soil hydrological condition, timing of irrigation, crop variety, and
agronomic attributes may also affect crop yield.

Sustainability of Irrigating Winter Wheat in
the East of England—Adaptation at
What Cost?
Daniel El Chami and André Daccache
Abstract: Climate change is “the challenge” of our times and for the next upcoming
decades. The biggest impacts are likely to affect the sustainability of agricultural and
food systems; both highly vulnerable to continuously changing climatic patterns.
Wheat is a strategic crop for food security. It is widely grown worldwide as a
rainfed (unirrigated) crop; but the latest research shows that recent world wheat
price increases and increasing weather variability are making supplemental irrigation
marginally profitable. The proposed study combines the outputs from a general
circulation model (GCM), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) crop growth model (AquaCrop), and economic modelling to assess
the sustainability of irrigated wheat production compared to rainfed crop production
both under current climate conditions and in the future under different climate
scenarios. The AquaCrop model has been calibrated and validated for winter wheat
grown on a sandy loam soil in the East of England (Bedfordshire). Long-term
observed climate data (1970–2006) in Cambridge (Cambridgeshire) were used to
validate the projected climate data from the GCM. Structural characteristics of the
case study were representative of a typical farm of the area, and irrigation costs and
wheat prices for the economic model were calculated assuming current market prices.
In the longer term, a sensitivity analysis was used to assess the expected variations
due to the increase in world wheat prices and the energy costs involved. Results of
the study show that the impacts of climate change on winter wheat grown in the East
of England would be a reduction in the rainfed yield (between −5.4% and −32.9%)
and that the projected economic losses from rainfed winter wheat production would
be expected to range between −24.3% and −36.0%. Irrigation, which does not seem
to be an economic option under the current climate conditions, could be a future
adaptation measure for yield increase (3.9–6.1 t·ha−1) and to improve the financial
appraisal of irrigation investment, which would raise between 41 and 519 £·ha−1.
However, negative externalities are increasing pressures on water and air resources,
for example, an increase of the irrigation water requirements between 25.0% an 39.1%
and global warming potential increases between 2.5% and 21.5%. Finally, the
study suggests further research to incorporate a life cycle assessment model into
the framework for an integrated and comprehensive approach for sustainability
assessment of wheat in particular and agricultural systems in general.

1. Introduction
The sustainability of world agricultural and food systems is highly endangered
by the impacts of climate warming due to the high vulnerability of these systems
to continuously changing climatic patterns [1] (p. 976). At the global scale,
climate impacts are expected to further decrease world crop yields [2]. However,
heterogeneous results are expected at regional levels due to local variations in
agro-climatic conditions [3].
Wheat is the most important crop grown worldwide for food provision and
feed for livestock [4,5]. Given its high adaptability to different climate conditions,
it is grown under very diverse agro-climates extending from Russia to the tropics
and sub-tropics [6]. In many areas, wheat is grown as a rainfed crop, but irrigation
occurs in some areas such as sub-tropics [7].
Literature on the impacts of climate change on wheat production is abundant
but contradictory. Parry et al. [2] adopted statistical analyses to derive agro-climatic
regional yield transfer functions from site-level results under different Special Report
on Emission Scenarios (SRES) and showed that wheat, amongst other cereal crops
(wheat, rice maize, and soybean), is subject to potential yield changes at global levels,
which would expose the global food security to high risks and result in security
consequences [8]. Contrarily, Wilcox and Makowski [9] contradicted the previous
results showing in a meta-analysis that the effects of high CO2 concentrations would
outweigh the effects of increasing temperature and the decline in precipitation
leading to increasing yields depending on the geographical location. However, Supit
et al. [10] used outputs from three general circulation models (GCMs) and a crop
growth monitoring system in combination with a weather generator to demonstrate
that crops planted in autumn and winter, such as winter wheat in Europe, may benefit
from the increasing CO2 concentration in the short run, but if the CO2 increase lessens
or stagnates, yield reductions may occur after 2050.
At localized levels, literature assessing the impacts of climate change on wheat
crop tackled single aspects (e.g., impact on yield and/or water use) and results are
site-specific [11–13]. However, Falloon and Betts [14] recommended an integrated
approach to deal with climate change research, which is lacking so far.
Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the sustainability of winter wheat
production at the farm level, adopting irrigation for adaptation to climate change in
a typical temperate climate in the East of England (UK). It will adopt an integrated
modelling approach to estimate potential trade-offs between water savings, energy
consumption (greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions), and economic benefits under
current and future climate scenarios. This integrated approach makes a significant
contribution to the carbon accounting of crop production in general and the impacts
of intensification through irrigation in particular, and it could be easily replicated
with different case studies and other crops.
26
2. Material and Methods
The study was divided into the following stages:
1. Defining a typical wheat-growing farm for modelling assessment.
2. Selecting the baseline climate data from a local weather station and downscaling
the data according to different scenarios.
3. Quantifying the irrigation water requirements (depths applied) under current
climate conditions and estimating the yield response and yield benefits
from irrigation.
4. Assessing sustainability of the rainfed and irrigated winter wheat using a
selection of financial, environmental, and social indicators under current climate
conditions and future scenarios.
5. Undertaking a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of variation in costs and
market prices.
2.1. Selection of a “Typical” Farm
The case study farm was selected to reflect the regional farm characteristics
in the East of England (Table 1). Therefore, we assumed that the farm was 200
ha, practicing rotational agriculture with winter wheat occupying 50 ha annually.
The on-farm irrigation system was a hose reel fitted with either a raingun or boom,
the most common method of irrigation in the UK according to Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [15], using an all year abstraction
license from a nearby river and a diesel pump. We modelled irrigation needs
assuming a deep uniform sandy loam soil, with a soil depth of 4 m and a total
available water of 120 mm/m, as irrigation in England is more likely to be used on
the lighter, droughtier soils (e.g., [16]); we considered, however, a deep uniform silty
clay loam soil with a depth of 4 m and a total available water of 210 mm/m, which is
a heavier soil given that most wheat is currently grown on heavier soils.

2.2. Climate Data and Climate Scenarios
The observed climate dataset used in this study was daily data (1970
to 2006) from a meteorological weather station located at Cambridge,
Cambridgeshire (52.24◦ N, 0.10◦ W). Data included rainfall, reference
evapotranspiration (ET0), and maximum and minimum temperature for the
historical baseline period (Figure 1).

To generate the future weather dataset, a LARS-WG stochastic weather generator
was used [19,20] to produce daily weather from GCM outputs at a single site.
The HadCM3 was chosen for this study since it was one of the major GCMs
used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment
Report [21], and has been widely used in the literature for climate impacts
assessment (e.g., [22,23]).
The emissions scenarios used are those developed by the IPCC [24] and known
as SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios), in which each scenario combines
two sets of divergent tendencies: one set varies between strong economic values
and strong environmental values, the other set between increasing globalization
and increasing regionalization [25]. The scenarios are commonly known as A1
(economic-global), B1 (environmental-global), A2 (economic-regional), and B2
(environmental-regional). For this research A1 and B1 emissions scenarios were
used; both are characterized by a rapid economic growth and a global population
that reaches nine billion in 2050 and then gradually declines. The A1 scenario
characterizes a future with energy technology balanced between fossil and non-fossil
fuel, whilst the B1 scenario reflects global efforts to control GHG emissions through
the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies (Table 2).

2.3. Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) and Yield Response
The historical baseline and downscaled future climate datasets for Cambridge
were used as inputs for the crop growth modelling. The Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) crop model AquaCrop was used to
simulate potential yield as a function of water consumption. AquaCrop has been
previously tested under similar climate conditions (e.g., [26,27]). Further, El Chami
29
et al. [26] have calibrated and validated AquaCrop for winter wheat crop in the
East of England against experimental yield data obtained from the Broadbalk wheat
experiment at Rothamsted Experimental Research Station (Harpenden, UK).
In this study, the same irrigation schedule adopted by El Chami et al. [28] was
set (irrigation period between 1 April and 1 June applying 25 mm at a 50 mm soil
moisture deficit), to maintain a small deficit in the rootzone to maximize the effective
use for rainfall. Indeed, under typical UK climate conditions, irrigation on winter
wheat is not generally needed before April, and should stop before the beginning
of June with the initiation of flowering [29,30]. Furthermore, experimental studies
in the East of England in the 1990s showed that irrigation on cereals after flowering
would increase the risk of logging [31].
2.4. Sustainability Assessment
To date, considerable efforts have been made to identify appropriate indicators
for agricultural sustainability [32,33], because indicators are one of two basic
approaches to sustainability assessment [30]. Indicators can be divided into
the multi-dimensional components of sustainability (economic, environmental,
and social).
To evaluate the economic efficiency of winter wheat production, a cost-benefit
analysis (CBA) was a key component of the integrated framework for the financial
investment appraisal (FIA) of different options. The net present values (NPVs)
were calculated to assess the economic viability over the life cycle of the project.
Other economic indicators were also selected for this same purpose: the internal
rate of returns (IRRs) to measure the capacity of the net revenues to remunerate the
investment cost, and the benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) to summarize the relative size of
the present benefits with respect to the present costs.
To estimate the economic model parameters, we consider a six-year average
wheat price (2007–2012) as reported by Home-Grown Cereal Authority (HGCA) [34]
for milling wheat. The production costs of the typical rainfed winter wheat farm in
the UK are based on an integration of figures for the 2012 harvest year from Agro
Business Consultants (ABC) [35] and from survey data from Nix [36]. The abstraction
charge calculations are based on Environment Agency charges for 2013/14 [37]. The
capital cost of the irrigation system calculations are based on updated market figures
for similar equipment from a major local equipment supplier (Briggs Irrigation UK),
whilst the variable elements of irrigation costs (labor, fuel, machinery) are based on
an updated analysis of detailed irrigation costs by Morris et al. [38].
The social cost of carbon (SCC) was also calculated. It is defined as the estimated
price of the damages caused by each additional ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) released
into the atmosphere [39], accounting also for the other GHG using carbon dioxide
equivalents. The social cost of irrigation systems was included in the appraisal
30
converting the volume of diesel used in the operation into global warming potential
(GWP) [40] and multiplying it by a ten-year average of non-tradable prices of carbon
obtained from Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC) [41]; the average of
the baseline was from 2008 to 2017 and the projected average of the future scenarios
was from 2041 to 2050.
A selection of water related indicators and CO2 emission indicators were used
to assess the environmental effectiveness of wheat production on water and air
resources. The first indicator is the GWP (tCO2e per hectare) defined as a unit
of measurement that allows the effect of different GHGs and other factors to be
compared using CO2 as a standard unit of reference. Three water related indicators
were selected according to the data available to calculate them: (1) the surface
water withdrawals (WWs), which in this case is the volume of irrigation water
applied on the farm per unit area. This has been introduced by FAO as a key
environmental integrity indicator of water resources [32] and it could be a good
indicator to compare the water savings per hectare between different on-farm
practices. (2) The irrigation use efficiency (IUE) used in the literature as an indicator
to maximize water productivity and sustainably allocate resources [42] and defined
in our case as the ratio of yield increment (t·ha−1) due to the irrigation water
requirement (m3·ha−1). (3) The added value of water (AVW), which is the extra
benefit of irrigation generated per unit volume of water which shows in economic
terms how water contributes to the production value.
To assess the social dimension in this research, we adopted the food security
indicator classified under the safety indicators described by the FAO [30], which
could support shocks and increase human well-being. In this case, food security was
measured through the yield increase (YI). It is also to be noted that income increase
could also be considered as a social indicator, because the extra money generated
could be spent on farmers’ well-being.
2.5. Sensitivity Analysis
Whilst analysts ascribe the current drop in oil prices to political drivers and
objectives [43] similar to those described by Stevens [44,45] behind the non-regulation
of the supply curve to reach a Pareto optimal price, oil prices are, however, expected
to continue their upward trend. Previous estimates suggest that the price of oil is
expected to rise by up to 60% by 2035 with prices of USD 250 per barrel forecasted [46].
This affects farmers, because fuel price is one of the major factors influencing
operating costs for irrigated crops [47]. Further, the cereal price index has been
generally increasing since 2000 and prices by 2022 are projected to be between 12%
and 27% above those of the previous decade [48–51]. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis
was carried out to find out how the added value of winter wheat would respond to
price fluctuations and variations in the total costs of production.
31
3. Results and Discussion
This section first describes the results of simulated yields and the irrigation
water requirements, then the sustainability indicators will be assessed for rainfed
and irrigated production in different soils for the baseline climate and under different
scenarios. Finally, the sensitivity analysis will estimate the variation of the indicators
for wheat price change and for oil prices.
3.1. Yields and IWR Estimates
Under current climate conditions (baseline scenario), the results show that
rainfed winter wheat crops grown on lighter soils (sandy loam) produce 14% less
yield than heavier ones (silty clay loam). The results partially agree with He et al. [52]
who showed that heavier soils have higher water use (WU), hence, wheat grown on
lighter soil textures have good growth and high yields providing there is sufficient
summer rains to replenish soil water.
In the future, rainfed yield is expected to be negatively affected by climate
warming (between −5.4% and −32.9% depending on the scenario and the soil type)
(Figure 2), which confirms the findings of Semenov and Shewry [53] who warned that
a warming climate would have negative impacts on UK wheat; it endorses as well
the results of other studies in similar climate conditions expecting negative impacts
of climate change on winter wheat (e.g., [3,54]). Conversely, the results contradict the
conclusions of Richter and Semenov [55], who predicted a yield increase for winter
wheat of 15%–23% by the 2050s. This could be due, according to Kersebaum and
Nendel [54], to site-specific conditions, as they noted a difference in simulated yield
even within regions as site conditions had a strong influence on crop growth.
It should be noted that the yield variability of rainfed winter wheat under
climate change scenarios is higher than the baseline scenarios (±2.4 for sandy loam
soil and ±1.2 for silty clay loam soil), which has been abundantly stressed in the
literature (e.g., [56,57]). However, irrigation (as discussed in the introduction) could
be an efficient technique for adaptation to climate change as it reduces uncertainties
and increases yields for a future food insecure population (Table 3). However, this
adaptation measure comes at a cost. For the same irrigation schedule, a higher
IWR is required in the future (25%–39% higher) compared to the current conditions
(Figure 3), which is in line with the conclusions of Weatherhead and Knox [58] who
predicted a future rise in irrigation water requirements in England andWales.

3.2. Sustainability Assessment
Currently, under the baseline scenario rainfed winter wheat produced in sandy
loam soils generate 23% more benefits than in silty clay soils; further, irrigation is not
a beneficial option to farmers and generates environmental externalities in terms of
CO2 emissions and added value of water (Table 4).

Under climate change scenarios, the yield reduction for rainfed winter wheat
would cause a benefit loss to farmers between −24.3% and −36.0% on a sandy loam
soil. On a silty clay loam soil farmers would not generate any benefit. These figures
agree with El Chami et al. [28] who suggested that currently the yield benefits do not
justify the investment in new irrigation systems for winter wheat grown in the UK.
However, using existing on-farm unused equipment available between April and
June could be beneficial.
Therefore, irrigation improves the farm economic performances and the added
value of water is higher (Table 4), but this might increase CO2 emissions between 2.5%
and 21.5% according to the SRES scenario [25] selected, the soil type, and the
irrigation system adopted. This range is not as wide as the results of Niero et al. [59]
who assessed the life cycle of spring barley in Denmark under seven alternative
future scenarios and found a GWP variation between −31% and 50% compared
to baseline.
In general, irrigating winter wheat grown in heavier soils might generate higher
incomes, but would require more water (two folds higher) and therefore the CO2
emissions would be higher (Table 4). Further, results under all scenarios show that
raingun systems are not a sustainable on-farm option to adopt; the global warming
potential associated with the use of a raingun system is between 40% and 92.2%
higher compared to the boom systems and the AVW is between 5.4% and 95.4%
lower for rainguns (Table 4). Even though the capital cost of a raingun is cheaper
than a boom, the variable costs and the social cost of carbon are relatively high, which
makes them an expensive option with high pollution related impacts.
Under climate change scenarios, investing in irrigation systems becomes
noticeably profitable and necessary to increase food security (YI: 3.9 to 6.1 t·ha−1).
The higher benefits are observed on a silty clay loam soil and for the high emission
scenario (Scenario A1). However, the highest economic benefits consume the highest
amount of water (WW 1850–1920 m3·ha−1) and generate a lower AVW accompanied
with the highest GWP, which could be two times higher in silty clay loam soils than
in lighter soils (Table 4).
3.3. Sensitivity Analysis
According to the sustainability assessment, the most sustainable practice in the
future to grow winter wheat would be on lighter soils, and given that irrigation
activity would likely be affected by the components assessed in the sensitivity
analysis (e.g., market wheat price and oil price), the sensitivity analysis was
performed on the sandy loam soil and considered the AVW, which is a good indicator
to show in economic terms how water contributes to the production value.
In general, the results of this analysis showed that the AVW is more sensitive to
market price fluctuations than to variations in oil prices (Table 5). However, it is well
36
noted that sensitivity of the AVW when using a hose reel fitted with boom (Table 5a)
is less elastic than when using a raingun (Table 5b), hence a change in oil price would
have higher impacts on the AVW when using a raingun.

4. Methodological Limitations
Certainly, the integration of different modelling approaches adopted in this
study has numerous limitations. The crop growth modelling was based on one GCM
(HadCM3), two scenarios (A1 and B1), one time-slice (2050s), two irrigation systems
(hose reel fitted with boom and with raingun), and two soil types (Sandy loam and
silty clay loam). A more detailed assessment would need to consider the entire
range of projections and different soil types and irrigation systems in order to better
quantify modelling errors and uncertainties [60].
Even though the irrigation systems used are both sprinklers with the same
theoretical efficiency, the on-site application efficiency might vary from one system to
another and abstraction efficiency might also be different. The study did not account
for application and abstraction efficiency, which may have reduced the accuracy
to estimate the applied IWRs and the ground and surface WW to assess the water
related indicators.
Finally, the research accounted only for the GHG emissions generated from
irrigation pumping and did not include the total emissions of the production
generated through the life cycle of the wheat crop. This might have led to an
underestimation in the results for the generated indicators.
37
5. Conclusions
This study confirmed that climate change would have negative impacts on
winter wheat production in the East of England. These impacts are site-specific and
highly depend on the agro-climatic conditions of the farm. Climate change impacts
are also extremely dependent on soil types. The rainfed yields would be reduced by
between −5.4% and −32.9% according to the soil type.
In economic terms, rainfed winter wheat under climate change would cost
farmers between −24.3% and −36.0% of the benefit margin. However, irrigation
could be a beneficial adaptation measure for farmers to increase future yields (YI
between 3.1 and 6.1 t·ha−1) and reduce yield uncertainties. It could generate
economic benefits that vary depending on the irrigation systems selected (FIA
between 41 and 519 £·ha−1), the SRES scenario [25] adopted, and the soil type.
Irrigation might generate environmental externalities and might increase
pressure on water and air resources as the irrigation water requirements increase
between 25.0% and 39.1% compared to the baseline scenario, and the global warming
potential increases between 2.5% and 21.5%. However, the selection of irrigation
systems with low energy consumption would limit the environmental impacts to a
minimum. As such, hose reels fitted with boom compared to hose reels fitted with
raingun showed to be a more sustainable option which should be considered in the
future in order to increase food security.
Finally, this research has attempted to integrate different modelling approaches
to assess the sustainability of a wheat production system in a humid climate.
However, for a comprehensive framework to be adopted and replicated in different
agro-climatic conditions, different crops and a bigger range of SRES scenarios, a life
cycle assessment model should be incorporated into the framework for wheat in
particular and agricultural systems in general.

Abstract: Wetlands are under increasing pressure from population growth, poverty
and economic inequality; social and economic conflicts between local communities;
and unsustainable use of plant and animal resources. Agriculture is considered to be
one of the important factors affecting wetlands. The overall purpose of this research
is to design a participatory management pattern for rice farmers considering the
sustainability of Fereydoon Kenar’s wetland site in Mazandaran Province, Iran. The
entire population are landowners on the wetland site (N = 3249), of which 345 rice
farmers were selected as a sample using the Cochran formula. To analyze the data
from the questionnaires, SPSSWin19 and Amos Software were used. Based on the
farmers’ opinions, development of nursery, employment of rice farmers during the
second six month of the year after the rice harvest, and tree planting in the main
habitats of the birds (Damgahs) in order to exploit their benefits were considered to
be the most important indicators of economic sustainability in the Fereydoon Kenar
wetland. The results of the path analysis showed that the environmental, structural,
educational and policy-making mechanisms had significant effects on the rice
farmers’ knowledge about participatory management of wetlands. Meanwhile, the
structural, educational, and cultural mechanisms, and knowledge about participatory
management had significant effects on rice farmers’ attitudes towards participatory
management in sustainability of the wetland. In addition, the structural mechanisms,
knowledge of participatory management in economic sustainability, and attitudes of
rice farmers towards participatory sustainable management had a significant and
positive effect on the behavior of participatory management.
1. Introduction
Wetlands are among the most important ecosystems and life zones in the world,
which absolutely have no replacement. The ecological value of wetlands is ten times
more than forests and 200 times greater than agricultural lands. Wetlands are one of
the most important basic environmental resources. As they are located in the lowest
parts of the watersheds, they are usually affected by changes and evolutions of the
44
upstream. This can cause problems such as reduction in water entering the wetlands
from surface water resources and groundwater watersheds and plains around
the wetlands (failing to meet environmental water rights of wetlands), especially
due to dam construction projects and inter-basin water transmission; destruction
and sedimentation of wetland area; pollutions caused by urban, industrial and
agricultural activities; unsustainable exploitation of plant and animal species in
the wetland, particularly illegal and excessive hunting and fishing and harvesting
of forage and other wetland products more than wetland’s renewable ability; the
development of unsustainable activities in wetlands; and the access of non-native
and raider species into the wetlands, particularly Azolla [1].
The existence of wetland areas in northern Iran and the southern shores of the
Caspian Sea receive a significant population of immigrant waterfowl every year and
these aquatic habitats form the shelter of diverse plants and animal species. Among
the northern Iranian wetlands, Fereydoon Kenar’s wetland site in Mazandaran
Province, with an area equivalent to 5427 hectares, consists of Fereydoon Kenar,
Ezbaran, and Western and Eastern Sorkh Rud Ab-Bandans, which, annually, receive
nearly one-third of overwintering bird species (150 species) in Iran and also have
the most extensive methods for traditional hunting of birds. This wetland complex
comprises different types of artificial or man-made wetlands and is mainly with
private ownership, which, in fact, is the same agricultural lands revolving around
rice production that are dedicated to the cultivation of this crop during spring and
summer and are submerged in autumn and winter by the water of streams and rivers
and, based on its breadth and depth, can store different amounts of water (Figure 1).
According to the existence of the remains of rice, including seeds or stalks as well as
benthic organisms, these lands are considered as a habitat and overwintering place
for migratory aquatic birds and other creatures that live beside water. Fereydoon
Kenar’s wetland site is also considered an international wetland and has a vital
importance by having the mentioned conditions, thus discussion of its management,
through participation and involvement of stakeholders is essential.
The preservation of natural resources in this wetland, particularly the related
plants and animal species including waterfowl, and the dependency of resident’s
livelihoods on sources of income obtained from hunting the birds of the area,
by considering the social conditions and existed beliefs and values in the region,
determines the undeniable role of the participation of local communities, especially
rice farmers of the region as the owners of wetland areas, more than ever before.
Therefore, to protect and preserve the stable survival of this collection depends on
the participation and wise use of wetland resources by local people. Several cases
are considered in participative management of wetlands that can be classified in
form of economic, environmental, structural, educational, policy-making and cultural
mechanisms. Careful and detailed examination of each of these mechanisms prepares
45
the ground work for designing an optimal model of participatory management for the
rice farmers of this wetland site regarding the wise use of resources and the realization
of sustainable development goals related to wetlands in all three—economic, social
and environmental—dimensions. The aim of this study is thus the design of a
participatory management model of rice farmers for the economic sustainability of
Fereydoon Kenar’s wetland site in the Mazandaran Province.

In his research on the wetlands of the Kisii area in Kenya, Mironga found
that limiting public access to and non-normative use of wetland resources reduced
wetland destruction to a minimum [2]. Robinson et al. believe that structural or
institutional factors such as the lack of appropriate and enforceable property rights,
conflicting interests of stakeholders and problems in clear definition of borders affect
the development of the management plan in the wetland [3]. Maclean et al., in
their research in Uganda, found that ill-defined property rights are often associated
with wetland drainage and unsustainable levels of resource use. The property
rights issues in Ugandan wetlands are afflicted by contradiction and tensions. For
example, there is considerable ambiguity surrounding the concept of government
or local government holding wetlands “in trust for the people”, and confusion over
rights and obligations of ownership on the one hand and management on the other.
Substantial new legislation affecting land tenure and use has been set, but still needs
to be absorbed by all levels of society [4]. Hannan Khan, in a study examining
the participatory management of wetland resources in Bangladesh, found that the
establishment of a state multi-stakeholder system as a structure and institutional
process for stable wetland resource management is essential. The approach of
natural resources management requires the integration of bottom-up and top-down
approaches, which must include the interests of all stakeholders in decision-making
processes relating to wetlands [5]. Legal arrangements for managing wetlands within
46
nation states are not intrinsically different. The legal structures in each state reflect
the historical, cultural, political and constitutional background out of which they
have developed. In response to these factors, wetlands are managed in accordance
with a matrix of constitutional, strategic, regulatory and management rules. Each of
these rules performs a different function within each system. Some are aspirational,
while others are informative; some are facilitative, while others are directional; and
few are mandatory, while others are cast as enforceable obligations, breach of which
leads to a liability in one form or another. Importantly, these rules interact with
and inform each other, and yet perform different functions in ways that point in the
direction of a relatively coherent system [6]. Abila identifies the lack of clear policies
in guiding the use of wetland resources as the main challenge in Kenyan wetlands
protection program [7]. Mironga found that the strong and continuous monitoring
in exploitation of wetlands by beneficiary groups can prevent imposing pressure
on these resources [2]. In addition to coordination between policies implemented
regarding wetlands and their management, executive sponsorship for a set of rules
in this field are most important policy-making mechanisms [8]. Cultural values can
encourage proper behavioral responses relative to the incidence of environmental
changes [9]. The Ramsar Convention about the importance of knowledge, belief
systems and social practices of local people in the management of wetlands held that
local knowledge and skills are made available to assist in the ongoing identification
of problems and solutions in the management of wetlands. Often, this information is
difficult to access and special participatory processes are needed to bring it to the
surface [10]. Table 1 shows a summary of the economic mechanisms extracted from
various studies.

2. Materials and Methods
The present study is considered as applied research in terms of the results, as
combinatory research in terms of implementation process, as deductive research in
terms of implementation logics, as prospective study in terms of time, and also in
terms of the purpose as analytical non-experiential research. Statistical population
of this study is composed of all paddy farmers and landowners of Fereydoon
Kenar wetland site in Mazandaran Province (N = 3249). According to the Cochran
formula [31], the sample size calculated for this study equals 345 farmers with whom
interviews were conducted. In addition, stratified sampling proportionate to the
size of sampling was used to select the samples and the samples were selected
using simple random sampling method in each class. Data were collected with a
questionnaire, the validity of which was approved by a panel of experts and its
49
reliability was confirmed by carrying out a pilot study and calculating its Cronbach
alpha coefficient. The Cronbach alpha values for different parts of the questionnaire
exceed 0.7. SPSSWin19 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 19.0.; IBM Corp.:
Armonk, NY, 2010) and Amos software (Amos, Version 23.0; IBM SPSS; Chicago, IL,
USA, 2014) have been used for data analysis.
3. Results
The results of the farmers’ analysis by age showed that their average age was
over 52 years. Maximum age was 75 years and minimum age was 31 years. In
addition, the majority of farmers had certificate of junior high school or lower levels
of education. On average, their families consisted of four members (Table 2).

In addition, findings on the evaluation of participatory management of paddy
farmers in the economic sustainability of the wetlands using ISDM (Interval of
Standard Deviation from the Mean) method showed that 14.2% of respondents
had a low level of participatory management behavior, 40.6% had moderately low
level of participatory management behavior, 30.7% had moderately high level of
participatory management behavior and 14.5% had a high level of participatory
management behavior (Table 3).

In addition, as can be seen in Table 4, the item of nursery development to
increase income was specified as the highest priority and the item of mushroom
production was specified as the lowest priority in the collection of items related to
participatory management behavior of paddy farmers in the economic sustainability
of wetlands.

In addition, in order to gain a suitable model of the participatory management
of paddy farmers in the economic sustainability of Fereydoon Kenar wetland site,
and in accordance with the literature and theoretical framework of the research, we
tried to select effective variables. Nine variables,
1. participatory management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic
wetland sustainability,
2. paddy farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland
sustainability,
3. paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management of wetland
sustainability,
4. economic mechanisms,
5. environmental mechanisms,
6. structural mechanisms,
7. educational mechanisms,
8. cultural mechanisms, and
9. policy-making mechanisms
were entered in the model.

In addition, as can be seen in Table 6 and Figure 2, the variable of economic
mechanisms had a direct, negative and significant impact on the variable of
participatory management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland
sustainability (β = −0.130, p < 0.05) and had no effect on the two variables of
paddy farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland
sustainability and paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management of
wetland sustainability. The variable of environmental mechanisms had a direct,
positive and significant impact on the variable paddy farmers’ knowledge of
participatory management of economic wetland sustainability (β = 0.174, p < 0.01)
and had no effect on the variables paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory
management of wetland sustainability and participatory management behavior of
paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability. In addition, structural
mechanisms had a direct, positive and significant effect on three variables of paddy
farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland sustainability
(β = 0.241, p < 0.01), paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management of
wetland sustainability (β = 0.296, p < 0.001), and participatory management behavior
of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability (β = 0.638, p < 0.001).
In other words, this variable can be a good predictor of three variables of paddy
farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland sustainability,
paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management of wetland sustainability
and their participatory management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic
wetland sustainability. Educational mechanisms also had a direct, negative and
significant effect on the variables of paddy farmers’ knowledge of participatory
management of economic wetland sustainability (β = −0.271, p < 0.001) and a
direct, negative and significant effect on the paddy farmers’ attitudes toward
participatory management of wetland sustainability (β = −1.034, p < 0.001). In
addition, this variable had no effect on the variable of participatory management
behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability. Policy-making
mechanisms also had a direct, positive and significant effect on the variable of
paddy farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland
sustainability (β = 0.345, p < 0.001) and no significant effect on the variable of
participatory management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland
sustainability. In addition, the variable of policy-making mechanisms had no effect
on the variable of paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management of
wetland sustainability. Cultural mechanisms had a direct, positive and significant
effect on the variable of paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management
of wetland sustainability (β = 0.543, p < 0.001); a direct, negative and significant effect
on the variable of participatory management behavior of paddy farmers regarding
economic wetland sustainability (β = −0.392, p < 0.001); and no effect on paddy
farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland sustainability.
55
The variable of paddy farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic
wetland sustainability had a direct, positive and significant effect on the variables of
paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management of wetland sustainability
(β = 0.349, p < 0.001) and participatory management behavior of paddy farmers
regarding economic wetland sustainability (β = 0.221, p < 0.001). The variable paddy
farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management of wetland sustainability had
a direct, positive and significant effect on the variable participatory management
behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability (β = 0.355,
p < 0.001). In addition, as can be seen in Table 6, policy-making mechanisms had the
greatest total effect on the variable of paddy farmers’ knowledge of participatory
management of economic wetland sustainability. Cultural mechanisms had the
greatest total effect (positive) on the variable of paddy farmers’ attitudes toward
participatory management of wetland sustainability, and the variable of structural
mechanisms had the greatest total effect on the variable of participatory management
behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability.
The stepwise method of multivariate regression test was used to determine
the ability of the independent variables to predict the variable of participatory
management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability.
As Table 7 shows, the four variables of structural mechanisms, paddy farmers’
attitudes toward participatory management of wetland sustainability, and paddy
farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland sustainability
were entered into the regression equation. According to the adjusted value of R2,
these variables are able to explain approximately 50% of changes of the variable
of participatory management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic
wetland sustainability.

4. Discussion and Conclusions
Iran is a country that located at the center of many bird migration paths. In
fact, this country is the main corridor of annual birds migration from northern
China, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, East and West Siberia
to northern Europe, Scandinavian countries located in North-West Europe and
Africa. Accordingly, many wetlands of Iran are a safe haven for many migratory
birds. Fereydoon Kenar, Ezbaran and Sorkh Ruds Ab-Bandans have become
as one of the most important overwintering habitats for migratory birds due to
favorable conditions and abundant food resources. Whooper swan, mute swan,
Bewick’s swan, red-breasted goose, lesser white fronted goose, bean goose, marbled
duck, ferruginous duck, white-headed duck, Eurasian bittern, ruddy shelduck and
dalmatian pelican are among most important bird species in this region. This wetland
is overwintering habitat for the sole survivor of theWest Siberian cranes in the world.
Conservation of natural resources of this wetland, particularly its plants and animals
species including aquatic birds, and its residents’ dependence on bird hunting as an
income source, considering the social conditions, beliefs and values in the region,
further indicate the undeniable role of local communities, especially farmers of the
region.. Therefore, protection and sustainable conservation of this wetland site
depend on the participation and wise use of the wetland resources by locals.
To achieve the farmers’ participatory management pattern in the economical
sustainability of Fereydoon Kenar wetland site, path analysis was used. The
variables used include the paddy farmers’ knowledge of participatory management
of economic wetland sustainability; paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory
management of wetland sustainability; economic, environmental, structural,
educational, and cultural mechanisms; policy-making; and, the main variable,
participatory management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland
sustainability. The results showed that there is a direct negative and significant
relationship between the variable of economic mechanisms and the participatory
management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability.
Perhaps one of the main reasons for this relationship is that the farmers focus on their
livelihoods too much and they have a great attention and desire to earn short-term
gains instead of long-term benefits by the exploitation of wetland resources, and
this is practically in conflict with the principles of wetland’s economic sustainability.
These results are consistent with the findings of Mironga [2] and Kyarisiima et al. [8].
57
There is a direct positive and significant relationship between the variable of
structural mechanisms and the participatory management behavior of paddy farmers
regarding economic wetland sustainability. These results are consistent with the
findings of Mironga [2] in Western Kenya, Dixon [20] and Wood [21] in Ethiopia,
Robinson et al. [3], Shrestha [12] and Hannan Khan [5] in Bangladesh. In other
words, structural mechanisms such as restricting public and unprincipled access to
wetland resources, paying attention to local institutions in the process of wetland
management as a missing link in the development of the relationship between people
and the environment, clarity in defining the rights and obligations of land ownership
and management of wetland site, and paying attention to the discussion of the use
of wetland lands and correcting it, are necessary. Also, establishing a state system
as an institutional structure and process in order to stabilize the decisions in the
management of wetland resources has positive effect on the farmers’ participatory
management in the economic sustainability of wetland.
Moreover, there is a direct positive and significant relationship between the
variables of paddy farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic
wetland sustainability and their attitudes toward participatory management of
wetland sustainability, and participatory management behavior of paddy farmers
regarding economic wetland sustainability. In other words, enhancing the paddy
farmers’ knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland sustainability
and their attitudes toward participatory management of wetland sustainability has a
positive effect on theoir behavior regarding participatory management in economic
wetland sustainabilit. These results are consistent with the findings of Gawler [13],
Wood et al. [21], Mironga [2], Shtestha [12] and Murdiyarso et al. [23].
Furthermore, the stepwise multivariate regression test was used to determine
the ability of independent variables to predict the dependent variable of participatory
management behavior of paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability.
The result of this test showed that, according to the adjusted R2, in total, four
variables, structural mechanisms paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory
management of wetland sustainability, cultural mechanisms and paddy farmers’
knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland sustainability, can
predict approximately 50% of the changes in participatory management behavior of
paddy farmers regarding economic wetland sustainability.
5. Recommendations
• Given the direct, positive and significant effect of structural mechanisms of
paddy farmers’ knowledge, attitudes and behavior regarding participatory
management of Fereydoon Kenar’s economic wetland sustainability, we suggest
the integration of collaborative activities related to wetland management (such
as technical and civil projects, holding training courses, etc.), public participation
58
in this field by establishing a distinct and separate governmental structures for
wetland management, and creating local and participatory associations. This
could be a very good incentive for farmers to participate more in the sustainable
management of wetland sites.
• According to the positive and significant effect of the variables paddy farmers’
knowledge of participatory management of economic wetland sustainability
and the paddy farmers’ attitudes toward participatory management of
wetland sustainability on participatory management behavior of paddy farmers
regarding economic wetland sustainability, we suggest different courses
and workshops on new and alternative options for the livelihood of local
communities with a focus on the exchange of views among experts, farmers and
local menagerie-owners to improve living conditions and increase the income
level of residents. This will aid in the preservation and wise use of wetland
resources and the promotion of sustainable development of Fereydoon Kenar.
• Considering the lack of studies on the economic and environmental value
of Fereydoon Kenar wetland site, we propose separate evaluation of the
wetland resources from economic and conservational aspects as the basis for
any management action taken in this site.

The Use of Indigenous Knowledge in
Subsistence Farming: Implications for
Sustainable Agricultural Production in
Dikgale Community in Limpopo Province,
South Africa
Sejabaledi Agnes Rankoana
Abstract: The present study examined community-based mechanisms of continued
subsistence farming under unfavourable environmental conditions. Semi-structured
interviews conducted with a sample of 250 participants showed that community
members sustain farming through their indigenous knowledge. Community
members continue subsistence farming in their home-gardens and ploughing fields
through indigenous farming practices and rainfall prediction. The practices involve
improvement of soil fertility and structure, maintenance of crops, and seed selection
and storage for future planting. Knowledge of rainfall prediction is helpful in
planning the planting season. These indigenous practices could be helpful in the
achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal on food security,
which requires a nutritionally adequate and safe food supply at household levels.
1. Introduction
Indigenous knowledge is a systematic body of knowledge acquired by local
people through accumulation of experience, informal experiment, and understanding
of their environment [1]. The indigenous systems of crop production emerged
over centuries of cultural and biological evolution and represent the accumulated
experiences of indigenous farmers. The farmers produce indigenous crops through
knowledge of environmental conditions and seasonal change without access to
external inputs, capital, and modern scientific knowledge [2]. After centuries of
cultural and biological evolution, communities have developed locally-adapted,
complex farming systems that have helped them manage a variety of environments
to meet their subsistence needs [3]. Indigenous crop production provides rural
communities with food resources [4].
According to Azam-Ali [5], production of indigenous crops forms the basis
of subsistence agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. Food is produced from cereals,
legumes, cucurbits, cowpeas and groundnuts, bulrush millet, finger millet, sorghum,
gourds, melons, and pumpkins. These crops are produced in subsistence farms
and home-gardens as abundant food sources. For Sigot [6], throughout the African
63
continent, small plots of land near homesteads are used as home-gardens. The
gardens provide households with a range of plants that provide food. VanWyk [7]
posits that indigenous cereals provide food security to small-scale farmers because
they are tolerant of poor soil and drought.
Subsistence farming is rapidly disappearing due to major social, political,
and economic changes [8]. Conservation and management of subsistence farming
practices may be possible only if they are linked to the preservation of the cultural
diversity and economic viability of the local farming populations [8]. Rook [9]
observes that many indigenous crop production systems are characterized by low
productivity and instability of production. Marginal and erratic rainfall is responsible
for poor crop productivity. Poor growth and yield are attributed to low soil and ambient
temperatures which drop below the minimum root and shoot growth temperature
of 10 ◦C [10,11]. The inadequacy and uncertainty of rainfall and its uneven and irregular
distribution is compounded by low fertility and high fragility of soils.
However, indigenous knowledge enables its owners to enhance subsistence
farming at the time of seasonal and climatic variability [12]. Subsistence farming is
sustained through indigenous adaptation mechanisms [13,14], which Reid and Huq
refer to as “community-based adaptation” that “can be defined as ‘community-led
process, based on communities’ priorities, needs, knowledge, and capacities, which
should empower people to plan and cope with the impacts of climate change’” [15].
Indigenous knowledge used in subsistence farming could be promoted as an adaptive
mechanism to sustain the livelihood of rural communities with the potential of
securing food [16]. The present study examined community-based mechanisms of
continuing subsistence farming under unfavourable environmental conditions.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Area
The study was conducted among the Northern Sotho of Dikgale community in
Capricorn District of the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Dikgale community
is located within Polokwane Local Municipality, approximately 40 km from
Polokwane City, and 15 km from the University of Limpopo in Mankweng Township.
The community covers an area of 71 km2 (6 km × 10.8 km). It is situated
between 23.46◦–23.48◦ south latitude and 29.42◦–29.47◦ east longitude. It lies at
an average altitude of 1400 above the mean sea level. The study area is on the
Highveld Plateau, which is bounded in the south and southeast by the Strydpoort
Mountains and in the east and northeast by the Wolkberge. Dikgale area has an
annual rainfall of approximately 505 mm. It has a daily average summer temperature
of between 16 ◦C and 27 ◦C, with the average winter temperature between 5 ◦C
64
and 19 ◦C. Summer rainfall occurs between October and April, followed by a dry
winter season [17].
Dikgale community has a population of about 45,083 with a population density
of 116 per km2. The primary language spoken by community members is Sepedi.
Dwelling units consist of conventional brick houses and fewer huts. The residential
area is made up of demarcated housing stands with a block of ploughing fields
in a flatter and sandy area [18]. A small number of community members grow
subsistence crops in the home-gardens and fields to provide the additional dietary
requirements of a balanced intake [18,19].
2.2. Study Design
A qualitative study was conducted to examine sustainable production of
subsistence crops. Data were collected through direct interactions with participants.
2.3. Participants
The study population was Dikgale community. A short survey was conducted
in the community prior to data collection with the objective of identifying potential
units of analysis. The potential units of analysis were residents in Dikgale community,
whose home-gardens and fields have signs of recent subsistence crop production.
Two hundred and fifty households were purposely selected. Semi-structured
interviews were conducted with 250 bread-winners drawn from the households.
The participants aged between 25 and 87 years. They were 98 males and 152 females.
They consented to participate in the study via signing of the standard university
consent form. The interviews were conducted in Sepedi, the local dialect; in the
comfort of the participants’ own households.
2.4. Data Collection
Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Three master’s students
were trained and have assisted with data collection and analysis. The participants
were asked questions about the indigenous knowledge used to endure subsistence
farming. Data analysis was effected through a computerized software package and
content analysis.
2.5. Quality Criteria
Comprehensiveness and trustworthiness of collected data were attained through
reviews of data with the participants. The participants were able to provide corrections
to the inconsistencies, contradictions, and data gaps. Consultations were made to
validate and clarify data.
65
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Subsistence Farming
The participants were asked to describe subsistence farming. The responses
to this question reflect that community members provide supplemental food
for their families through production of indigenous crops in the home-gardens
surrounding the compound and ploughing fields allocated to each household by the
chief-in-council. The fields are usually located within reasonable walking distance
from the villages and are arranged in a rectangular pattern. An average land holding
is two hectares per household. Strips of uncultivated grassland separate the fields.
Tractors are available for hire at a cost of about 900 South African Rand (ZAR)
per hectare. Planting of crops generally commences after the first rain has fallen.
The seeds are mixed and sown simultaneously to grow the crops together in the
same field.
3.2. The Use of Indigenous Knowledge to Sustain Subsistence Farming
The participants were asked questions relating to the indigenous knowledge
community members use to sustain subsistence farming. The responses provided
show that community members use their indigenous farming practices such as
planting on different soil types, soil fertilization, selection and storage of seeds and
maintenance of crops. In addition to these knowledge systems the participants
mentioned the use of knowledge of rainfall forecast. These indigenous knowledge
systems are produced by local people based on their lived experiences [20]. The Food
and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) [21] attests that local farmers and indigenous
communities have indigenous knowledge, expertise, skills, and practices related to
sustainable agricultural production.
3.2.1. Rainfall Forecast
It was established during the study that the participants use signs, such as the
sprouting tree leaves and flowers, to predict rainfall. The beginning of summer is
marked by the flowing and leaf sprouting of Senegali species. In addition to this
plant phenology, the appearance of stars, moon, and the sun are carefully observed
at the beginning of September, which marks the beginning of a new season. It is
believed that the signs of these celestial bodies denote a good or bad season. For
example, 78% of the participants showed that if mahlapolane (Mars) lies towards
the west, it predicts a good year, but if it disappears towards the east, it predicts
a bad season with little rain. It is also believed that if the horns of the crescent
moon point towards the Earth, it pours out rain, but if it points away from the
Earth, it holds the rain. This indigenous knowledge of forecasting is used to plan the
66
planting season. Whenever a bad season is predicted, farming will not be done until
it rains sufficiently.
The participants’ knowledge of rainfall prediction corroborates Speranza et al.’s [22]
findings that local farmers possess knowledge on the use of local indicators, such as
plants, birds, insects, and astronomy, in predicting rainfall. Kijazi et al. [23] attest that
people use the behaviour of animals and plants to predict the coming agricultural
season. Chang’a et al. [24] show that this type of indigenous knowledge is important
in farm decision-making to respond to anticipated poor yields. The use of Senegali
phenology to predict rainfall in the study is also used by Malunga farmers in Tanzania
to forecast the upcoming rainy season [25].
The participants’ use of celestial bodies to predict rain is corroborated by the use
of the moon and the stars by Chibelela farmers. The farmers use the moon’s shape
and colour as signs to predict a season of either sufficient or scarce rainfall. They
also use the movement of stars to make inferences about the rainfall patterns for a
specific season of the year [25]. Equally, in Uganda the farmers use local indicators,
such as phases and shapes of the moon, to predict upcoming weather [26].
3.2.2. Knowledge of Soil Types
Knowledge of soil varieties by colour and texture, and the types of crops that do
well on particular soil types, was evident among the participants. According to the
participants, black clayey soil is rich in nutrients and good for cultivation of maize,
pumpkin, and gourds. Sandy soil is good for beans, melons, and sweet-reed. Another
type of soil is a mixture of sandy and clayey soil which is good for all crops. These
findings are supported by observations that Zulu subsistence farmers’ knowledge
of soil is based on colour and texture of the topsoil, that dark soil indicates higher
fertility while lighter soil signifies lower fertility [27].
3.2.3. Mulching
It was reported that previous harvest residue in the form of maize stalks, dried
bean and nut plants is a good soil stabiliser. The participants reported that after
harvest, the residue is tilled with the soil to improve moisture retention and fertility
of the soil. This indigenous practice, according to Buthelezi et al. [27], replenishes
depleted soil nutrients.
3.2.4. Soil Fertilization
The participants reported that they apply kraal and poultry manure to make
the soil regain fertility, retain moisture, and avoid pests. This type of soil fertilization
mainly improves soil moisture conservation [28]. In Tanzania, subsistence farmers
understand that if weeds are left to grow, they cover the soil, prevent it from heating
67
up or drying out excessively, induce a positive competition, which simulates crop
growth and reduces erosion during rainfall [29].
3.2.5. Seed Selection
The participants reported that, subsequent to harvesting, the crops are threshed
and carefully stored for use. The seeds are carefully selected for planting in the next
season. Good seeds are selected by colour. Only bright coloured and large-sized
seeds are selected for planting. Sometimes selection of the best seeds is done by
soaking the seeds in water. Only the sinking seeds are selected and the floating seeds
are not selected. Olatokun and Ayanbode [29] observe that Nigerian women cull the
seeds and preserve them for the next planting season. In Ethiopia, the farmers select
healthy crops in terms of maturity period, height, colour, and size. The panicles or
the spikes of the selected varieties are separately harvested, dried, carefully threshed,
and the grains are saved for replanting [30].
3.2.6. Multiple Cropping
Sowing of seeds is done haphazardly by hand. All seed varieties are sown
simultaneously in the same field. This practice maximises the growth of all crops at
the same time in the same field. Inter-planting allows cropping systems to reuse their
own stored nutrients [8]. With this system productivity per unit area is higher than in
mono-cropping systems with the same level of management. The farmers incorporate
a variety of crops with different growth habits in the same field or home-gardens to
maximise the chances for production of multiple crops [14].
3.2.7. Maintenance of Crops
It was reported that subsequent to planting, when the crops are about four
weeks old, weeding commences. Weeds are removed by hand or hand-hoe to avoid
them competing for moisture with the crops, thus disturbing the growth of crops. In
Tanzania, when the farmers regard weed competition as negative for crop growth,
they perform superficial hoeing, and leave the weeds on the soil surface as protective
mulch, to recycle nutrients, and to allow nitrogen assimilation through the bacteria
decomposing the plants [31]. For the participants, when the crops are about to reach
maturity, the women, boys, and girls spend days in the fields scaring birds off the
crops. In many instances a “go-upa” ritual is performed through dispensing of
medicine obtained from traditional health practitioners in the field to permanently
remove birds and marauding animals from the fields. Olatokun and Ayanbode [29]
observe that tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants are used to prevent insect build-up
on the cocoa plantation. In Indonesia, the farmers burn the common lake-growing
plant called Jariamun (Potamogeton. malaianus miq) in the middle of the rice-field to
drive pests from the farm [32].

3.2.8. Storage of Seeds and Crops
After harvesting and threshing, the crops are stored and prevented from attack
by weevils. The crops remain fresh until they are all consumed. The most common
preservation practice mentioned by the participants is by hanging the maize, sorghum
and millet cobs from the hut roof. Sometimes the seeds are mixed with the ash of
Aloe ferox and stored into clay-pots and baskets. The seeds could last for more than
five seasons. Chili pepper (Capsicum annum.) is used to preserve harvested cowpea
in storage [33].
3.2.9. Fallowing
In many instances exhausted fields are left fallow for two to five years. The
participants agreed that this practice helps the soil regain fertility. During fallowing,
cattle, sheep and goats are driven in the fields to browse course grass and that their
droppings should add to soil fertility. Fallowing enables farmers capture the essence
of natural processes of soil regeneration typical of ecological succession [34]. The
use of “green manures”, which is a recent discovery, intensifies the old fallowing
technique in areas where long fallow periods are not possible anymore [34].
4. Conclusions
The study results show that indigenous knowledge is still valuable in the
community. The knowledge is embedded in the community’s cosmology. Knowledge
of plant phenology, and the appearance and shape of the moon and stars is used to
plan the planting of crops. The materials used to fertilise the soil, mulch, manage
crops, and the seeds are procured at the household level. Soil fertilizers, mulching
ingredients and crop management materials are locally developed, always available,
affordable, and culture-specific. The study concludes that subsistence farming is
sustained by indigenous farming practices and rainfall prediction. The practices
involve the improvement of soil structure, maintenance of crops, and the selection
and storage of seeds for replanting. Rainfall prediction helps community members
plan the planting season. This indigenous knowledge is self-developed and relied
upon to generate sustained crop yields to meet subsistence needs. The indigenous
knowledge could be helpful towards the achievement of food security at the
household level. The knowledge could also make contributions to the development
of sustainable adaptation policies to assist rural communities which are vulnerable
to climate change hazards.

Farmer’s Choice of Drought Coping
Strategies to Sustain Productivity in the
Eastern Cape Province of South Africa
Nomalanga Mary Mdungela, Yonas Tesfamariam Bahta and
Andries Johannes Jordaan
Abstract: This paper determines the factors that influence communal farmers’ choice
of coping strategies to sustain productivity during drought and to determine current
adaptation and coping capacities for drought risk in the Eastern Cape province of
South Africa using field surveys, structured and semi-structured interviews and a
multinomial probit model. The results identified three main coping strategies used by
farmers, namely: irrigation, diversification and drought resistant crops/breeds. On
average, most farmers used drought resistant crops/breeds (44%), 32% practiced farm
diversification, while 29% used irrigation. Farmers who receive relevant information,
have experience and receive sufficient income from their work are more likely to
adopt resistant crop varieties and choose suitable animal breeds in case of drought.
Access to water has, of course, a significant impact and is positively related to the
probability of farmers not adopting any coping strategies. The variable risk level
was significant and negatively related to the probability of adopting irrigation as
a strategy to address drought. Record keeping was also highly significant and
positively associated with the probability of using farm diversification to address
drought issues. Education and extension services were not significant. Such viable
strategies to reduce the farmer’s vulnerability to drought and to improve and sustain
productivity should be incorporated into the farmer’s existing strategy to adapt and
cope with environmental uncertainty. Measures such as rain water harvesting and till
practice, keeping reserves, would help them survive through bad years, and increase
their agricultural productivity and sustainability.
1. Introduction
Drought is considered as a normal recurring event that affects people around
the world and is one of the most important natural disasters in economic, social and
environmental terms [1]. Dry periods and drought remain the major meteorological
factors that have devastating impacts on the livelihood of the most rural people in
South Africa. Ngaka [2] estimated that about 65% of South Africa receives an average
annual rainfall of less than 500 mm; this implies that most of the farming in South
Africa takes place under arid and semi-arid conditions. In South Africa, drought is a
major disaster when considering economic losses and the number of people affected.
73
Akapalu [3] argues that people living in rural areas and resource poor farmers are
most vulnerable.
Drought has major implications for the agricultural industry by diminishing
production. Every time drought occurs in South Africa, farmers are the most
vulnerable as they are the first to be exposed to the devastating effects of drought.
According to the Disaster Management Act-57 [4] disaster is declared only when
affected people lack the resource capacity to deal with drought.
Vetter [5] found that droughts will pose an increasing challenge to farmers
in the future, and finding ways to reduce their ecological and economic impacts
should be a major research endeavor. The Red Cross [6] and Mniki [7] focussed on
hazard risk and socio-economic factors, which influenced the potential effects of the
disaster. Before 1992, the focus was primarily on mitigating the impact of drought
on the industrial and commercial agricultural sectors. Jordaan [8] studied drought
vulnerability and coping indicators in the Northern Cape Province. Studies on factors
that influence communal farmers’ choice of coping strategies in the Eastern Cape
Province (South Africa) are, however, lacking.
The Eastern Cape Province is the second largest province following the Northern
Cape in South Africa and is close to 169,000 square kilometres [9]. The province
makes up 13.5% of South Africa’s total population. The Eastern Cape Province is
made up of 45 municipalities which are grouped as follows: one metropolitan, six
district municipalities, and thirty-eight local municipalities. A map of the Eastern
Cape Province showing different regions is shown in Figure 1.
The Eastern Cape is one of the six provinces that were declared disaster areas by
the previous South African president Thabo Mbeki [10]. The Eastern Cape Province
is highly vulnerable to disaster due to a high level of poverty, low standards of
living, environmental degradation, poor household economies and a lack of access
to resources. The Eastern Cape Province not only has the biggest cattle and sheep
herds in South Africa, but is also the place where communal farming is practiced on
the largest scale [11].
The following problems were identified among farmers in the Eastern Cape
Province of South Africa: insufficient water, animals being injured in accidents,
searching for food, receiving early warning information about droughts too late,
lack of resources (tractors, land, capital), drought relief does not reach farmers in
time and they have to wait for officials from a national department for a disaster
declaration. Similar results were found amongst small-holder communal farmers in
the Northern Cape [8].
74
Figure 1. Study areas in the Eastern Cape Province [12].
Hassan and Nhemachena [13] analysed determinants of farm-level climate
adaptation measures in Africa using a multinomial choice model fitted to data from
a cross-sectional survey of over 8000 farms from 11 African countries. Most studies
focus on climate variability and change, adaptive capacity of small scale farmers,
farmers’ perceptions of drought, cost and risk of coping with drought [14–19]. Less
studies deal with factors that influence communal farmers’ choice of coping strategies
and capacities to drought risk. In view of the importance of the subject and the lack
of knowledge with regard to the factors that influence communal farmers’ choice of
coping strategies, it appears useful to undertake a study.
Thus, the main objective of this study is to determine the factors that influence
communal farmers’ choices of coping strategies during drought and to determine
current adaptation and coping capacities regarding drought risk in the Eastern
Cape province of South Africa. To this end, a field survey and multinomial probit
model were used. Conclusions drawn could help develop policies and institutional
interventions regarding coping strategy and capacities. Moreover, an understanding
of factors that influence the choice of communal farmers’ coping strategies is critical
in designing technological and policy interventions for more effective drought
mitigation. This study could not only be applied to South Africa, but to other
arid and semi- arid regions as well.
2. Methodology
The study was conducted in three municipalities in the Eastern Cape Province
of South Africa, namely Cacadu district municipality, Joe Gqabi district municipality
and Oliver Reginald (OR) Tambo district municipality. The focus of this study lay on
the communal farmers, where large scale communal farming is practiced and the
land is still managed by chiefs or local municipalities. One hundred and twenty-one
75
communal farmers were interviewed from the following districts: Joe Gqabi district
municipality (n = 19), Cacadu district municipality (n = 15) and OR Tambo district
municipality (n = 87). Primary data was collected by using a structured questionnaire
survey and focus group discussion from April–September 2014.
A multinomial probit model was used to investigate the factors that influence
the choice of a farmer’s specific coping method. According to Munizaga; Daziano
and Ziergler [20,21], multinomial probit model applications include constrained and
unconstrained versions of the covariance matrix of the multivariate normal distribute
of error term. Assumption of a particular covariance structure is unnecessary as the
data reveals the substation patterns.
A multinomial probit statistical model is used when there are several possible
categories that the dependent variable can fall into. The coping strategies choice
model concerns the decision made by farmer “i”, i = 1, 2, . . . , I of the alternative
j in the set wi = (1, . . . ., j), which produces the highest utility level (Vij). Thus,
Vi1 < Vij,∀j ∈ wi in this notation indicates the choice set is allowed to vary across
individuals to account for their own specific coping strategy. The drought coping
strategies choices denote to 1 for (none of the strategy), 2 (irrigation), 3 (farm
diversification), 4 (resistant crops/breeds) and 5 denote to (more than two coping
strategies). Resistant crops/breeds are chosen as base category (option 4). The
utilities of other choices (1, 2, 3 and 5) are compared to that of the base category. The
individual decision is based on the differences between utility derived from the other
drought coping mechanisms and the base category (resistant crops/breeds). This can
be represented as:
Y∗
ij = Vij − Vij (1)
where Y∗
ij denotes an unobservable choice made, when individual i chooses option j.
If Y∗
ij < 0 for j = 1, ..., J, then Yi farmer I chooses the base category option (drought
resistant crops/breeds) and Yi = 0. Otherwise, farmer i’s choice yields the a higher
value for Y∗
ij and Yij = j. Assuming that each farmer i faces the same j alternatives,
a multinomial probit model formulation based on linear-in-parameters utilities may
be written as follows:
Vij = Zijβ + εij, εij N(0,Σ) (2)
yij =

1

i f Vij ≤ Vij f or i = 1, . . . , I; j = 1, . . . , J
0|otherwise
(3)
The variable Yij denotes the choice made by farmer i, Vij is the unobservable
utility of alternative j as perceived by individual i, Zij is a (1 × K) vector explanatory
variables characterizing both alternative j and the individual i. β is a (K × 1) vector
of fixed parameters, and, finally, εij is a normally distributed random error term
76
of mean zero assumed to be correlated with the errors associated with the other
alternatives j, j = 1,..., J, j = i; and covariance matrix of:
Σ = Cov(εi =
⎛
⎜⎝
σ11 σ12 σ13
σ21 σ22 σ23
σ31 σ32 σ33
⎞
⎟⎠
) (4)
with σij > 0, ∀j(positive definiteness). The predicated probability of choosing any of
the coping strategies choices represented with the following Equations (5)–(9):
P(yi = 1)P(Vi1 + εi1 > Vi2 + εi2 and Vi1 + εi1 > Vi3 + εi3) (5)
P(yi = 2)P(Vi2 + εi2 > Vi1 + εi1 and Vi2 + εi2 > Vi3 + εi3) (6)
P(yi = 3)P(Vi3 + εi3 > Vi1 + εi1 and Vi3 + εi3 > Vi2 + εi2) (7)
P(yi = 4)P(Vi4 + εi4 > Vi1 + εi1 and Vi4 + εi4 > Vi5 + εi5) (8)
P(yi = 5)P(Vi5 + εi5 > Vi1 + εi1 and Vi5 + εi5 > Vi4 + εi4) (9)
Assuming that the response categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive,
then ΣJ
j=1 Pij = 1. For each i, the probabilities add up to one for each individual and
we have only J−1 parameters. This implies that Equation (5) + (6) + (7) + (8) + (9) = 1,
which is rewritten as:
P(yi = 1) + P(yi = 2) + P(yi = 3) + P(yi = 4) + P(yi = 5) = 1 (10)
Multinomial probit was adopted to avoid the limitations of the simpler
multinomial logit, i.e., nonsensical predictions, since the dependent variable is
not continuous, recoding the dependent variable can give different results [22].
Multinomial probit estimates correlation, depending upon choice size and if
correlation is high. Therefore, multinomial probit is designed to be used only if
the options are relatively small [23]. Empirically, the multinomial probit regression
can be written as follows:
Lij = α0ij + αijDij + α2ijKij + α3ijFsij+
α4ijAwij + α5ijAlij + α6ijEsij + α7ijRkij + α8ijEdij + α9ij Iij + eij
(11)
where ij denotes coping strategies (j = 1 denotes no coping strategies, j = 2 denotes
irrigation, j = 3 denotes farm diversification, j = 4 denotes drought resistant
crops/breeds and j = 5 more than one coping strategy). Dij = 1 if farmer i received
information from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development; K denotes
knowledge of a farmer and Fs represents farming experience. Aw = 1 if farmer
has access to water and Al = 1 denotes access to land. Es = 1 if farmer received
77
extension services. Ed denotes educational level (primary, high school or degree).
Rk = 1 if farmer keeps records. I denotes income from farming activities. αoij denotes
the constant term and α1ij,α2ij,.....,α10ij represent the coefficients of the explanatory
variables in the model, while eij denotes the disturbance term.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Demographic and Socio Economic Characteristics of the Respondents
Some of the respondents’ socioeconomic characteristics are provided in Table 1.
More males (73%) than females (27%) took part in the study. A possible reason for
the male dominated farming activities in the study area might be that they have
access to land. Quisumbing [24] reported that there is a great disparity in the size of
landholdings between men and women, and that the mode of women participation
in agricultural production varies with the land-owning status of households.

Many respondents (22%) did not have a formal education, 17% had a secondary
level education and few (4%) had a tertiary education. The demographic and
socio-economic characteristics are important, because they influence households’
economic behaviour [25].
Most (83%) of the communal farmers had access to resources (land) and of
these, 57% were in OR Tambo district municipality, 14% in Joe Gqabi district
78
municipality and the rest 12% in Cacadu district municipality. Forty-two (42%)
communal farmers had access to water area, the majority (29%) were in OR Tambo
district municipality. Forty-two (42%) of the respondent were 55 years or older, 39%
had household sizes of between 5 and 8 people, and 58% of the respondents had
more than 10 years’ experience in farming.
3.2. Determinants of the Choice of Drought Coping Strategies
The multinomial probit regression model was used to examine the factors that
influence the choice of communal farmers’ coping strategies during drought in
the Eastern Cape Province. Table 2 represents maximum likelihood estimates of
the multinomial probit regression model (The detailed results of the multinomial
probit regression model are available in Appendix A, Table A1). Drought resistant
crops/breeds were used as reference category for the multinomial probit analysis,
because most farmers opted for it. Income, experience, access to land and water, and
information from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD)
were variables fitted in the model, because of significant influence the choice of
coping mechanisms.
The coefficient for DARD information is negatively related to the probability of
farmers not adopting any coping strategies and was highly significant at the 1% level.
This implies that farmers who received information from the DARD are more likely
to adopt resistant crop varieties and animal breeds rather than adopting no drought
coping strategies. Information on earlier drought impact is very important for
planning future drought responses. By comparing most severe impacts of drought,
policymakers can plan to minimise the most severe impacts [26,27].
The coefficient for access to water is significant at the 5% level and is positively
related to the probability of farmers not adopting any coping strategies. This result
is plausible, because the farmers who have access to water already have mitigation
strategies to address drought, therefore there might be no need for them to adopt any
other strategies. Communal farmers have access to water, but there was insufficient
and this limits their ability to expand their farming businesses.
The coefficient for access to land had a positive association with the likelihood of
choosing irrigation in favour of resistant crops/breeds with a significance of 1%. This
indicates that farmers are more likely to engage in irrigation especially in the Cacadu
municipality, because 47% of respondents indicated irrigation use. Most of these
farmers produce crops and vegetables, which requires more water compared to other
districts. Contrarily, access to land was significant at the 10% level and negatively
related to not adopting any of the drought coping strategies. This suggests that
farmers are more likely to adopt drought resistant crop varieties or animal breeds,
which will curtail the effects of climate change on their production. Previous studies
79
found that farmers having secure land tenure were likely to take up adaptation
strategies [28,29].

The coefficient of experience correlated with the probability of not adopting
drought coping strategies in favour of adopting drought resistant crops or animal
breeds with a 5% significance. The negative sign of experience implies that farmers
who have been in agricultural production are more likely to adopt drought resistant
crops or animal breeds to mitigate climate change. Experienced farmers have
gathered enough information on weather patterns over a period of time and will
therefore be able to choose the appropriate means to address changing weather
patterns. Similarly, experience negatively correlated with the probability of adopting
irrigation as a mitigating drought strategy in favour of drought resistant crops or
animal breeds. The result implies that experienced farmers are more likely to adopt
irrigation as a drought coping strategy. Developing irrigation facilities may be costly
compared to using drought resistant crops or animal breeds. This implies that
communal farmers are more vulnerable as they do not receive enough income due
to drought impacts. Studies show that the greater the experiences in agricultural
80
farming, the more likely farmers are to have good knowledge about the weather and
climatic conditions and thus adapt. Hisali et al. [28] pointed to the importance of
farming experience in adaptation decision making.
The coefficient of income 3 (South African Rand ZAR 50,000–ZAR 100,000)
was significant at the 10% level and had negative effects on the likelihood of not
adopting any drought coping strategies in favour of drought resistant crops or animal
breeds. The results suggests that farmers with income ranges between ZAR 10,000
and ZAR 50,000 per annum are more likely to adopt drought resistant crop or
animal breeds as mitigating strategy against drought. The reason is that these
farmers have less income and are more vulnerable to drought and thus more food
insecure. Farmers with income 4 (ZAR 100,000–ZAR 200,000) can afford to purchase
drought resistant crops or animal breeds. Moreover, farmers with income level 5
(> ZAR 200,000) are more likely to adopt more than one drought coping strategy
than only drought resistant crops or animal breeds. For example, money can be used
to buy additional feed for livestock to survive until the dry period is over.
The variable risk level was significant at 10% and negatively related to the
probability of adopting irrigation as a strategy to address drought. This implies
that farmers with higher risk levels are less likely to adopt irrigation as a coping
strategy. However, risk levels were positively related to the probability of using farm
diversification as a drought mitigating strategy in favour of drought resistant crops or
animal breeds. Farm diversification may help farmers to cope better during drought
as they have additional crops or livestock to support their main farming enterprises.
The level of perceived risk associated with the capacity to adapt to climate change
determines the likelihood of adopting adaptation measures [28].
Farmers associations are significant at 1%, meaning a probability that those
farmers who receive information from associations have the higher probability of
adopting farm diversification. However, this is not happening as associations do not
operate at grass root level.
Record keeping was highly significant at 1% and positively associated with the
probability of using farm diversification to address drought issues. Record keeping
helps the farmer track climate patterns and the performance of the farming operation
and enables the farmer to explore alternative risk reduction methods associated
with drought.
Even though education and extension services were not significant, they
negatively influenced the farmers’ probability to use one of the coping strategies.
This suggests that farmers can use their education with extension services/support
to make informed decisions about their farming. Furthermore, it reduces their level
of vulnerability to drought when using coping mechanisms. Education is one of the
key determinants in adopting adaptation strategies. Higher education level increases
the individual awareness of different alternatives [30].

3.3. Determine Current Adaptation, Coping Capacities and Strategies Opted by
Communal Farmers
Coping strategies are remedial actions undertaken by those whose livelihoods
are threatened. This involves managing resources both during drought and in
normal times in order to withstand the effects of drought risk. Irrigation, farm
diversification and drought resisting coping capacities and strategies were selected
based on literature, expert opinion, observations, level of ease of measurement and
their importance. It was found that 44% of the farmers used drought resistant crops
or animal breeds, 32% practiced farm diversification and 29% used irrigation on
their farms. Farmers found it easier to farm with drought resistant crops or animal
breeds due to the nature of drought tolerance than with irrigation coping strategies.
Eriksen et al. [31] describe coping mechanisms as the actions and activities that
take place within existing structures and systems; e.g., the introduction of on-farm
diversification. Diversification can include alternative feed and fodder sources or
livestock types [32].
Figure 2 displays that more OR Tambo farmers employ cultivars or breeds that
are less sensitive to drought compared to other two districts. Cacadu district farmers
use more irrigation; therefore, they are less vulnerable during drought as they are
likely to diversify because of high level of water availability. Figure 2 also indicates
that only few farmers employ diversification in their farming activities, which leaves
most of the farmers vulnerable. Nevertheless, farmers who practice diversification
on their farms are more resilient during drought. Farmers can farm with ostrich and
goat since these are recognised to have a potential in the Eastern Cape Province.

Figure 2. Coping mechanisms used by farmers in the Study area.
To manage drought effectively, diversifying livelihood strategies and income
generating options within and outside agriculture is required, especially through
82
non-farm enterprises and employment opportunities. Off-farm income in the three
districts should be explored during drought. Farmers also plant food gardens to
support their families, others keep chickens.
Communal farmers sell their excess animals and non-farming assets to buy feed
for their livestock. Other farmers plant oats to make silage and lucerne for grazing
which can be used in dry periods. The farmers were willing to change the type
of livestock, crops and reduce herd sizes. It was argued by extension officers that
lucerne can be used for fodder banks, but farmers found it too expensive to produce.
The study found that these coping mechanisms assist farmers to cope during
drought. Drought insurance and/or tax free savings schemes can be used as tools to
increase coping capacity and requires further research.
4. Conclusions
This study investigated the factors that influence the choice of communal
farmers’ coping strategies in OR Tambo, Joe Gqabi and Cacadu districts of the
Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Firstly, the results indicate that the choice of
communal farmers’ coping strategies should take into consideration farmers’ access
to land, income, experience, and education. Non-consideration of factors can lead to
the choice of inappropriate coping strategies.
Secondly, the vulnerability and limited coping capacities of farmers is highly
correlated with the inability to access land, water, finance, market and timely
information. In South Africa, drought has significant negative impacts and continues
to pose long lasting effects on the agricultural sector. It was noted that the majority
of farmers had limited abilities to deal with drought issues due to a lack of access to
resources and information.
Thirdly, any viable strategy to reduce the farmers’ vulnerability to drought and
to improve productivity should be incorporated into existing adaptation strategies
regarding environment uncertainty. Measures such as rain water harvesting,
tilling practices, and keeping reserves help farmers to survive and increase their
agricultural productivity. Moreover, disaster risk management committees from
different stakeholders at municipality level could be established and, together with
extension services, improve early warning and information systems. This must
be effectively communicated to the communities before disaster strikes. A holistic
approach between different stakeholders should be practiced.
Generally, the findings highlight the need for policy adjustments with regard
to drought impact, vulnerabilities and lack of coping capacities that take into
consideration communal farmers’ existing coping strategies as well as the factors
that influence the choice of coping strategy.

Applying a Decision Support Model to
Investigate the Influence of Precision
Agriculture Practices on Sustainable
Crop Production
Frikkie Alberts Maré and Hendrik Petrus Maré
Abstract: The concepts of precision agriculture (PA) and sustainability are inextricably
linked. PA can be described as a catch-all term for techniques, technologies, and
management strategies that address in-field variability. Sustainable agriculture, in
short, strives to enhance environmental quality and the resource base on which
agriculture depends. The main objective of the study is to investigate the impact
of PA practices on the sustainability of a crop production enterprise in comparison
with conventional farming (CF). The procedures that were used to achieve the
objective included the scanning of fields with a gamma-ray spectrometer for the
identification of management zones and the application of a decision support model,
namely the Scenario Planning, Analysis and Risk Evaluation (SPARÉ) model, to
investigate the impact of precision agriculture practices on sustainability. Three
crops—maize, wheat, and soya beans—were used in the model to generate the results.
The results of the study indicate that precision agriculture does enhance sustainability,
as the amount of lime and gypsum, fertiliser, and water that are applied per ton of
grain harvested decrease by 22.6%, 11.9%, and 24.1%, respectively, on average for
the three crops, making the resource use more sustainable than with conventional
agriculture. The gross margin of the whole farm scenario increased with 26.9% and,
thus, increased the financial sustainability of the whole farm enterprise.
1. Introduction
Sustainable agriculture has been defined in numerous different ways in the past,
and it is especially due to the debated meaning of “sustainability” that different
definitions exist [1–6]. Sustainable agriculture as a term is defined by the American
Society of Agronomy as “the one that, over the long term, enhances environmental
quality and the resource base on which agriculture depends; provides for basic
human food and fibre needs; is economically viable; and enhances the quality of life
for farmers and the society as a whole.” [7] (p. 15). According to the Sustainable
Agriculture Initiative Platform, “sustainable agriculture is the efficient production
of safe, high-quality agricultural products, in a way that protects and improves
the natural environment, the social and economic conditions of farmers, their
90
employees and local communities and safeguards the health and welfare of all
farmed species.” [8].
Sustainable agriculture is, therefore, the production of food and fibre in a
way that the environmental, social, and economic dimensions are considered. The
environmental dimension include issues such as climate change, energy, water
scarcity, biodiversity, and soil degradation, while the social dimension is concerned
with factors like labour rights, health of communities, accessibility and affordability
of food, food quality and safety, as well as animal welfare. The economic dimension
deals with productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness, where the benefits of these
factors are not only noticed in farm profitability, but also in the rest of the value chain
and will lead to thriving local economies [8].
According to Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer [9], the concepts of precision
agriculture (PA) and sustainability are inextricably linked. PA is a broad concept
that has various definitions, but it can be described as a catch-all term for techniques,
technologies, and management strategies that address in-field variability. It focusses
on the development of integrated information and production systems that manage
variability to optimise long-term, site-specific, and whole-farm productivity, and it
also minimises the impact on the environment and natural resources. The application
of fertilisers and water only where and when they are needed should reduce
environmental loading, while the production is also more efficient and thus results
in lower input costs per unit of output to enhance profitability. There exists a wide
range of technologies that can be utilised to manage site-specific areas within a field.
The adoption of these technologies is based on the farm scale, meaning that the level
at which they become more cost-effective for a farmer depends on the cost savings
for a farm, field, or different management zones multiplied by the area [10].
1.1. Problem Statement and Objectives
It is a simple task to calculate an enterprise budget and physical resource use for
a certain crop under conventional farming (CF) practices, but it is more challenging
to do so for different management zones and to calculate and evaluate the most
sustainable practice for a particular farm or field. This is where the need arises to
utilise a model that aids in the planning, analysis, and evaluation of two different
scenarios for a particular farm and/or field. The large amount of variables, such
as different crops, management practices, mechanisation technologies, variable rate
irrigation (VRI), and variable rate applications (VRA), which must be considered for
PA, highlight the need for a decision support model (DSM).
The main objective of the study is to investigate the impact of PA practices on
the sustainability of a crop production enterprise, and the combination of enterprises
as a whole-farm business, in comparison to CF. The sub-objectives are, firstly, to
identify management zones according to variation in physical soil properties and,
91
secondly, to apply a DSM to evaluate the impact of PA practices on an individual
farm enterprise and the farming business as a whole.
A multidisciplinary approach is needed for agricultural scenario planning,
analysis, and evaluation of profitability and sustainability. There should be a
combined focus on the following aspects, namely agricultural economics, agricultural
mechanization, and agronomic principles. A farming operation is based on all
of the above-mentioned aspects and the interaction between them, but in the
end, the ultimate goal is to achieve financial stability and the sustainable use of
natural resources.
2. Experimental Section
The study is based on irrigation fields situated on the western side of the
Orange River in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. The fields are situated
on the 29◦ S latitude and 24◦ Wlongitude, at an altitude of 1024 m above sea level.
The farm produces maize, soya beans, and wheat in a rotational system. Currently, a
CF approach is followed where all the inputs (irrigation, fertilizer, and amelioration
products) are uniformly applied over the entire field per crop. The input data that
are used in the study were obtained from harvest monitor data, irrigation scheduling
data, physical and chemical soil analysis, and historical data obtained from the
farmer. The six fields that are used in the study cover a total area of 181.95 ha with
an average of 30.32 ha per field.
2.1. Management Zone Identification
Management zones can be identified by using different approaches. The methods
vary from soil type, soil texture, soil depth, precipitation, a combination of all
these, and spatial variation in crop yield characteristics. Steven and Miller [11]
suggest the use of multi-year yield maps. Accuracy and cost issues with the
above-mentioned methods highlight the need for a remote sensing method to
perform in situ measurements and a gamma-ray spectrometer (MS-1200 Type SBG932,
Medusa Explorations: Groningen, Netherlands) was used in this study to take the
measurements for management zone identification.
The correlations according to the count rate (Bq/kg) for the soil properties from
the measurements obtained by the gamma-ray spectrometer are determined for clay,
silt, and sand. The regression values that were respectively obtained for clay, silt, and
sand were R2 = 0.979, R2 = 0.810, and R2 = 0.926. The formulas obtained from the
correlations are then used in a plant available water (PAW) model to extrapolate the
specific property values to all the gamma-ray spectrometer readings. The PAW (mm)
is calculated as:
PAW = FWC −WP (1)
92
where FWC is the field water capacity (mm), and W is the wilting point in (mm).
After the calculation, interpolation and mapping of the PAWto the particular
field boundaries with the use of Spatial Management Systems (SMS) software (SMS
Advanced, 14.50; Ag Leader Technologies: Ames, IA, USA; 2014), the management
zones for SMS can be defined. The physical and chemical properties of the soil
can then be classified into the specific management zones. The VRI and VRA of
fertiliser and amelioration products can then be planned in accordance to the crop
yield potential of the particular management zone.
2.2. Decision Support Model
Due to the different management zones, the large number of variables that must
be considered in calculating the enterprise budget for PA highlights the need to
use a decision support model. The term decision support model (DSM) is broadly
defined by Finlay as “a computer-based model supporting the decision-making
process” [12] (p. 1282). The emphases of the DSM should be on supporting a certain
decision with regard to a problem and not necessarily providing an answer. It must
enable the farmer to base his/her decision on certain outcomes of different potential
courses of action, thus, different scenarios. These scenarios can be based on economic,
environmental, and social factors that may influence a specific choice or outcome.
The Scenario Planning, Analysis and Risk Evaluation (SPARÉ) model was
designed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Excel, 2010; Microsoft: Redmond, WA,
USA; 2010), to plan and evaluate two different scenarios under irrigation and/or
dry land conditions with the use of multiple enterprise budgets per management
zone and different crops per annual production cycle. There are certain designated
sheets for the different production inputs, for instance fertiliser, lime and gypsum,
mechanisation costs, chemical products, and water and electricity. These inputs can
be changed per region, farm, season, etc., and the same cost is used for calculations
in all scenarios [13].
The first step of the model is to use the different management zone areas
and plan the farming operation accordingly. The initial farm planning consists
of rotational crop planning per management zone per season, for irrigation and/or
dry land according to a percentage of available area. After the initial planning is
completed, individual crop enterprise planning should be done per management
zone. This planning process consists of the following variables per zone: seeding,
fertiliser, ameliorants, mechanisation, water demand and management, chemical
products, and other costs. The following variable costs are taken into consideration
to calculate and plan the whole farm business and each crop and management zone
enterprise individually. The variable costs consist of seed, fertiliser, ameliorants,
mechanisation, herbicides, pesticides, insurance, irrigation, transport, marketing,
other variable costs, and interest on operating capital. All of these costs are taken
93
into account to calculate the impact on each enterprise in accordance to the whole
farm operation.
The model’s structure is described in Figure 1, which gives an overview of the
model as a whole from farm information, management zone planning, enterprise
planning, and enterprise budgets to farm income summary, evaluation, and analysis.

All calculations start from management zone level, then the enterprise level to
whole-farm level (all calculations and formulas are available from the authors upon
request). The gross margin (GM) of the scenario (SC) is the final answer with regard
to profitability and is calculated as:
GMSC = GISC − TVCSC (2)
where GISC is the gross income (GI) of the scenario, and TVCSC is the total variable
cost (TVC) of the scenario.
The total income of all the management zones gives the sum of the specific
enterprise and the total of the enterprises gives the sum for the specific scenario. The
GI of a SC is calculated as:
GISC = GIE(Ia+Ib+Ic+Id+Da+Db+Dc+Dd)
(3)
where E is enterprise; I# is irrigation enterprise; and D# is dry land enterprise.
The cost calculations consist of variable costs and are the part of the total cost
component that could vary within the framework of a specific production structure,
as the size of the enterprise varies and/or the intensity of the production per unit
changes. The TVC of a SC is calculated as:
TVCSC = TVCE(Ia+Ib+Ic+Id+Da+Db+Dc+Dd)
(4)
Financial analysis pertains not only to income and expenditure, but also to the
ability to meet financial liabilities, carry risk, and strategically utilise available capital.
The break-even price and yield are simple calculations that can be used to calculate
the minimum price and yield that must be achieved for a particular management
zone or enterprise to be profitable. The operating profit margin ratio is used to
measure the operating efficiency of a farm business and it is usually expressed as a
percentage. The operating profit margin (OPM) for an enterprise E is calculated as:
OPM =


−GME
GIE

% (5)
The SPARÉ model also calculates the total amount of variable inputs used for the
different management zones, enterprises, and the whole-farm operation in physical
quantities. This information can then be used to determine the change in input use
efficiency between PA and CF.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Identified Management Zones
The PAW(mm) of the fields is shown in Figure 2. The field’s clay percentages
vary between 5% and 30% and the PAW varies between 35 mm to above 50 mm.
The infiltration rate is directly correlated with the clay percentage and it varies
between 25mm· hr−1 to as low as 8mm·hr−1. Fromthe variation in spatial PAWdata,
five management zones in pie slice-shaped sectors are identified. The management
zones (sectors) differ in segments of five from below 35 mm to above 50 mm. The
zones are, respectively, 13.9, 47.8, 47.1, 57.3, and 15.6 ha.

96
These identified management zones are used in the decision support model for
the PA calculations. The VRI and VRA of fertiliser and amelioration products are
then applied in the model in accordance to the crop yield potential of the particular
management zone.
3.2. Impact of Precision Agriculture
The impact of PA on the sustainability of crop production will first be discussed
on the basis of economic sustainability and then on the basis of environmental
sustainability. Figure 3 presents a summary of the total income, total variable cost,
and the gross margin for CF and PA. It is evident from Figure 3 that although the
total variable cost for PA is higher than that for CF, the much higher total income
from PA results in a higher gross margin. The total variable cost increase of 0.7%
for PA is, thus, offset by the 10% increase in total income and results in an increase
of 26.9% in the gross margin.

Figure 3. Summary of the total income, total variable cost, and gross margin
of conventional farming (CF) and precision agriculture (PA) in South African
Rand (ZAR).
The operating profit margin (OPM) is 36% and 41%, respectively, for CF and PA
for the whole-farm scenario. Thus, it is 5% higher in the case of PA, making PA more
profitable than CF. This also means that PA has a higher return on investment (ROI)
than CF for each South African Rand (ZAR) spent.
When comparing the individual enterprises according to CF and PA, it is evident
that PA is more profitable than CF. The GM for maize, wheat, and soya beans are,
97
respectively, 22.3%, 27%, and 36.2% higher for PA than for CF. The OPM of CF and PA
for maize is 32% and 37%, respectively, for wheat it is 48% and 54%, respectively, and
for soya beans it is 20% and 27%, respectively. From these figures it is evident that
PA practices are more profitable than CF, with the correct ratio of in-field variation.
While the use of PA does not mean that the total amount of resource use will
be less than with CF, by managing the in-field variability the resource use is usually
more effective. In order to determine the influence of PA on the environmental
sustainability of crop farming it is, thus, necessary to compare the resource use of
PA and CF with the yield. The physical total quantities of resources (for example
fertiliser, lime, gypsum, fuel, and water) used in tons, kilograms, or litres, are thus
divided by the total tonnage of yield for the enterprise to calculate the resource use
per ton of output.
The differences in variable input use for the whole-farm scenario between PA
and CF are presented in Figure 4. The variable input with the largest saving is the
amount of irrigation water applied, which is 24.1% lower in the case of PA. The
variable rate irrigation system that is used for PA only applies water where needed
and, therefore, the total water use in the case of PA is only 180 mm·ton−1, while it
is 237 mm·ton−1 for CF. A total amount of water of 57 mm·ton−1 of yield is, thus,
saved for the specific fields when PA is used instead of CF. The quantities of lime
and gypsum, fertiliser and amelioration fertiliser that are used for PA, also differ
significantly from CF. In the case of PA, 22.6% less lime and gypsum was applied than
with CF, which was a total of 58 kg·ton−1 of yield. The amelioration fertiliser use
was 2 kg·ton−1 of yield less for PA, while fertiliser use was 24 kg·ton−1 of yield less.

4. Conclusions
The findings of this article prove that PA may have a positive impact on the
sustainability of crop farming for both the economic and environmental dimensions
of sustainability. The more sustainable economic dimension was proved by the higher
gross margin realised by PA, while the environmental dimension is more sustainable
due to the more efficient use of variable inputs, such as water and fertiliser. This
finding confirms the findings of Sadler, Evans, Stone, and Camp [14], who found
that variable rate irrigation can reduce water usage, and of Lencsés, Takács, and
Takács-György [15], who state that PA can reduce the harmful effects of chemical use.
The positive impact on the economic dimension will also lead to a more sustainable
social dimension of sustainability, as PA produces food more efficiently and, thus,
enhances both the availability and affordability of food.
It must, however, be kept in mind that the feasibility of PA practices depends on
in-field variation, crop value, economies of scale and the useful life of the equipment.
According to Maine “PA has the potential to enhance profitability on South African
soils, which are characterised by great variability in depth and fertility within given
fields” [16]. VRI is projected to become more essential in the future to protect the
scarce water resources in South Africa and the world. Efficiency in agriculture will
also become more significant in the future, as more food must be provided to a
growing population by using a limited amount of natural resources.
PA is certainly not a new concept, but the adoption of this technology occurs at
a relatively slow rate. The higher investment cost in the case of PA (as opposed to CF)
and the difficulty to calculate the possible returns beforehand withhold producers
from adopting it. This article not only shows what the economic and ecologic
advantages of PA can be, but also provides a model that can be applied to calculate
these advantages for the producer who considers PA as an alternative to CF.

Factors Affecting Sheep Theft in the Free
State Province of South Africa
Willem Lombard,Walter van Niekerk, Antonie Geyer and Henry Jordaan
Abstract: Livestock theft has a big impact on the livestock industry of South Africa
and is threatening the sustainability of the industry. In order to generate information
that can be used to inform sheep farmers on how to effectively mitigate stock theft on
their farms, the objective of this study was to investigate whether the factors affecting
the occurrence of livestock theft are significantly different from the factors affecting
the level of livestock theft experienced in the Free State Province of South Africa.
The study was based on data captured in 292 structured questionnaires completed
during telephonic interviews with livestock farmers in the Free State Province. The
Craggs model specification was used to statistically test whether or not the same
factors affect the occurrence of stock theft and the level of stock theft experienced by
the respondents. The results revealed that factors affecting the occurrence of stock
theft are significantly different from the factors affecting the level of livestock theft.
Technologies used by farmers proved to be significantly related to the occurrence
of livestock theft, while loss controlling actions taken by farmers proved to have
significant relationships to the level of livestock theft experienced. Technologies used
include stock theft collars and alarms. Loss controlling actions include night patrols,
counting animals and access control. The results proved that the stock theft problem
faced by farmers can be divided into occurrence and the level of occurrence aspects.
Thus, investing in controlling actions may decrease the level of stock theft, but not
necessarily stop stock theft. Other challenges faced by farmers that threaten the
sustainability of their farming enterprises should be approached in a similar manner
to generate information that can be used to more effectively overcome the challenge
at hand.
1. Introduction and Background
Livestock theft is nothing new to South African farmers and is considered by
some to be as old as farming itself [1,2]. Recorded cases of livestock theft in South
Africa can be traced back to 1806 [3]. In some African cultures, cattle raiding (livestock
theft) formed a major part of warfare. It was even considered legitimate to enter
neighbouring chiefdoms and raid their cattle during times of peace. These raiders
who returned with large numbers of cattle were seen as heroes, while petty thieves
were despised [4]. Livestock theft is not a problem that is unique to South Africa or
even Africa. Various countries also experience livestock theft and have done research
to try and identify causes and solutions to this problem. African countries include
101
Lesotho [5], Kenya [6–8] Eritrea [9] and Nigeria [10], while other countries include
the USA [11] and Australia [12]. From reviewed literature, it seems that livestock
theft has become more violent and organized in recent years, e.g., with guns are
used in perpetrating these thefts. One of the main causes of livestock theft is poverty
among unemployed and drought-stricken crop farmers [5,7,13].
Livestock theft statistics show that all nine South African provinces are victims
of stock theft [14]. The annual economic impact of livestock theft on the South African
red meat industry (sheep, cattle and goats) for the year 2011/12 was estimated at 300
million South African Rand (ZAR) [15]. This amount is far less than the estimate of
Clack [2] who calculated the 2011/12 annual losses at approximately ZAR 487 million.
The total cost of losses to the red meat sector further increased to approximately
ZAR 514 million in 2013/14 [16].
It should be noted that farmers not only have to deal with controlling livestock
theft [2] but also other problems such as predators [17,18] and extreme weather
conditions (draught, animal diseases, etc.) [19]. As the cost of controlling these
increasing problems, more pressure is placed on the farmer’s profit margin. In some
cases, livestock farmers have already left the livestock industry because of stock theft,
resulting in a shortage of supply and increased prices, threatening sustainability [1].
1.1. Problem Statement
Despite the significant losses associated with livestock theft in South Africa,
the topic has received very little attention from researchers. The authors of this
study could not find any research of factors affecting the occurrence of livestock theft
under South African conditions. Thus, no scientific evidence is available to advise
farmers on how to control livestock theft. The aim of this study was to explore the
factors that have an effect on sheep theft in the Free State Province. The factors were
analysed to determine whether factors affecting the occurrence of livestock theft are
the same as factors affecting the level of livestock theft experienced. As such, a better
understanding of the problem faced by the producers could contribute more effective
response strategies to mitigate livestock theft in South Africa.
1.2. Study Area
The Free State Province of South Africa, which is the focus of this study, is
situated centrally within South African borders (Figure 1). The Free State Province
is divided into five district municipalities: Fezile Dabi, Lejweleputswa, Mangaung,
Thabo Mofutsanyane and Xhariep. The province does not only share its border with
six other provinces, but also with Lesotho. Lesotho, also known as the Mountain
Kingdom, is completely surrounded by South Africa [20]. The border shared between
the Free State Province and Lesotho is 450 km long and is guarded by 100 troops of the
South African National Defence Force (SANDF) [21]. The Free State Province has a
102
population of 2,745,590 [22] with roughly 54,000 people employed in the agricultural
sector of the province [23]. According to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries (DAFF) there are 6065 commercial livestock farming units in the Free
State Province [24]. The province has a total size of 12,943,700 ha, of which 90.9% is
used for farming [24]. Grazing land, which is mainly suitable for livestock farming,
makes up 58.1% of commercial farmland and 66% of emerging farmland [24]. The
Free State Province has the third largest number of sheep as well as cattle, estimated
at approximately 4.8 million sheep and 2.3 million cattle respectively [25].
Figure 1. Geographical location of the Free State Province [26].
1.3. Data
A structured questionnaire was developed to obtain relevant information
regarding livestock theft in the Free State Province. The questionnaire was designed
to be administered during telephonic interviews. The questionnaire was designed
based on the principals suggested by [27] and on a questionnaire used by van
Niekerk [17]. The questionnaire included questions on farmers’ years of farming
experience, age, farm size, farm location and farm topography, losses due to livestock
theft and practices used to control livestock theft. Questions of the practices used
to control livestock theft included methods used, actions taken, how often these
practices are performed and the annual cost of these practices.
Stratified random sampling was applied to select the respondents. Stratified
random sampling is where the population is divided into subpopulations and
103
random samples are then chosen from each subpopulation [28,29]. Livestock farmers
within the Free State Province were divided into different subpopulations within
the province according to their farm’s demographic and topographic location. This
method of sampling was chosen so that comparison and correlation between the
different subpopulations can be done. By following this method, it also ensured that
only livestock farmers were interviewed. The interviews took place between May
and August 2014. Most of the farmers were contacted during the late afternoon and
early evening. In total, 292 farmers completed the questionnaires and were included
in further analyses.
2. Experimental Section
The main objective of this study was to identify factors affecting livestock theft
in the Free State Province. Van Niekerk [17] found that the factors affecting the
occurrence of predation and the factors affecting the level of predation are not the
same. Based on this, it was hypothesised that the factors affecting the occurrence of
livestock theft and factors affecting the level of livestock theft are not the same. In
this study, the model used to investigate factors affecting livestock theft cover two
aspects: whether or not livestock theft occurred and if livestock theft did occur, what
quantity (level or the number of animals) of livestock were stolen. Similar to van
Niekerk [17], the Craggs model was used to scientifically test whether the factors
that affect the occurrence of livestock theft are the same as the factors that affect the
level of livestock theft.
The Craggs model allows for one set of parameters to determine the probability
of livestock theft occurring and another set of parameters to determine the number of
livestock stolen (level of livestock theft) [30,31]. Due to the fact that it is hypothesised
that the factors affecting the occurrence of livestock theft and factors affecting
the quantity of livestock theft are not the same, the Craggs model would be an
appropriate model for the study.
The Probit model was used to model whether or not livestock theft occurred
(yes/no) and the Truncated model was used to measure the level (how much) of
livestock theft experienced. According to Katchova and Miranda [32] the Probit (1)
and Truncated (2) models are represented as follows:
Probit:
P(αi = 0) = Φ(−β

αXi
σ
) (1)
where P = is the probability, αi = quantity of livestock theft, Φ (.) = standard normal
probability density function, β

α = a vector of coefficients, Xi = variable or an S × 1
vector of personal and farm characteristics for farmer i and σ = variance.
104
Truncated:
f (αi|αi > 0) =
f (αi)
P(αi > 0)
=
1σ
Φ( αi−β

αXi
σ )
Φ( β

αXi
σ )
(2)
where: f (.) = the probability density function, P = the probability, αi = the density
(quantity) for the positive values, Φ(.) = standard normal probability density function,
β

α = a vector of coefficients, Xi = a variable or a S × 1 vector of personal and farm
characteristics for farmer i and σ = variance.
It is important to note that the Tobit model returns when the occurrence of
livestock theft estimated in the Probit model (1) and the level of livestock theft
experienced modelled in the Truncated model (2) have the same factors Xi and
the same parameter vector β

α [32]. Lin and Schmidt [30] prescribe the Lagrange
multiplier to test the restrictions of the Tobit model. Greene, Woodruff and
Tueller [33] suggests that the restrictions could be tested by calculating the following
log-likelihood test statistic (3) after the Truncated model, the Tobit model and Probit
model have been calculated.
λ = −2

ln LTobit −


ln LProbit + ln LTruncated regression

(3)
where: λ = likelihood ratio statistic, LTobit = likelihood for the Tobit model,
LProbit = likelihood for the Probit model and LTruncated regression = likelihood for the
Truncated model.
If the Cragg model has a significant p-value (probability), the factors affecting
livestock theft differ significantly from the factors affecting the quantity of livestock
theft. If, however, an insignificant p-value is found, the factors affecting the
occurrence and quantity of livestock theft are the same and the Tobit model should
be efficient for the analysis. The Cragg test was conducted in NLOGIT 4.0 statistical
software (NLOGIT, 4.0; Econometric Software, Inc.: New York, NY, USA, 2006).
Hypothesised Factors
In an investigation of the available literature on livestock theft and the control
of livestock theft, different factors were identified that affected the occurrence of
livestock theft. Two main types of factors can be identified, namely internal and
external factors. These main types of factors can further be divided into sub-groups.
External factors include factors that the farmer has little or no control over. Identified
external factors can be divided into demographic factors and topographic factors.
Demographic factors include factors such as the age of farmers and topographic
factors include farm size and distance from town. Internal factors are the factors that
a farmer can control and include management practices for stock theft prevention and
detection; physical barriers for stock theft prevention and detection; technological
systems for stock theft prevention and detection; animals used for stock theft
105
prevention and detection; and livestock insurance in South Africa. All factors
considered in this study were placed in one of the sub groups.
Note that the hypothesised factors were tested for multicollinearity. None of
the factors proved to have a variance inflation factor above the cut-off value of 10,
therefore no multicollinearity was found to be present.
3. Results and Discussion
The factors affecting livestock theft were investigated by means of a Probit, Tobit
and Truncated regression model specification. The external and internal factors were
analysed separately and are discussed as such.
3.1. External Factors Affecting Livestock Theft
Results for the external factors hypothesised to affect the occurrence and level
of livestock theft in the Free State Province consist of Tobit (level), Probit (occurrence)
and Truncated (level) results which are shown in Table 1. The Craggs test was
used to determine whether the variables affecting the occurrence of livestock theft
are significantly different from the factors affecting the level of livestock theft
experienced. If the factors prove to affect both the occurrence and level of stock
theft experienced, the Tobit model would have been the model of choice. However,
if the factors affecting the occurrence of stock theft prove to be different form the
factors affecting the level, the Probit and Truncated model specifications have to be
used to separately model the probability of occurrence and the level of occurrence.

(not including the constant) are jointly zero. c Numbers in parentheses are associated
with chi-square probabilities. d The likelihood ratio test is given by λ = 2 (ln LProbit + ln

The aim of these regressions was not to predict the probability of livestock
theft but rather identify the internal and external factors associated with a lower
probability of livestock theft. Thus, a significance level of 15% was considered
acceptable for indicating a statistically significant relationship. In order to ease
discussion and identify trends, external factors were divided into suitable categories:
reporting of livestock theft, management of farm workers, demographic factors and
topographic factors.
The Graggs test indicated whether the factors affecting the occurrence of
livestock theft are significantly different from the factors affecting the level of
livestock. Results from the Graggs test (Table 1) indicate that the log-likelihood
test ratio of 125.11 is highly significant (p < 0.01). Therefore, the Tobit specifications
are rejected in favour of the more general Graggs model specification. Thus, external
factors affecting the occurrence of livestock theft are significantly different from the
factors affecting the level of livestock theft in the Free State Province.
The Probit regression (Table 1) identified eight external factors that have a
significant relationship with the occurrence of livestock theft in the Free State
Province. The reporting of livestock theft shows that all of the reporting options
offered to farmers proved to be significant: “report within 0 and 1.99 hours” (p < 0.01),
108
“report within 2.00 and 4.99 hours” (p < 0.01), “report within 5.00 and 12.99 hours”
(p < 0.01), “report within 13.00 and 24.00 hours” (p < 0.10). Strangely, all of these
factors proved to be positively related to the occurrence of livestock theft. Thus, it
does not matter how long it took to report the theft, the probability of the occurrence
of livestock theft increases. Under the management of the farm worker factors,
“paying workers on a monthly basis” (p < 0.15) showed a positive relationship
to the occurrence of livestock theft. This implies that where farm workers were
paid once a month, there was a higher probability for the occurrence of livestock
theft. Results for the topographic factors showed that “plains” (p < 0.01), “distance
from town” (p < 0.10) and “border” (p < 0.01) all related with the occurrence of
livestock theft in a positive direction. Thus, farms with more plains (flatter land)
are more likely to experience livestock theft. This contradicts the findings of Barclay
and Donnermeyer [12] who found that higher stock theft rates are experienced in
hilly terrain. It should also be taken into account that large parts of the Free State
Province are relatively flat. Farms further away from towns have a higher probability
for the occurrence of livestock theft; this agrees with the findings of Barclay and
Donnermeyer [12] but contradict the findings of Bunei et al. [8]. One could argue
that isolated farms create the opportunity for theft without being seen by the farmer.
Lastly, farms close to the Lesotho border are more likely to experience livestock theft.
The external factors that have a significant relationship with the level of livestock
theft experienced in the Free State Province are shown by the Truncated results in
Table 1. Contrary to the result from the Probit model, only the “reporting theft
within 13.00 and 24.00 hours” (p < 0.10) variable proved to be significant in the
reporting of livestock theft category. Thus, farmers who experienced a higher
level of stock theft tended to report a crime 13.00–24.00 h after it was committed.
Management of farm workers had two significant factors: “checking employees’
history (p < 0.10) and “workers go to town every second weekend” (p < 0.10). Both
of these factors had a negative sign for their coefficient. The results thus suggest that
checking employees’ history and taking workers to town every second weekend are
associated with lower levels of livestock theft. One reason why checking employees’
history was associated with lower levels of livestock theft could be that no farmer
would hire a known criminal. In cases where workers are taken to town every second
weekend it could ensure that they are able to buy enough food in town so that they
do not need to steal livestock for food, if that were the case. It could also be a sign that
farm workers are involved in organised crime and could be serving as informants to
criminals when not taken to town, however this result should not be generalized for
all farmworkers.
Demographic factors indicated that “fulltime farmers” (p < 0.15) experience a
lower level of stock theft. This could be due to the fact that fulltime farmers usually
have more time to check up on the livestock and can detect any strange activity on
109
the farm during the day. Topographic factors that proved to be significant with the
level of stock theft experienced was “plains” (p < 0.05) and “size of the farm”(p < 0.05).
When interpreting the direction of signs, plains had a negative sign, meaning farms
which have more plains (flatter) experience a lower level of livestock theft. It could
be that a thief will not easily be able to hide a large number of animals in a flat area
but it could easily be done in mountainous terrain. The size of the farm had a positive
relationship, which means that farmers who have larger farms have experienced
higher levels of livestock theft. This is simply because a farmer will struggle to focus
on the whole farm simultaneously. Paddocks far from the farm house might also not
be in the line of sight to detect any strange activity immediately.
3.2. Internal Factors That Affect Livestock Theft
The internal factors hypothesised to affect the occurrence and level of livestock
theft in the Free State Province were analysed and the results are shown in Table 2.
In order to ease discussion and help identify trends, external factors were also divided
into groups: management practices, physical barriers, technology used, animals used
and actions taken against stock theft.

****, **, * denote 1%, 5% and 15% significance level respectively. Standard errors are
in parentheses. a McFadden R2 is given by one minus the ratio of the unrestricted,
to restricted log likelihood function values. b The chi-square test evaluates the null
hypothesis that all coefficients (not including the constant) are jointly zero. c Numbers
in parentheses are associated with chi-square probabilities. d The likelihood ratio test is
given by λ = 2 (ln LProbit + ln LTruncated regression − ln LTobit).
Similar to the findings for the external factors (Table 1), results from the internal
factors (Table 2) indicate that the log-likelihood test ratio of 134.39 is highly significant
(p < 0.01). Therefore, the Tobit specifications are relaxed in favour of the more general
Graggs model. Thus, internal factors affecting the occurrence of livestock theft are
significantly different from the factors affecting the level of livestock theft. If the
Tobit model were to be used, it would fail to identify the correct factors affecting
livestock theft.
Eight of the internal factors have a significant relationship with the occurrence
(Probit) of livestock theft in the Free State Province. The use of livestock “guards”
(p < 0.15) proved to be the only significant management variable positively related
to the occurrence of stock theft. Thus, farmers who have a higher probability
of experiencing livestock theft are making use of guards. Thus, farmers who
experienced livestock theft on a regular basis have started to use guards in an attempt
to control livestock theft. The only significant physical barrier variable affecting the
occurrence of livestock theft is “corralling at night” (p < 0.01). The positive sign of the
coefficient would imply that farmers who have a higher probability of experiencing
livestock theft are corralling at night. This could be similar to the use of guards
where the sheep are corralled in an attempt to control livestock theft. Three of the
112
technology factors proved to be positively related to the occurrence of livestock theft
and only one negatively. “stock theft collars” p < 0.01), “alarms in corral” (p < 0.05)
and “strategic stock theft collars” (p < 0.05) were positively related, while “light in
corral” (p < 0.15) was negatively related to the occurrence of livestock theft. The
results suggest that farmers who are more likely to experience livestock theft used
stock theft collars. It does not matter whether the stock theft collars are used actively
or strategically. Farmers who are more likely to experience livestock theft placed
alarms in their corrals and farmers who have light in their corrals are less likely to
experience livestock theft. It seems that farmers are using stock theft collars and
alarms because of regular losses to stock theft and that where lights are placed in
corrals, it has led to lower occurrence rates of livestock theft.
None of the animals used to control livestock theft proved to have a significant
relationship with the occurrence of livestock theft. Although it was hypothesised
that many of the actions taken by farmers could influence the occurrence of livestock
theft, only two proved to be significant. “counting animals on a daily basis” (p < 0.15)
was negatively related to the occurrence of livestock theft and “counting animals
more than once a week” (p < 0.05) had a positive relationship to the occurrence of
livestock theft. Thus, farmers who count their animals on a daily basis are less likely
to experience livestock theft and farmers who count two to three times a week are
more likely to experience livestock theft. The results suggest that farmers who count
on a regular basis have a lower probability for the occurrence of livestock theft.
Results from the Truncated regression show (Table 2) that nine of the internal
factors have a significant relationship with the level of livestock theft experienced
by farmers in the Free State Province. Management practices that have a significant
relationship with the level of stock theft experienced by farmers are “theft informant”
(p < 0.01) and “strategic theft informant” (p < 0.10). Taking into account the positive
sign of the coefficient, farmers who are more likely to experience a higher level of
livestock theft make use of a stock theft informant (both actively and strategically).
“strategic collars” (p < 0.01) is the only physical barrier significantly related to the
level of livestock theft experienced. The positive sign shows those farmers who have
a probability of experiencing a higher level of livestock theft corral their animals
during strategic times of the year. Two of the technologies used to control livestock
theft were significant. Both “stock theft collars” (p < 0.05) and “cameras” (p < 0.01)
proved to have a positive relationship to the level of livestock theft experienced.
Thus, farmers who are more likely to experience a higher level of livestock theft
use stock theft collars and farmers who have a higher probability of experiencing a
higher level of livestock theft use cameras in and around their corrals.
As in the case of the occurrence of livestock theft (Probit), none of the animals
used to control livestock theft proved to have a significant effect on the level of
livestock theft experienced. Results show that the actions taken against stock theft
113
contain four significant factors. “Active patrols” (p < 0.01) and “strategic access
control” (p < 0.10) had a positive coefficient, implying that farmers who experience
a higher level of livestock theft patrols throughout the year and farmers who are
more likely to experience higher levels of stock theft control access to their farms
during known troublesome times. “access control” (p < 0.15) and “neighbourhood
watch patrols” (p < 0.10) have had negative relationships with the level of livestock
theft experienced. This implies that farmers who have access control to their farms
and farmers who take part in neighbourhood watches experience lower levels of
livestock theft.
From a management point of view, it seems that farmers who count more often
have a lower probability of experiencing livestock theft than those who count less
often. This could be due to the fact that a farmer who counts his animals more often
will become aware of theft at an earlier stage and thieves will have less time to get
rid of the animals and/or evidence in their possession. Stock theft collars proved to
be significantly related to the occurrence as well as the level of livestock theft with
positive coefficients in both cases. Thus, farmers who have higher probability for the
occurrence as well as the level of livestock theft, use stock theft collars. This could be
an indication of how desperate the farmers who lose large numbers of livestock on a
regular basis are to find a control method that works.
The signs and coefficients of the regression analyses shown in Tables 1 and 2
suggest that farmers should count their animals on a daily basis to become aware of
thefts as soon as possible.
4. Conclusions
Investigation of the external factors proved that eight external factors were
associated with the occurrence of livestock theft and six external factors showed a
significant relationship to the level of livestock theft experienced. Results show that
farmers who report their incidents of crime in any of the offered time slots increase
their probability of experiencing livestock theft. However, farmers who have a higher
probability of experiencing stock theft and a higher level of stock theft report their
cases 13.00–24.00 h after the animals are stolen. The results thus suggest that farmers
who took longer to report their cases were more likely to experience stock theft and
farmers who experienced stock theft at higher level on a regular basis took longer
to report. It could be that those farmers who lost large numbers of animals on a
regular basis are fed up with the thefts and probably feel that it would not help
to report the cases as early as possible. Interesting to note is that plains proved to
be significantly related to a higher occurrence rate of livestock theft and negatively
related to the level of livestock theft experienced. The results suggest that it is easier
to steal one or two sheep in a flat environment; however, it is hard to conceal a large
number of sheep at a time. Thus, thefts occur on a regular basis in small quantities
114
on flatter land, whereas more mountainous areas create the opportunity to steal a
larger number of animals on a less frequent basis. Strangely, it seems that farms
bordering Lesotho experience stock theft on a more regular basis, but not necessarily
on a larger scale than the rest of the Free State Province.
When focussing on the internal factors, eight internal factors had a significant
relationship to the occurrence of livestock theft, while nine internal factors were
associated with the level of livestock theft experienced. Moreover, these results
showed that factors (external and internal) affecting the occurrence of livestock theft
and factors affecting the level of livestock theft are different. Thus, the results from
this study relate to the results that van Niekerk [17] and Badenhorst [18] reported for
predation management.
