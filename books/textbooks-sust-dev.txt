Foreword
THE IMPORTANCE OF TEXTBOOKS IS INDISPUTABLE. States and civil society organisations use them to defi ne which
knowledge to pass on to the next generation and which competencies to foster. Textbooks often become a political issue
because they refl ect a society’s educational canon and the constant negotiation processes that shape it. At the same time,
through their selection of content and pedagogy, textbooks can contribute signifi cantly to peace education, human rights
education, global citizenship education and education for sustainable development (ESD) by endowing young people
with the ability to arrive at independent opinions free of prejudice.
This valuable and timely guidebook represents an innovative contribution to enhancing quality education through
textbooks. It will change the way textbook authors, publishers and educators, as well as governments of the United
Nations Member States, see the potential of educational media at a time of growing violent extremism, changing
notions of national identity, increasingly globalized and diverse communities, and environmental destruction. The need
for education that promotes peace, social justice and global citizenship has become more urgent in a world of greater
uncertainty. This guidebook builds on the momentum of Agenda 2030, providing a toolkit to enable textbook authors
to place ESD at the core of their subjects in ways that are at once practical for them and interesting and relevant to the
students. In fact, it demonstrates successfully how ESD has become an important indicator of educational quality. After
reading this publication, I was deeply impressed by the myriad ways in which subjects such as mathematics can play
just as important a role as science and geography in promoting sustainable development, peace and global citizenship.
This publication reminds us that it is high time to rethink all subject areas, given the interconnected challenges facing
our planet.
The guidebook is also an apt reminder of the ways in which education for peace and global citizenship are inextricably linked
both to each other and to sustainable development. Global citizenship education, for example, emphasizes belonging to
a common humanity and strengthening the concept of solidarity, not just within one’s immediate community but also
on a global scale. This, in turn, demands awareness that global issues require global solutions and cooperation, and a
desire to work proactively with others for a peaceful and sustainable future. Yet long-term peace can only be achieved in
a society that respects diff erent cultures and their human rights, promotes social justice and maintains economic viability
for present and future generations. Peace requires learning to share limited resources equitably and express disagreement
through democratic engagement rather than resorting to violent extremism.
UNESCO and the Georg Eckert Institute (GEI) share a long history of joint commitment to textbook revision, beginning
when Georg Eckert and UNESCO cooperated to support reconciliation between former enemy countries after the Second
World War. Since then, the improvement of textbook quality has remained a central pillar of our collaboration. The GEI
and UNESCO have published several important handbooks and expert studies, among them The UNESCO Guidebook
on Textbook Research and Textbook Revision (1999/2010), a study entitled The International Status of Education About the
Holocaust (2014) and most recently the Toolkit on Revision/Adaptation of Curricula, School Textbooks and Other Learning
Materials to Remove Cultural, Religious and Gender-Biased Stereotypes (2017). Over the coming years, this cooperation with
UNESCO and its institutions, including the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development,
will continue to play a vital role in the GEI’s eff orts to advance a culture of peace in the educational arena.
I am convinced that this guidebook will be an eye-opener for many stakeholders in curriculum and textbook development.
It will help foster a refl ective ethos and a sense of responsibility for a common humanity, empowering students to become
critical thinkers, empathetic citizens and active agents of their communities.

Director’s message
THE WORLD HAS SET AN AMBITIOUS 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with Goal 4 of the Sustainable
Development Goals focusing on quality education – ‘ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote
lifelong learning opportunities for all’.
The United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005–2014) marked a positive beginning in
reorienting and transforming education towards sustainable development. However, many educational eff orts to achieve
a better future for all remain isolated and marginalized. Barring creative initiatives in various parts of the world, valuebased
and action-oriented education eff orts have tended to focus on standalone subjects that normally fall on the fringes
of the curriculum. Education for sustainable development, global citizenship education, peace education, human rights
education, environmental education, development education, global education and global learning, among many others,
have largely been promoted as ‘add-ons’ by celebrating events such as Earth Day or the International Day of Peace. Often
they needlessly compete for space in an already overcrowded curriculum.
Not much systematic work has been done to bring together the community of scholars and practitioners, who focus on
value-based and purpose-driven education, with experts in the design of curriculum ‘core subjects’ to develop a curricular
framework that looks at sustainable development as integral to all subjects. The few exceptions include pioneering eff orts at
the national level by the German government as a joint project of the KMK (Standing Conference of the German Ministers of
Education and Culture) and the BMZ (German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development)1 and Finland’s
new National Core Curriculum.2
This guidebook introduces the approach of embedding education for sustainable development into core subjects, building
on the German initiative as well as consolidating other existing eff orts. This ambitious work began when the UNESCO
Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development (MGIEP), with support from Engagement
Global gGmbH, brought together 30 international experts in mathematics, sciences, languages, geography and education
for sustainable development in Bangalore, India, in June 2016. These experts co-drafted this guidebook.
This publication is designed as a guide for stakeholders in textbook development – education ministries, national curriculum
authorities, textbook writers and publishers – to help them produce a new generation of textbooks. Such textbooks will
make a clear departure from the mechanistic transmission of information and procedural knowledge devoid of meaning
and contextual relevance. They will also advocate a new vision of learning and contribute to fostering young people’s
competencies and capabilities to shape more peaceful and sustainable societies. Competencies such as critical and systemic
thinking, appreciation of diversity, empathy and commitment to change are the key goals of this ambitious publication.
As the next step, MGIEP will organize a series of national and regional training workshops for textbook authors using this
guidebook in diff erent parts of the world. Our goal is to develop the capacities of the stakeholders in textbook development
the world over to produce a new generation of textbooks suited to the 21st century. This fi rst edition includes four subjects
and there are plans for the next edition to include more subject areas and to update the mathematics, science, geography
and language chapters based on the feedback we receive from diverse stakeholders. We also expect to deal more extensively
with the concept of the ‘whole-school approach’ than has been possible in this book. We shall establish an online portal,
which will enable textbook authors to keep us informed about how well this guidebook is meeting their needs and where
it can be enhanced, updated and expanded to serve as a living source of inspiration and guidance.
Despite years of advocacy and research on teaching and learning for a better future, education today is not fully meeting
the challenge of producing citizens motivated and prepared to address the urgent problems facing humanity. With the
publication of this guidebook, we hope to facilitate the process of transforming the education system from within. The
concept of embedding presented in this publication is guided by a vision of a society whose citizens and professionals value
mathematics, sciences, social sciences and humanities for their critical role in achieving human fl ourishing and the common
good. Vital to realizing such a society are teachers and learners at all levels, who are engaged in, motivated by and able to
work together eff ectively on the complex, interconnected issues that require mobilization of all disciplines.
I hope that this guidebook will provide valuable insights and support to help textbook authors identify curriculum
opportunities for embedding education for sustainable development into subject content.

How this guidebook was developed
After the initial project conceptualization and design, we began by conducting basic research into the
existing initiatives for embedding ESD, peace and global citizenship in textbooks around the world.
Experts working at the interface of the core subjects (maths, science, language and geography) and
sustainable development, peace and global citizenship were identifi ed. Twenty-nine experts from
around the world met at a workshop in Bangalore, India, in June 2016. They discussed the basic concept
and developed the initial rudimentary ideas and structure of this guidebook. Five to six experts from
each of the subject groups took on the role of contributing authors and chose a coordinating lead
author (CLA) to oversee the writing of each subject chapter.
Over the next nine months, the chapters went through a series of drafts. These were discussed and
deliberated over, on numerous video conferences across time zones, within each subject group and
with the editorial board. The fi nal drafts of each chapter went through a blind peer review process,
involving at least four reviewers, before making it into this guidebook.
Our aim now is to train textbook writers around the world on the embedding approach, using this
guidebook as a tool. The names of the contributing authors and CLAs are mentioned below, along with
their email addresses. Please feel free to contact them if you have any queries about the subject chapters
and guidebook. For any queries regarding the project, please contact the project management staff .

What is the
purpose of this
guidebook?
THE INTERCONNECTED environmental, economic,
social and political challenges facing humanity call
for education that enables young people to engage
creatively and responsibly with the world. We need
education for sustainable development – education
that ‘empowers learners to take informed decisions
and responsible actions for environmental integrity,
economic viability and a just society, for present and
future generations, while respecting cultural diversity’
(UNESCO, 2014a, p. 12).
This guidebook aims to support textbook authors
and publishing houses to produce a new generation
of textbooks that integrate education for sustainable
development (ESD). By doing so, it aspires to make
learning relevant and eff ective. It also contributes
to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015),
adopted by 193 UN Member States in 2015. At the core
of the 2030 Agenda are 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) – the shared global ambition and
intergovernmental commitment up to 2030 (see
Box 1). Although this guidebook focuses on school
textbooks, its approach should be seen as part of a
wider process of transforming a variety of educational
media – including images, audio and video materials –
to engage students in immersive learning.
The guidebook builds on existing work in ESD and
related areas such as global citizenship education, peace
education, human rights education, environmental
education, development education, global education,
global learning and others. It is intended for the
stakeholders in textbook development: education
ministries, national curriculum authorities, textbook
writers and publishers. It can also be useful for
international and non-governmental organizations
that have a mandate for improving the quality of
education; teacher educators; teachers; principals
and head teachers; school boards; researchers and
practitioners of ESD and related education. It is aimed
at an international audience and recognizes that the
understanding of ESD and the practice of it is contextual
and the priority of sustainable development issues may
vary across education systems. Textbook authors and
educators are encouraged to use this guidebook as a
source of ideas, tools and methods that can help to
enrich content and pedagogy and complement their
own individual and institutional strategies.
What this guidebook off ers is concrete guidance for
textbook authors on how to reorient the existing
curriculum content towards peace, sustainable
development and global citizenship. It primarily
addresses authors of textbooks for primary and
secondary education in four subjects: mathematics,
science, geography and language (English). The
selection of these subjects was a pragmatic and
strategic decision rather than a refl ection of their
importance in relation to others. Time constraints
prevented other subjects from being included and
those selected are ones that will optimize eff orts to
mainstream ESD. Three of the subjects – mathematics,
science and language – are usually core compulsory
subjects in national curricula. Geography is a subject
that naturally lends itself to ESD and provides rich
insights into embedding that could be useful for other
subject areas as well.

Transforming education to shape a
more sustainable world
1.0
Given the accelerating demographic, geopolitical, technological and environmental changes and their associated
risks and opportunities, there is an increasing consensus today on the need to reorient education to meet the
challenges of the 21st century (see Box 2).
The critical task of education in our interconnected and interdependent world is not only to enable people and
communities to adapt to change at local and global levels, but to foster capabilities to transform the world so we
can more fully realize our humanity and protect the biophysical environment on which we depend. This guidebook
helps to address this need to transform education to face and shape the future.
While schools are supplemented increasingly by
other aspects of social life, they remain essential for
developing young people’s understanding of the world
through academic learning and the promotion of the
norms and values of society. Too often, however, school
education fails to create a refl ective ethos and a sense
of responsibility for a shared humanity and the future
of our planet. Our proposal is to begin by taking the
concrete step of transforming textbooks – the teaching
and learning resources that are most prevalent around
the world and the ones closest to students.
In this guidebook, education for sustainable
development (ESD) is used as a broad term
encompassing the transformative education eff orts
included in SDG 4.7. It includes the content (themes
and topics), knowledge, skills, values, attitudes or
dispositions and pedagogies to foster competencies
needed to shape more peaceful and sustainable
societies.1 For elaboration on the concept of
sustainable development and the signifi cance of its
fundamental principles in education, please refer to
Notes on Key Concepts 1.
1 We are fully cognizant of the reality that ESD as a term and concept has come to be associated with particular movements, approaches, stakeholders and topics. With this guidebook,
we use ESD as an umbrella term to facilitate communication by avoiding cumbersome multiple defi nitions. However, we do not wish to suggest that ESD is the only reasonable
overarching, umbrella term for related education such as global citizenship education, peace and human rights education, global education, global learning, environmental
education, development education and others that come under SDG 4.7. MGIEP proposes to take an integrated approach to the implementation of SDG 4.7. Our choice does justice
to the aspirations of ESD as education for ‘sustainable development’, which is now made concrete in the shared global ambition of 17 SDGs.
SDG Target 4.7 is an acknowledgment of the critical importance
of education for sustainable development, global citizenship
education and other transformational education movements for
a sustainable and peaceful future for all:
A global indicator of SDG 4.7 is the ‘extent to which (i)
global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable
development, including gender equality and human rights,
are mainstreamed at all levels in (a) national education
policies, (b) curricula, (c) teacher education and (d) student
assessment’ (UNESCO, 2016a, p. 79). SDG Target 4.7 provides
an unprecedented opportunity to mainstream education for
sustainable development into school education.
‘by 2030 ensure all learners acquire knowledge and
skills needed to promote sustainable development,
including among others through education for sustainable
development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights,
gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and
non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of
cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable
development’ United Nations (2015a)
16 | INTRODUCTION
Over decades, the United Nations has aspired to
make sustainable development an overarching
guiding principle for ensuring a better future
for all. Th e 2015 adoption of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) is clearly a
milestone in this regard. Th e foundational
concept of ‘sustainable development’ was
described by the 1987 Bruntland Commission
Report as ‘development that meets the needs
of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own
needs’ (World Commission on Environment
and Development, 1987). It has remained a
continuous challenge to interpret and apply this
principle to relevant issues at all levels of society
in a rapidly changing world.
Th e term ‘development’ has oft en been
associated exclusively with economic growth.
In the mainstream policy discourse, however,
‘sustainable development’ has become a paradigm for
thinking about development in which environmental,
social and economic considerations (see Figure 1) are
balanced in the pursuit of improved quality of life and
universal values such as human rights.
Figure 1: Classic dimensions of sustainable development
Sustainable development is seen as a process
towards a goal. With growing awareness of the
crucial importance of good governance, a political
dimension can be added to the traditional three
dimensions of sustainable development, underscoring
the role of public participation in community and
governmental decision-making (Figure 2).
Additionally, negotiations among stakeholders of
the economic, environmental, social and political
dimensions of sustainable development have to
respect cultural diversity.
To shape more peaceful and sustainable societies,
all these development dimensions (economy,
society, environment, politics, culture) have to be
Notes on key concepts 1
Understanding sustainable development and the ESD approach
considered as having equal signifi cance, being
mutually aligned in their goals and managed
democratically by the institutions responsible,
including stakeholders and citizens translating
SDGs into individual and collective action.
When applied to education, sustainable
development cannot be prescriptive, that is,
defi ned by ‘planetary boundaries’ or ‘social
thresholds’ as in political resolutions. In
education, this principle off ers orientation in
the learning process and fosters sustainability
as a ‘frame of mind’ (Bonnett, 2002), as a basic
attitude and awareness of interconnectedness.
Education for sustainable development
(ESD) is directed at enabling self-determined
participation in the transformation of
unsustainable paradigms, policies and practices.
It emphasizes the democratic participation of
individuals and local, national and global citizens
in making the changes needed to
move towards a sustainable society.
ESD and related educational approaches are
fostering competencies that enable students to
fi nd sustainable solutions to demanding
issues and prevent confl icts. ‘With its
overall aim to develop cross-cutting
sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is
an essential contribution to all eff orts to achieve
the SDGs, enabling individuals to contribute to
sustainable development by promoting societal,
economic and political change as well as
by transforming their own behaviour’
(UNESCO, 2017a).

What is embedding?
2.0
We live in an increasingly globalized world that is facing grave ecological, economic and societal threats, ranging
from water and energy scarcity to the rise of violent extremism. More than ever, the quality of education is
determined by whether students have access to content and pedagogy designed to foster learning to live together
on a planet under pressure and with a shared respect for human dignity. In other words, education for sustainable
development and global citizenship needs to become a core guiding principle of educational change, for which
there is an international consensus and momentum (see Box 2).
This section explains what we mean by ‘embedding’. While the term ‘mainstreaming’, as in the global indicator of
SDG Target 4.7 (see Box 2), is commonly used to refer to a process of incorporating or including ESD in diff erent
aspects of education systems, we use ‘embedding’ intentionally to refer to a particular strategy for mainstreaming,
as discussed below.
2.1
From periphery to centre
There has been a long-standing international
consensus that ESD should be ‘embedded in the
whole curriculum, not as a separate subject’ (UNESCO,
2006b, p. 17). Already in 1992, Chapter 36 of Agenda
21, which consolidated the international discussion on
ESD, called for integrating ESD – then conceptualized
as the combination of development education
and environmental education – in all disciplines.
Underlying such calls for an interdisciplinary and
integrated approach to ESD is the acute realization
of the cross-cutting and interconnected nature of
sustainable development challenges.
In this guidebook, we use the term ‘embedding’ to
refer to incorporating ESD as an integral element of
curricula and other aspects of formal education, not
as an ‘add-on’. As Figure 3 illustrates, ESD is at the
core of each subject rather than being taught as an
addition on the fringes of the curriculum. Embedding
ESD in all subjects will ensure a stronger and more
eff ective result. ESD goes far beyond education ‘about’
sustainable development. Embedding does justice to
the concept of education ‘for’ sustainable development
by putting its values and principles at the core
of education.

Source: Responses to the challenge of sustainable development, adapted from Sterling 2004 as cited in
Lotz-Sisitka et al (2015) p.73
Mainstreaming ESD into formal education involves
diff erent approaches, ranging from ‘conventional’
ones that conform to existing school systems and
structures to ‘innovative’ ones where there is a radical
force to transform existing institutional structures
(Wals, 2009, p. 49). Stephen Sterling’s model of
responses to the challenge of sustainability (see Table
1) is useful in helping us position embedding: while
being critical of the ‘bolt-on’ approach (b), embedding
can be seen as located in the ‘built-in’ approach (c)
but with the long-term goal of achieving ‘wholesystem
redesign’ (d). This last response (d) involves
‘a paradigm shift and a transition towards doing better
things diff erently (transformation) rather than doing
what we do better (optimization)’ (Lotz-Sisitka et al,
2015, p. 73).
Ideally, mainstreaming ESD should happen within
a ‘whole-school’ approach, with ESD values and
principles being refl ected in the ethos and mission
of the school and being central to the professional
development of its teachers. Obviously, transformation
needs to take place not only in school textbooks but
also in education policies, the curriculum,2 teacher
education and student assessment (see Box 2 for
the global indicator of SDG Target 4.7). The ultimate
goal of embedding is infusion, that is, sustainable
development will have become so deeply integrated
in society and infused through all forms of education
that it becomes indiscernible, an underlying value
orientation and a societal norm (see Box 3).
While there is a widely recognized need to mainstream
ESD not only in all aspects of school life but also at
all levels (from early childhood to higher education)
and in all types (formal, non-formal and informal)
of education, the purpose of this guidebook is not
to reiterate the need for a radical transformation
of the entire education system – which is, for most
countries, an unrealistic proposal. The guidebook
instead proposes feasible embedding interventions
that will make the most of the current situation,
where teachers are prepared to teach subjects and
2 Th e word ‘curriculum’ has a range of meanings in diff erent countries and contexts. In this guidebook, we use the term for a mandatory
government framework for content and pedagogical stipulations in formal education. We also refer to the existence of school curricula in some
places, implementing the mandatory national/regional curriculum by defi ning content, pedagogical means and organizational implementation
in local schools. As summarized in Education for Sustainable Development Sourcebook (2012, p. 8), UNESCO developed tools to reorient a
curriculum to address sustainable development during the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005–2015). For
example, the Education for Sustainable Development Lens: A Policy and Practice Review Tool ‘Review tool 9: ESD integration in the curriculum’
provides a way for analyzing the extent to which ESD is integrated in the curriculum at national and school levels (UNESCO, 2010, pp.
68–69). Th e Education for Sustainable Development Toolkit contains eight exercises for reorienting a curriculum to address sustainability and
holding community forums to gather public opinion related to curricular change (UNESCO, 2006, pp. 84–102). ‘Project Y’ is a tool to integrate
sustainability into existing lesson plans and units (UNESCO, 2006, pp. 87–88; UNESCO, 2012, p. 10).

Th e metaphor of embedding
Th e metaphor of embedding describes the
process of integrating a desirable element
deeply into a system. It is built fi rmly into
the system, as opposed to merely being
bolted on to it. Th e embedded element,
however, is still discernible and it does
not immediately transform the system,
although it may well improve its function.
Embedding is a strategy that opens
up possibilities for transforming the
education system from within by paving
a way to an interdisciplinary curriculum,
issue-based learning and whole-school
approaches (see Box 6 and Box 9).
Th e metaphor of infusion, on the other
hand, describes the process of a desirable
essence permeating and transforming
the milieu in which the system operates.
When infusion refers to the process of
dissolving fl avours from plant material,
an infusion is also the name for the
resultant liquid or solution. In this sense,
infusion is a strategy for ESD integration
that is deeper than embedding and is an
ultimate solution.
The ultimate goal of
embedding is infusion,
that is, sustainable
development will
have become so
deeply integrated in
society and infused
through all forms
of education that it
becomes indiscernible,
an underlying value
orientation and a
societal norm

textbooks are subject based (although issue-based
textbooks do exist). At the same time, it is hoped that
these interventions will open up opportunities for
transforming the widespread silo structure of school
subjects and disciplines, as explained later in this
chapter (see section 3.2).
Given the urgency of putting the world on a
sustainable path, sustainable development can and
should fi nd an appropriate place in the curricula of
all grade levels and subject areas. This guidebook
demonstrates that the core curriculum usually
provides suffi cient accommodative space to address
sustainable development meaningfully, and that
transforming education for a better future for all can
begin today through the ingenuity and commitment
of the stakeholders of textbook development.
2.2
Promoting double-purpose
learning
Embedding is not about inserting new thematic
content into an already overcrowded curriculum,
which would make it impractical – both time and
content wise – for the teacher and textbook author.
Nor is it about removing or minimizing the importance
of academic content. Instead, it is about reorienting
subjects into serving a more socially and globally
relevant purpose: that of contributing to a sustainable,
just and peaceful world, with young people motivated,
prepared and empowered to address persistent and
emerging local and global challenges.
Embedding contributes to learning outcomes – both
in the domains covered by SDG Target 4.7 and the
school subjects. UNESCO (2004) has identifi ed two key
dimensions of educational quality: (1) the promotion of
learners’ cognitive development and (2) the cultivation
of the skills, knowledge, values and attitudes necessary
for responsible, active and productive citizenship.
Embedding, therefore, contributes directly to the
long-established quality agenda of education, as
well as the integrated and transformative agenda for
sustainable development. Too often, the emphasis on
traditional academic learning in examination-oriented
systems has undermined the ‘social, humanistic and
moral purposes of education’ at the heart of SDG Target
4.7 (UNESCO, 2016b, p. 288). Embedding, therefore,
strategically promotes double-purpose learning,
where students acquire subject knowledge and skills
and, at the same time, learn how to contribute to a
sustainable transformation of society – they learn to
live together with a deep respect for the environment
and dignity for all.
There are at least two practical reasons why educators,
concerned with improving student achievement,
should consider embedding ESD in formal education.
First, the shift towards the ideals of an inquiry-based
curriculum in the teaching of the core subjects
has momentum that crosses national boundaries.3

20 | INTRODUCTION
Embedding is a strategy that can be used in subjectcentred
and examination-oriented systems, with
the ultimate aim of transforming them from within.
Embedding aspires to contribute to transforming
school curricula where mathematics and science
are taught like dogmas and social studies fail to
provide meaningful opportunities to learn about
interconnectedness and appreciate diversity. Barring
notable exceptions, ESD eff orts have largely been out
of sync with the eff orts to reform how mainstream
disciplines are taught in school to foster criticalthinking
and problem-solving abilities. It is this gap
that this guidebook fi lls.
Second, there is general consensus that education
systems should provide opportunities for young
people to develop certain key competencies that
allow them to navigate an increasingly complex
world and engage creatively and responsibly with it.
There is also an increasing demand that we should
start measuring these competencies. In 2013, for
example, the Programme for International Student
Assessment (PISA) Governing Board decided to
explore in the 2018 PISA an assessment of ‘global
competency’, which is closely aligned to ESD.4 In the
context of monitoring SDG Target 4.7, UNESCO and
the International Association for the Evaluation of
Educational Achievement (IEA) established an offi cial
agreement to collaborate in the area of measuring
ESD and global citizenship education. IEA administers
the International Civic and Citizenship Education
Study, which will be one of the major sources of data
collection for SDG Target 4.7.
Whereas ESD competency models are still under
much debate and development (Wolbring and
Burke 2013; Scheunpfl ug 2014; O’Donoghue 2015),
there is nevertheless some agreement on the kinds
of competencies required for realizing sustainable
development, albeit with diff erent emphases (see,
among others, Roth, 1971; OECD, 2005; de Haan, 2010;
Wals, 2010; UNECE, 2011; Wiek et al, 2011; Schreiber
and Siege, 2016; Halinen 2017; UNESCO, 2017a).5 Box
5 presents an indicative list of ESD competencies
compiled to support curriculum developers, textbook
authors and teachers in identifying competencies that
can be related to and integrated with subject-specifi c
content, knowledge and skills.6
4 Global competency is defi ned as ‘the capacity to analyse global and intercultural issues critically and from multiple perspectives, to understand
how diff erences aff ect perceptions, judgments, and ideas of self and others, and to engage in open, appropriate and eff ective interactions with
others from diff erent backgrounds on the basis of a shared respect for human dignity’ (OECD, 2016, p. 4).
5 A considerable number of key competencies have been identifi ed or derived from ESD concepts. Th ey are complementary to a holistic idea
of competency. Th e underlying theory of a cumulative process of competency development is manifested, for instance, in the singular use of
the term ‘global competency’ (OECD, 2016), which consists of numerous partial competencies gradually acquired in the learning process.
Th e ESD competencies included in Box 5 are intertwined and overlapping, and they cannot be separated from general basic competencies, such
as creativity. See also Notes on Key Concepts 2: elaborating on the knowledge-action gap and competency models.
6 Th e catalogue of ‘learning objectives’ suggested for ESD in connection with each of the 17 SDGs (UNESCO, 2017a) provides practical help in
this context. Th ey correspond to ‘partial competencies’.
Box 4
Examples of promoting double-purpose learning through mathematics and
science textbooks
For many people, embedding ESD into mathematics is counter-intuitive and sounds like a misguided approach that
dilutes or even pollutes the subject content. As pointed out in the Mathematics chapter in this guidebook, however,
embedding not only ‘show[s] students that mathematics is relevant to the real problems in their communities, but
it also enables students to understand the complex mathematics because it relates to situations they know well’.
For example, mathematics offers students tools for measuring and comparing that can, in turn, help them identify
discrimination and inequities or quantify the effects of actions implemented to address these injustices. The
Mathematics chapter introduces an example of connecting the body mass index (BMI) measurement with issues
of undernourishment in the developing world and the SDGs on eliminating poverty and hunger. This enables
students to understand mathematics while, at the same time, educating and engaging them critically on issues of
inequality and evaluating progress towards addressing such issues (see the Mathematics chapter). A mathematics
textbook, while being an educational tool for teaching mathematics, can develop students’ capacity to contribute
to shaping a more sustainable world.
In science, links to sustainable development are more clearly identifiable. For example, a science textbook, while
teaching ecosystem dynamics, might discuss the issue of declining bee populations as an indicator of ecosystem
disruption caused by human action. Students, through science learning, will be encouraged to view themselves as
having an active role to play in decision-making and problem solving when it comes to interconnected scientific,
technological, social, economic, environmental and political problems (see the Science chapter).

Indicative list of ESD competencies
Acquiring knowledge. Th e ability to collect data and information in a largely selforganized
and target-oriented manner from diff erent sources and with the help of various
tools; to assess their quality and to construct knowledge that is helpful for the solution of
issue-related tasks.
Solving issues, problems, confl icts. Th e ability to contribute to the solving of issues,
problems and confl icts at the local, national and global level by overcoming excessive
self-interest, socio-cultural barriers, racism, ideological diff erences and violence through
negotiating solutions.
Th inking critically. Th e ability to question norms, practices, opinions, attitudes, claims
and decisions – including self-criticism and the acknowledgement of misdoings – when
refl ecting on unsustainable developments with the intention to contribute constructively
to sustainable solutions.
Communicating and negotiating. Th e ability and readiness to communicate
constructively and eff ectively in spoken and written languages as a pre-condition for an
eff ective learning process and with the intention to negotiate over issues.
Dealing with systems. Th e ability to analyze systems and development processes; to
recognize interrelations between local, national and global levels of acting and to assess
the eff ect of human interventions.
Facing the future. Th e ability to analyze risks and to evaluate multiple futures, to link
innovations with sustainable development goals, to create individual and collective
visions, to assess the consequences of actions and decisions and to deal with uncertainty
and changes.
Refl ecting on values. Th e ability and willingness to refl ect on own and others’ norms
and values, to negotiate sustainability principles and goals (in a context of confl icts of
interest, uncertain knowledge and contradictions) with a readiness to revise one’s own
value system and to ensure a balance between pluralism and universal values.
Participating and collaborating. Th e ability and readiness to participate in sustainable
transformation processes, to individually and collectively develop and implement ways
of action towards a sustainable development goal and to intensively and responsibly
collaborate with others.
Changing perspectives. Th e ability to refl ect on others’ situations and feel empathy
for them, to critically refl ect upon diverse perspectives and see things diff erently, to
develop an alternative frame of reference by changing one’s own previously unquestioned
worldviews.
Th inking and acting inclusively. Th e ability to cooperate with people regardless of
their gender, religion, ethnic and social origin, cognitive, physical and psychological
precondition and the willingness to practise tolerance, to contribute to integration and
appreciate diversity.
Showing solidarity and responsibility. Th e ability and willingness to develop an attitude
of global citizenship, to show solidarity for others suff ering from inequity and to share the
responsibility for ecological risks.
The objectives of ESD embrace a broad and
complex range of knowledge, skills, dispositions,
values and ways of thinking that underlie people’s
worldviews and daily behaviour and enable them
to participate in decisions that will improve the
quality of life of everyone without damaging the
planet. We should also keep in mind that not all
desirable competencies can be measured, and
that they will vary with the context. The ultimate
responsibility to create opportunities for students
to develop ESD competencies rests with teachers,
but they can be greatly supported by textbooks
that facilitate inquiry-based and action-oriented
teaching-learning processes.

Notes on key concepts 2
Understanding competencies
Th e ultimate goal of ESD is to foster deliberate
transitioning among knowing, thinking,
valuing and acting. As Glasser (2007, p. 42)
succinctly puts it, ‘awareness of a problem,
accessibility of extensive information on its
origins and impacts, and even stated concern
about it, do not guarantee action …’. Th ere is
still a long way to go before we can fi ll the gap
between our stated desire for a more sustainable
world and our everyday actions. A number
of studies have shown that learners acquire
knowledge, understanding and skills but oft en
lack dispositions – that is, the attitude and
determination – to use them (see, for example,
Asbrand, 2009). Educational reasons for the
knowledge-action gap oft en result from a lack
of insight into complex developments and
formal learning processes that do not allow
for the active and self-reliant involvement of
the students.
Th e curricular documents of diff erent countries
use diff erent terms to refer to knowledge,
skills, attitudes, values and types of behaviour.
Fundamental ethical principles, attitudes and
values are oft en referred to in preambles and
are rarely integrated into curricula explicitly.
Knowledge is sometimes reduced to declarative
knowledge or used as an all-encompassing
term for the outcome of learning and research.
Certain classifi cations, however, have become
standard in many countries, including
competencies, skills, themes/topics, teaching
and learning methods as well as performance
monitoring and assessment.
A widely accepted defi nition of competencies
by the psychologist Franz Emanuel Weinert
(2001a, pp. 27–28) is that they are ‘cognitive
capacities and skills that individuals have or can
acquire in order to solve specifi c problems and
to successfully and responsibly use connected
motivational, volitional and social readiness
and abilities for solving problems in variable
situations’ (translated from the German).
Th is defi nition not only underlines the
integrative character of competencies but also
underscores that they have to be developed
by the learners themselves. Th ey consist of
various elements and are acquired during
action on the basis of experience and refl ection
(UNESCO, 2017a). We need knowledge, skills,
motivation, readiness and an attitude based on
refl ected values to solve problems responsibly
(see Figure 4). Competencies are dispositions
for meeting certain requirements, for fi nding
and implementing sustainable solutions. ESD
competencies (see Box 5), once developed, can
help to face present and future challenges in
variable situations.
Th e notion of competencies was mainstreamed
into education policy circles by the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development’s
Defi nition and Selection of Competencies
(DeSeCo) project, which was initiated in late
1997 and completed in 2003. In 1997, OECD
member countries launched the Programme
for International Student Assessment (PISA) to
monitor the extent to which students near the
end of compulsory schooling have acquired the
competencies essential for full participation in
society. Th e 2018 assessment will focus on global
competency (see OECD, 2016).
In a number of countries, it has become
customary to use the concept of competencies
to describe the result of the teaching and
learning process and to treat the identifi cation of
competencies or intended learning outcomes
as of great relevance to the choice of
content and the overall pedagogic design. Instead
of competencies, some prefer to use the term
‘pedagogical principles’ to refer to principles
that guide teaching and learning processes
(see the Geography chapter). More important
than individual pedagogical tools is their
complementarity in promoting a
learning process.

Making a case for embedding ESD
in textbooks
3.0
Textbooks present a largely untapped opportunity to integrate peace, global citizenship and sustainable
development into formal education. Clearly, textbook-led curriculum development alone is not suffi cient to
foster the skills, dispositional and behavioural learning outcomes called for by ESD. The following section explains
why this guidebook focuses on embedding ESD into the textbooks of core subjects.
3.1
Effi cient and viable
intervention
To date, subject content and textbooks have been at
the heart of formal education, often infl uencing many
aspects of school education from teacher education to
classroom practices. Still, in many countries, textbook
revision is the preferred – in some cases the only –
mode of curriculum development. In countries where
the modern education system was developed under
colonialism, textbooks – more than the syllabus or
curriculum – dictate what teachers teach. Even in
our increasingly digital era, school textbooks remain
‘the most visible part of the curriculum’ and they are
often seen as ‘authoritative sources for the transfer of
knowledge and social values’ (Georgescu and Bernard,
2007, pp. 5–7). For many people, textbooks have
been the fi rst books they have ever read and studied
in depth (Lässig, 2009, p. 2). Many education reform
programmes across the world view the improvement
of the quality of textbooks as a fundamental objective
and have adopted policies and measures to that end.
Producing additional resource materials or providing
teacher education programmes in ESD concepts and
pedagogies (most often manifested as issue-based and
project-based learning activities) is not suffi cient. ESD
needs to be refl ected in the content of what teachers
must teach and the pedagogy they implement,
rather than being treated as an add-on to the main
curriculum. Given the number of instructional hours
dedicated to these subjects and their mandatory and
examinable status, embedding ESD into core subjects
is one of the most eff ective and effi cient ways to
achieve SDG Target 4.7 (see Box 2).
Embedding also produces a change that will leave a
long-term legacy. Textbooks are not often completely
revised. In certain countries, there is still a lack of –
or very limited – teacher preparation and training,
with the result that teachers rely on teaching ‘to the
book or text’.7 Teachers often take their cues from
school textbooks. Although improving the quality
of textbooks is not a panacea, it is an important step
towards transforming education for realizing more
peaceful and sustainable societies. A policy paper by
the Global Education Monitoring Report has called
on governments to review and revise the content of
their textbooks urgently, in line with the core values
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It
calls for these core values to be built into the national
guidelines used during textbook review and taught
in workshops for textbook writers and illustrators
(UNESCO, 2016c).
3.2
Improving content and
pedagogy
By carefully integrating real-life and cross-cutting issues
– such as climate change, poverty and migration – into
textbooks in ways that students can relate to, authors
can improve both content and pedagogy to achieve
more meaningful learning in school subjects as well as
in ESD. Embedding ESD brings textbooks up to date
by integrating the latest insights into the complex and
interconnected local and global challenges in the subject
content. It supports learners’ engagement in deeper
learning by transforming textbooks from a vehicle for
transmitting knowledge into educational resources
that enable students to engage constructively with
the world. Embedding ESD into primary and secondary
textbooks enhances meaning for learners at an age
when they need to relate to and make sense of what
they learn. As the Geography chapter in this guidebook
puts it, content and pedagogy are both improved as
‘abstract knowledge is made concrete, understandable
and meaningful through contextualization … and
facilitating pedagogical approaches’.
Enriched issue-based, problem-oriented content
can open doors for transformative ESD pedagogy,
here loosely defi ned as the student-centred, inquirybased
pedagogical approaches aimed at developing
the agency of learners in participating in and acting

24 | INTRODUCTION
8 Th ere have been eff orts to provide evidence that ESD (as defi ned by UNESCO in the context of the UN Decade of ESD) contributes to quality
primary and secondary education (see, for example, Laurie et al, 2016) or to defi ne essential components of ESD pedagogies (Eilam and Trop,
2010). However, much literature on ESD in a narrow sense is normative or descriptive in nature and represents a modest empirical research
base on ESD pedagogies.
9A number of diff erent constructivist theories by Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky and later Jerome Bruner, Kersten Reich, Keith Taber and many
others, have led to the development of teaching and learning methods and contributed to an extensive list of relevant publications on
pedagogies in a number of languages. ESD pedagogies are informed by experiential learning, problem-based and project-based learning (see
English and Kitsantas, 2013, for useful insights into how to foster student responsibility for learning in diff erent phases in problem- and projectbased
learning), social learning (Wals, 2007) and critical pedagogy, among others. James Coleman (1976, 1979) has described traditional
learning as ‘information assimilation’ and characterized experiential learning as the opposite of traditional learning. Th is familiar call for a
shift from traditional to progressive pedagogies is echoed in a shift from ‘passing on knowledge’ to ‘understanding and getting to the root of
issues’ (Tilbury, 2011, p. 25), ‘a shift from viewing education as a delivery mechanism to a lifelong, holistic and inclusive process’ (Ahmedabad
Declaration, 2007, p. 1) or the ‘move from teacher-centred to student-centred lessons and from rote memorization to participatory learning’
(UNESCO, 2012a, p. 15) called for by ESD.
10 Project-based and problem-based learning pedagogies are styles of inquiry-based learning oft en used in ESD implementation. Th ere are
identifi able diff erences between the two (see the Science chapter, section 3.2.1). Project-based learning approaches (which date back to the early
20th century) usually require the completion of ‘real’ tasks, entailing the application of acquired skills, or are ongoing projects with tangible
‘hard’ outcomes. In this respect, it is a competency-based approach. Problem-based learning is related (and is much more recent as a recognized
strategy) but uses case studies as examples of real-world problems (which may be derived from a scenario or problem set based on authentic
data). When applied to ESD, project- and problem-based learning approaches require students to propose sustainable solutions that balance
interconnected dimensions of sustainable development (see Notes on Key Concepts 1).
on sustainable development issues.8 In essence, ESD
pedagogy constitutes approaches that focus on
learners as active social agents from particular locations.
Like progressive pedagogies employed for particular
school subjects, it is informed by constructivist
learning theories, which posit that learning occurs as
students engage actively in a process of constructing
meaning and knowledge.9 School subjects have their
own pedagogical approaches and methodological
traditions and it is important, therefore, that textbook
authors relate ESD pedagogy to a particular domain.
For example, the Science Chapter in this guidebook
refers to socio-scientifi c issues-based approaches that
have been widely used in science classrooms.
In addition, embedding ESD into textbooks can
pave a way to a more interdisciplinary curriculum
in schools, which enhances issue-centric learning
(see Box 6). An interdisciplinary curriculum is even
more eff ective when it is place based, allowing the
in-depth and authentic study of select local issues
(Stevenson, 1997). ‘In-depth’ means that students
spend a sustained period of time examining and
debating these questions, while ‘authentic’ signifi es
that students, through systematic inquiry, construct
their own meaning and produce knowledge that has
an immediate social value in making a judgment on
a specifi c issue that is real and meaningful to them
(Newmann and Wehlage, 1995). The interconnectivity
between the local and the global should be part of
students’ investigations and discussions in their eff ort
to understand and develop meaningful responses to
local sustainability issues.
As an integral element of improving content and
pedagogy, there is a need to revisit the very nature of
teaching and learning materials used in schools. Today,
information of all sorts is readily available through
information and communication technology (ICT) and
Box 6
Promoting an interdisciplinary approach and
issue-centric learning
Key topics such as ‘globalization of economy and labour’, ‘peace
and confl ict’ or ‘global environmental change’ can hardly be
taught from the perspective of a single school subject. Issuecentric
approaches identify socially relevant real-world issues
with curriculum content to engage students with wider issues
of sustainable development. By posing recognizable real-world
problems for investigation as the central focus of their studies,
learners identify wider social, environmental, economic and
political impacts within the subject-specifi c material for evaluation
and future action. Th is expands opportunities for overcoming
fragmentation of knowledge in the usual silo structure of school
subjects.
An interdisciplinary approach engages students meaningfully
in sustainability issues by allowing them to analyze a complex
topic in more than one subject. Th is can either be achieved by
an individual teacher expanding the contours of the subject area
or by a cross-curricular approach. Instituting a cross-curricular
approach may not be easy in many schools but it has, nevertheless,
been achieved in numerous cases, allowing two or more subjects
to cooperate over a sustained period of time or introducing
project-based learning10 phases in the school calendar. An
interdisciplinary approach, oft en guided by one subject, over a
longer period than a few lessons, fosters ESD key competencies
and enables students to engage in complex issues deeply. Schools
and their teachers need various forms of support to promote
cross-curricular activities: cross-referencing between textbooks of
diff erent subjects, developing supplementary materials focusing
on key ESD issues that can be used across subjects, instituting a
scheme or programme to invite experts to school, curating online
clearing houses on useful interdisciplinary teaching and learning
resources, and so on.

ready-made defi nitions of almost everything students
learn (and do not learn) in school curricula are just a
click away. This opens opportunities for deeper learning
using the rich and easily available data on diverse life
phenomena. At the same time, it gives further support to
the importance of fostering ESD competencies. Today’s
students need not so much to memorize information
as to learn what to do with it – ‘analyse it; make sense
of its abundance and complexity; cooperate with
others to synthesize information; and communicate
the results’ (Laurie et al, 2016, p. 227). Publishers
are increasingly exploring ICT-based teaching and
learning materials to supplement, update or replace
paper-based textbooks. This will not lessen the value
of this guidebook in the years to come. Rather,
developers of content for all educational media can
take cues from this guidebook for creating relevant
and engaging issue-centric content coupled with
student-centred and inquiry-based pedagogical
approaches.
How to embed ESD in textbooks
4.0
Embedding is about enabling students to develop a keen understanding of academic content and to apply their
knowledge and skills to problems not just in the classroom but in their communities, careers and their civic lives.
There is no school subject for which ESD is not relevant. Each subject chapter in this guidebook takes its own
unique approaches to embedding, showing myriad ways through which it can take place. Before presenting
subject-specifi c guidance on embedding in the following chapters, this section provides generic considerations
for embedding ESD in textbooks.
4.1
Developing competencybased
learning units
In recent years, a number of resource materials
have been developed to provide guidance on
integrating ESD and related education into school
curricula (see Box 7), primarily to support curriculum
developers, teacher educators and teachers in their
implementation. Textbook authors may refer to these
materials to check a catalogue of topics and methods
that have been suggested to foster the knowledge,
skills, dispositional and behavioural learning outcomes
called for by ESD and related education.
Whereas calls for 21st century skills or transversal
competencies have increased in recent years (UNESCO,
2015c), competency-based learning is neither
established in all national curricula nor applied equally
in all subjects. Some countries focus on academic
standards, while others concentrate on topics and
learning objectives. Textbook authors will have to
consider diff erent lexicons and conventions in diff erent
educational systems. It is also important to note that the
specifi cation of ESD competencies is just one of many
exercises towards more eff ective ESD implementation.
It is critical to keep in mind that a competency-based
unit will not be optimal until and unless teachers are
properly trained in pedagogies conducive to deeper
learning and adequately supported to create an
environment that allows students to develop these
competencies. Through an embedding approach,
textbook authors can support teachers in their role as
Box 7
UNESCO guidance materials on ESD
Guidance materials on integrating ESD and related education into the school curriculum
abound. Depending on the content they would like to create, textbook authors are encouraged
to refer to resource materials developed by UNESCO to give generic ESD guidance (UNESCO,
2012a, 2012b, 2017a), generic global citizenship education guidance (2015a), technical
guidance on integrating more specifi c topics such as disaster risk reduction (UNICEF and
UNESCO, 2012) and sexuality education (UNESCO, 2009) into the school curriculum, or a
teacher education course on climate change education (UNESCO, 2013). Teaching Respect for
All: Implementation Guide (UNESCO, 2014b) calls for an embedding approach and provides
examples of incorporating concepts of respect and anti-discrimination across subject areas,
including mathematics. Helpful for the approach of developing competency-based learning
units is Education for the Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives (UNESCO,
2017a), which identifi es ESD key competencies and outlines indicative learning objectives,
topics and pedagogical approaches for each of the 17 SDGs.

learning facilitators by incorporating cues for creating
such an environment. Textbooks can be an aid for
teachers to implement ESD in their classrooms while
teaching core academic coursework. The following
sections present how textbook authors can select ESD
themes, topics and issues (4.2) and encourage students
not just to interpret the world but to shape it (4.3).
4.2
Selecting ESD themes,
topics and issues
A broad ESD-related theme, a specifi c topic or an
issue can be adopted as the focus for a curriculum
unit within any subject, and many detailed examples
are off ered in the following chapters. ESD topics can
be wide-ranging, from energy and water use and
responsible consumption to poverty and its alleviation
(see Box 1 for SDGs).
Broad themes that can serve as a cross-curriculum
umbrella may focus on change, complexity, uncertainty
or diversity. The term ‘issue’ is used to refer to any
problem where there is signifi cant disagreement about
the appropriate solution among the people aff ected.
Some school subjects have already started to
include ESD issues and topics, although the content
in mandatory curricula is usually structured in a
systematic way around key concepts of academic
disciplines. This can become a challenge for textbook
authors and publishers, who wish to produce a new
generation of textbooks that integrate ESD. They
have to discover niches in the prescribed curriculum.
Some curricula, however, are less rigid and allow
for the implementation of ESD topics or a thematic
approach (see the Mathematics chapter, section 3.4
and the Science chapter, section 3.1), which relates
curriculum topics to each other and associates them
with ESD issues. This approach allows textbook
authors to emphasize the interconnectedness of
socio-scientifi c issues and to explore the controversies
and complexities of real-world situations. Box 8 lists
some generic criteria that may be helpful in selecting
ESD topics.
The chapters in this guidebook provide subject-specifi c
guidance on how to select ESD topics and connect
them to pedagogical approaches. As the examples
in all four subject chapters discuss in detail how the
integration of content and pedagogy can be achieved
in textbooks, the following section briefl y discusses
considerations for including pedagogical insights
in textbooks.
4.3
Making ESD issues ‘matter’
to students
Education traditionally equips students to understand
and, at best, conceptualize problems but rarely to enact
solutions. This suggests that textbook authors should
provide ideas for structuring student inquiries into
sustainability questions and issues. They should also
encourage student participation by prompting learners
to act on the results of their inquiries.
The aspirations captured in the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development represent broad aims and
ideals that do not directly address the context in which
education and social change take place. ESD principles
will have to be translated into pedagogical practices
that engage students in developing meaningful
understandings and enduring dispositions. Teachers
need to be encouraged and supported to connect the
principles to their students’ local place or community
and lived experience, while also connecting to the
respective infl uences of the ‘global on the local’ and
the ‘local on the global’ (Stevenson, 2007).
The challenge for textbook authors is to create an
environment that engages students intellectually and
emotionally in sustainable development – to make
sustainable development issues and topics ‘matter’ to
students. This section includes advice that pertains to
framing content as well as the use of language and
visuals and writing style when embedding ESD in
textbooks. ESD pedagogies prioritize thinking, valuing
Box 8
Criteria for selecting ESD topics
ESD topics should:
• Be meaningful and signifi cant to the learner (relevant to their real life).
• Be issue based (problem oriented) and explore the possibilities of
sustainable solutions.
• Be linked to one or more SDGs of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development (see Box 1).
• Encourage to investigate and discuss the interconnectivity between
local, national and global issues or development.
• Address the fundamental challenges and tensions facing humanity,
giving particular attention to four challenges identifi ed in UNESCO’s
(2015b) Rethinking Education report (pp. 21–26):
− Ecological stress and unsustainable patterns of economic
production and consumption.
− Greater wealth but rising vulnerability and growing inequalities.
− Growing interconnectedness but rising intolerance
and violence.
− Progress and challenges in fulfi lling human rights.
• Be conducive to fostering selected ESD competencies
(see Box 5), for example:
− Invite a change of perspectives.
− Foster the understanding and appreciation of socio-cultural
diversity.

and acting as fundamental to educational practice
(Reid, 2002). As discussed earlier, ESD should occur
through a range of student-centred and inquiry-based
teaching and learning activities. When these activities
are contextualized using real or authentic examples,
critical thinking, problem solving and active student
participation that emphasizes refl exivity, students
have the opportunity to develop deep environmental,
economic, social and political understandings and the
capacity to enact positive individual and collective
environmental and social change. Although thinking,
valuing and acting are often intertwined, the three
sub-sections that follow will elaborate on some
key pedagogical strategies aimed at fostering (1)
cognitive skills, (2) socio-emotional skills, attitudes or
dispositions and (3) actions. Critical inquiry is central
to all of these broad strategies, although it is discussed
fi rst. These strategies are not intended to be exhaustive
but to be modifi ed and added to as necessary.
Critical inquiry and systems thinking
One way to create an environment conducive to
thinking is to write learning units that allow multiple
and complex answers and engage students in critical
inquiry. It is important to employ an authoring
approach that is not top-down. It needs to allow
students to think critically, to engage with the
content and perceive knowledge as an ongoing
process rather than something fi xed in stone that
cannot be challenged. Critical inquiry is the process of
examining existing assumptions and deconstructing,
reconstructing and constructing knowledge. Inquiry,
critical thinking and integration abilities11 enable a
student to identify a problem, propose solutions, fi nd
evidence for and against proposed solutions, and
evaluate the solutions based on this evidence. Critical
inquiry assists students to examine and challenge the
status quo and deepen their critical understanding of
the issues in the world around them.
Meaningful learning, as opposed to mechanistic
absorption of information, can bring our complex
world alive by making it clearer. Textbook authors
can write content in a way that facilitates openended
instruction, rather than steering students
toward one ‘right’ answer. ESD ‘entails more than
simply knowing things about the environment,
economics, or equity and social justice issues, but
rather involves a willingness and ability to engage
intellectually and personally with the tensions that
are created by the interconnectedness of these
systems’ (Nolet, 2009, p. 421). Often the tensions and
confl icts arising from diff erent values and interests are
missing from what is taught in school. It is important
to engage students – appropriately for their age and
development – in identifying, understanding and
analyzing these confl icts and learning that debate
and negotiation are a part of a democratic political
process. By analyzing these confl icting interests at the
individual, organizational and structural levels, and at
geographical scales from local to global, students learn
not only the root causes of sustainability issues but also
what actions they can take to address them.

schooloft hinq.com for a
broad range of resources for
fostering deep understanding,
inquiry and integration.
28 | INTRODUCTION
Figure 5 can help students analyze these tensions and
confl icts from a holistic perspective and cultivate their
critical and systemic thinking abilities by taking into
account the interconnected environmental, economic,
social and political dimensions of sustainable
development. The graphic is a representation of these
dimensions that highlights the fundamental tensions
between them. This kind of visual model can also be
used in the classroom to help students understand
and develop meaningful responses to sustainable
development issues. The chosen issue can be analyzed
by discussing the tensions and possible sustainable
synergies between the four (coloured) development
dimensions. For more advanced students, the model
can be used to deal with the chosen issue from the
individual to the global level.
Systems thinking is a useful approach to problem
solving that is more eff ective than considering
problems in isolation. Given the complexity of
sustainable development, a model like this can only
provide orientation. Figure 5 cannot, for example,
describe the complexity of human dependence on
the biosphere.
Scientifi c knowledge has been largely gained
by isolating problems into components, but it
has become apparent that many of the complex
problems facing humanity require a more systemic
approach. Embedding ESD should take into
account the challenge of changing the essentially
anthropocentric understanding of the world that
dominates many disciplines and much of the school
curriculum. At the same time, it should rearticulate
the humanistic agenda in education and reclaim
the intrinsic value of education as an experience
that enhances each individual’s capabilities and
freedom. While environmental science classes may
try to develop in students a sense of the severity of
the current ecological crisis and the importance of
conservation practices in response, core subjects may
continue to promote a utilitarian perception of the
environment (the world in which we live) as a bank of
resources for humans to use in the name of progress.
This latter approach is counter to the purpose of
fostering in students an environmental conscience
and stewardship (see Kumar, 2017, and the Science
chapter’s Example 1 on forest communities and
Example 4 on the impact of agricultural practices
on bee populations, which consider how human
relationships with fragile ecosystems may be
approached by authors in core texts). Textbook
authors can highlight the interconnectedness of
biological, physical, social, economic, political and
cultural phenomena and refer to the interdisciplinary
treatment of issues from the holistic perspective
of sustainable development. They can encourage
teachers to go beyond the boundaries of their own
subject matter or discipline and to consciously
incorporate knowledge from other disciplines, while
also establishing both the potential and limits of a
single subject to address sustainability issues.
Embedding ESD should
take into account the
challenge of changing
the essentially
anthropocentric
understanding of
the world, while
reclaiming the intrinsic
value of education
as an experience
that enhances each
individual’s capabilities
and freedom

12 Th ere are widely accepted ‘universal’ values articulated in the Earth Charter (1992), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United
Nations, 2015) and other international documents. Th ese core ‘non-negotiable’ values include: respect for biological and cultural diversity,
democracy, environmental protection, eradication of poverty, gender equality, human rights and a culture of peace and non-violence, among
others. For the list of international human rights instruments, see UNESCO (2017b), pp. 26–27.
13 Th is resource guide was developed for Civic, Social and Political Education (a compulsory subject in the Junior Certifi cate course for the fi rst
three years of secondary education in Ireland) to ensure that Ireland becomes ‘a society where diversity is valued … where interaction between
diverse groups takes place and is underpinned by equality, human rights, mutual respect and understanding’ (Gannon, 2002, p. 5).
Perspective taking and changing
perspectives
One of the important tasks of education is to help
students understand, respect and question values –
their own, the values of the society in which they live
and the values of others around the world. To address
the tenacity of stereotypes and the inability to have
genuine dialogues to overcome confl icts, fi rst and
foremost, it is critically important for textbook authors
to ensure that the content they write is free from harmful
gender, religious and other stereotypes (for general
guidance on making textbook content inclusive, see
UNESCO, 2017b). While many of the identifi ed ESD
competencies are linked to values (see Box 5), ESD is
not about preaching ‘universal’ values to students as
passive recipients.12 Textbook authors should employ
an approach that is not moralistic but allows students
to encounter and engage with diff erence and diversity,
to analyze diff erent perspectives while refl ecting on
their own assumptions, perspectives and values.
Textbook authors can use pedagogic strategies,
such as role-playing and simulations or story-telling
and refl ective writing, to provide an opportunity for
students to cultivate empathy, that is, an in-depth
understanding of another person’s perspective. In
societies dealing with historical trauma, textbook
authors could present discussions between people
in which the processes of stereotyping, fearing and
demonizing the other can be deconstructed and
made more explicit to students. While cognitive
and aff ective perspective-taking can be understood
as an important component skill of empathy, what
is needed is more than a fostering of tolerance
towards and empathy for those who are diff erent or
an ‘openness’ to other perspectives. In our globalizing
world, where students encounter diversity both
virtually and in real life, the notion of ‘changing
perspectives’ (see Box 5) is gaining signifi cance
(Gannon, 2002; Wettstädt and Asbrand, 2013). Going
beyond dominant approaches to multiculturalism,
which focus on fostering empathy with those who are
discriminated against, a range of activities included
in the resource guide Changing Perspectives (Gannon,
2002) challenges students and teachers to delve
into stereotypes and prejudice and the situation of
minority groups in their own society to confront their
own prejudices and broaden their perspectives.13
Some activities engage students and teachers in
disagreement or confl ict around issues they feel
strongly about. They resonate with the ‘pedagogy
of discomfort’, which involves disrupting deeply
rooted understandings of how the world works
(Boler, 1999).
Textbooks can be written in a way that enables
teachers and students to leave their emotional comfort
zones, to discover and acknowledge their own biases
towards diff erent cultures or their own culpability in
ecological or social injustice. They can then come to
realize that they can change an undesirable situation
whereby they have contributed to other people’s pain
or ecological damage. In an age-appropriate and
culturally sensitive manner, learning units can evoke
discomforting emotions – such as irritation, guilt,
shame and anxiety – a valid entry point to examine
and overcome biases and prejudices as well as to
change unsustainable lifestyle choices. Nevertheless, it
must also be noted that such ‘pedagogy of discomfort’
can be too uncomfortable, even for post-graduate
students (Bryan, 2012), and may not be appropriate
for younger students (Zembylas and McGlynn, 2012).
This consideration is especially pertinent when
addressing controversial issues that require students
to acknowledge their own privilege and complicity in
structures of inequality and injustice based on gender,
class, race, ethnicity, geography, caste, sexuality,
religion and more.
Real-world connections
Reorientation of academic content towards ESD should
ideally be accompanied by ‘real-life’ documents and
more expressive language to allow students to connect
with the material being taught. Textbook authors can
include visual and textual representations that are
attractive, diverse and powerful. Furthermore, authors
are encouraged to suggest ideas for student-centred
teaching and learning activities that allow students
to awaken all their senses, make decisions and take
actions that contribute to creating a sustainable
society and ecosystem. For example, textbooks can
include suggestions for linking subject content
to opportunities to engage in community-based
experiential and participatory learning through extracurricular
activities, collaboration with stakeholders
outside of school, excursions and discussions with
experts or on-the-ground projects that deal with
sustainable development issues.
All of these activities can, in turn, be part of ‘projectbased
learning’, which has become one of the preferred
pedagogic strategies in ESD. Project-based learning
aims to go beyond the application of knowledge and
skills to assigned tasks, expanding room for decisionmaking
and responsibility on the part of students
and building their sense of self-effi cacy as active
participants in a given project. Project-based learning
can also be integrated with the activities of a ‘wholeschool
approach’ to ESD (see Box 9).
To address the tenacity
of stereotypes and
the inability to have
genuine dialogues to
overcome confl icts,
fi rst and foremost, it is
critically important for
textbook authors to
ensure that the content
they write is free
from harmful gender,
religious and other
stereotypes
30 | INTRODUCTION
Box 9
Whole-school approach
Formal education has an essential role to play in the
transformation process called for by the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. To empower students
to become change agents, sustainable development
should gradually become the value centre and common
point of reference for all school subjects, structures and
activities. It greatly contributes to student learning when
schools and all their activities are seen as a microcosm
of society that has to become sustainable. In common
with other institutions, schools are facing challenges
such as sustainable facility management, responsible
use of resources, waste management, democratic
participation, appreciation of socio-cultural diversity
and inclusion. In many cases, school is the community
and lifeworld closest to the students.
Apart from the cross-curricular coordination of
various subjects and their alignment with sustainable
development (see Box 6), the orientation of the whole
school towards this principle should fi nd ways into
new textbooks. Th e whole-school approach gains its
strength from a common focus and the coherence of
its elements with the learning process in subjects. For
example, the growing of vegetables in the school garden
can be linked with biology and health education, the
sustainable student enterprise with economics and
school partnerships with language education and
geography. Promoting whole-institution approaches is
a priority action area of the Global Action Programme
on ESD (2015), a follow-up framework of the UN
Decade of ESD (UNESCO, 2014a).

Assessment in alignment
with ESD
Assessment communicates to students what kind
of work is valued. The subject chapters of this
guidebook do not elaborate on assessment and much
work still needs to be done to assess learning in the
domains covered by SDG Target 4.7. This section,
therefore, briefl y discusses what kind of assessment
is aligned with ESD. We suggest a focus on authentic
assessment, which asks students to perform
real-world tasks that demand the application of
complex knowledge and skills to address a problem
or issue – in this case, connected to sustainable
development. Both teaching and assessment
should aim for authentic performance, such as the
construction of knowledge through refl ective inquiry.
This results in ways of thinking and acting that have
value and meaning beyond success in school tests or
exams (Newmann, Secada and Wehlage, 1995).
The pedagogical guidance given in the subject
chapters is often linked to issue-based content and
student-centred teaching and learning activities.
Inquiry-based and action-oriented teaching-learning
processes (see section 4.3) can be supported through
diff erent forms of assessment tasks that could be
introduced into textbooks in connection with the tasks
for a learning unit.
It is widely understood that although ESD is applicable
across all school subjects, monitoring performance
and evaluating assessments may diff er from subject
to subject, and some disciplines may be able to address
ESD more directly than others. The knowledge, skills,
dispositional and behavioural learning outcomes
called for by ESD and related education can be
embedded in the general learning outcomes of a
particular school subject. Assessments in alignment
with ESD may include:
● Tasks that ask students to demonstrate the
development of ESD competencies that include
both written and non-written performance (essays,
reports, debates, presentations, etc).
● Group activities that off er opportunities to
apply ESD competencies to real-world situations
or collaborations with external actors and
organizations (local, national, international).
● Tasks that ask students explicitly to study and
address the relationship between the subject and
sustainable development.
● Role-playing activities that encourage aff ective
learning and the development of empathy and
respect (these could involve written work, videos,
theatrical plays, etc).
● Peer review and self-assessments that ask students
to monitor their learning and refl ect critically on
their progress as well as that of their peers.
● Assessment through interactive dialogue between
the teacher and learner, aided by the use of rubrics
or competency grids.14
Outline of the guidebook
5.0
This chapter has off ered an introduction to embedding ESD into textbooks, presenting the
case for why this is important, necessary and benefi cial, as well as explaining key pedagogical
considerations. The main body of the guidebook is composed of four subject chapters:
MATHEMATICS
SCIENCE
GEOGRAPHY
LANGUAGE
It is important to keep in mind the interrelatedness of these subjects, especially in the context
of ‘issue-based’ learning and the principles and competencies discussed above. Although
each subject is independent in its own right and has a structure that refl ects the specifi cities
and requirements of the subject matter, there is a common thread across these chapters.
Each chapter begins by explaining how the particular subject contributes to ESD. It then
expands on the tools and competencies for each subject by guiding the reader on what
‘ingredients’ and processes are needed to embed ESD in subject content. Finally, the last
section of these chapters includes concrete examples of embedding, which textbook authors
can replicate in their contexts or take inspiration from.

grids for sample units in

competencies in Schreiber

PEOPLE WHO LOVE mathematics celebrate its beauty
and utility. However, many others fear mathematics
and some even say they hate it. The strong feelings
mathematics can arouse stem from people’s
experiences of the subject, especially how they were
taught it in school. The teaching of mathematics
makes a strong impact – it determines what people
consider mathematics to be and it aff ects how they
use (or whether they choose to ignore) its tools.
Mathematics textbooks play a strong role in the
way students think about mathematics and how it
connects to their community concerns. Mathematics
is a necessary part of basic literacy in the 21st century.
This chapter describes the potential of mathematics
for contributing to sustainable living, peace and
global citizenship (see the Introductory chapter for
elaboration on sustainable development, which
is a term intended to include peace and global
citizenship). It outlines how authors of mathematics
textbooks and related resources can design them
to support the development of mathematics’
potential in students while also orienting students
to sustainable development concerns. To embed
education for sustainable development (ESD) into
mathematics textbooks in this way, it is necessary to
ensure students see mathematics as a way of thinking
developed by humans to address their concerns in
particular contexts. It is important to recognize that
mathematical tools are developed to address local
challenges or concerns. Mathematical tools that are
developed in response to particular concerns may be
applied to challenges in diff erent contexts, although
such applications may have limitations.
This chapter encourages the development of
mathematics textbooks that promote the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). It considers human
challenges addressed by mathematics, and thus
describes how mathematics is a human activity that
can support aspirations for sustainable development.
Next, the chapter outlines advice and support for
textbook authors with an interest in ESD. The chapter
closes with examples of text and discusses how
these examples connect to the guidance given in
this chapter. Strong connections to particular SDGs
will be identifi ed in brackets with reference to the
specifi c SDGs developed by the United Nations,
for example, this chapter is intended as a resource
for partnerships for ESD (SDG 17). Similarly, strong
connections to the ESD competencies outlined in
the Introductory chapter are referred to in brackets.
Everything in the chapter connects in multiple ways
to ESD competencies and SDGs, but only the strong
connections are identifi ed to keep these orienting
principles and goals in mind.

Potential contributions of
mathematics to ESD
2.0
2.1
Mathematical processes
Mathematics can be understood (philosophized)
in varying ways. With an interest in embedding
ESD, it is important to think of mathematics as a
human activity, as a way of addressing challenges
in particular human contexts. With more ‘formalist’
views of mathematics, it would be diffi cult to embed
ESD in textbooks because ESD expects students to
develop knowledge and skill in relationship with
their communities and environment. Mathematician
Reuben Hersh describes well how mathematics is, in
fact, a human activity (Hersh, 1997).
Understanding mathematics as a human activity
makes it possible to think about how it can either
support or undermine sustainable development.
Alan Bishop (1988) described six categories of human
activity for examining cultural practices to identify
mathematics. Mathematics is counting, measuring
and locating. When people design, explain or play
with counting, measuring or locating, they are doing
mathematics. For millennia, people in every culture
have described objects in terms of their quantities,
their sizes and their location. These mathematical
actions – counting, measuring and locating –
indicate clear connections between people and their
environments. For example, people often count days
and keep records of events to predict a good time to
plant crops, to organize gatherings, etc. Calendars
are used for this. It is likewise a common practice to
measure parts of a person’s body to make clothing
that fi ts. As an example of location (geometry)
practices, people identify landmarks and use words
and numbers in relation to these landmarks to
remember how to fi nd a specifi c place or direct
others to that place. With this kind of mathematical
activity, people are designing ways to meet their
needs in effi cient ways. This is a way of saying that
mathematics is a tool for sustainable development.
2.2
Generalization and
abstraction
Mathematics also includes generalized tools that
are used in these endeavours but these tools are not
as clearly associated with their environments. For
example, we may notice that three mangos grouped
with fi ve similar mangos forms a group of eight
mangos. Because this is true for other kinds of objects
as well, we say 3 + 5 = 8. Always. The expression 3 +
5 = 8 is an abstraction because it is not connected
to any particular context. For an example involving
measurement and location, people have noticed that
a triangle with sides measuring 3, 4, and 5 always has
a right angle, no matter what unit of measure is used.
This generalization has been used for millennia in the
construction of buildings that meet human needs
with effi ciency.
Most uses of applied mathematics draw on
generalizations. For example, when designating
boundaries for elections, populations are counted
in regions but the counting is complex because
people are ageing (coming of age to vote), dying and
relocating, and the numbers are high. To deal with this
complexity, designers use algorithms for computation
and identify patterns to make predictions of future
populations. These computational tools and models
for describing pattern are abstractions. The same
process involves decisions about shape and space
because the designers need to construct boundaries
that make sense to people. For this, they draw on
geometric objects that are well known, for example,
straight lines and smooth curves, all of which are
abstractions.
Abstractions like this are powerful tools for the
deeper evaluation of human challenges because
they allow us to make predictions and to design
physical and conceptual structures that meet our
needs and desires. The sustainable development
framework developed by the United Nations
balances immediate needs with long-term and
societal needs. In other words, an individual’s
need for clean water (SDGs 6 and 14), healthy food
(SDGs 2, 3, 14 and 15) and meaningful work (SDG
8) is ideally balanced with others’ current needs
for these things (SDGs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 10), as well
as the long-term availability of resources to meet
people’s needs in the future (i.e. sustainability).
Mathematics can help us to negotiate such
balances, although such endeavours are never
straightforward.
Understanding
mathematics as
a human activity
makes it possible to
think about how it
can either support or
undermine sustainable
development
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 39
2.3
A tool for complex systems
To balance confl icting needs (see Figure 1), decisionmakers
consider various measures that indicate the
attainment of identifi ed goals and assign numeric
values to things that are not straightforward to
measure. These values can be weighted according
to the value assigned to each goal. These measured
and weighted indicators can be used in various
policy scenarios that may be imagined to identify an
optimum decision. Of course, this all depends on the
quality of the decision-makers’ choices about what to
measure and which measures to value the most, and
it depends on the quality of the mathematical model
for predicting results that connect with prospective
decisions. All these decisions may make such
endeavours seem rather arbitrary, but alternative
approaches to such decisions are no less arbitrary.
It is common practice for national and jurisdictional
leaders to evaluate decisions based on GDP (gross
domestic product) – the idea is that when material
wealth is maximized, people prosper. It is worth
considering alternatives because, for example, GDP
can rise even when the poorest people remain
impoverished. Furthermore, there are other concerns
in addition to material wealth. Some alternative
measures for decision-making include:
● Developing one’s own measure that foregrounds
certain concerns, for example, one could instead
measure the wealth of the poorest quartile, access
to meaningful work, quality food, etc.
● The Gini index has been developed to measure the
distribution of wealth in a nation or region (http://
hdr.undp.org/en/content/income-gini-coeffi cient).
● The country of Bhutan requires policy initiatives to
be justifi ed on the basis of gross national happiness
instead of GDP (http://www.grossnationalhappiness.
com).
Mathematical actions
– counting, measuring
and locating –
indicate clear
connections between
people and their
environments.
Through this kind of
mathematical activity,
people design ways to
meet their needs in
effi cient ways. This is
a way of saying that
mathematics is a
tool for sustainable
development

● The United Nations tries to measure a range
of important indicators in its reporting on
developments in nations. The organization has
developed a resource on Indicators of Sustainable
Development and relevant guidelines and
methodologies (http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/
natlinfo/indicators/guidelines.pdf). Further to this,
the Inclusive Wealth Report (UNU-IHDP and UNEP,
2014) gives a comprehensive analysis of a range
of indicators, including a discussion about how
these are interrelated, in its comparison of nations.
It includes the disaggregation of wealth data on
the basis of racial or ethnic categories, gender,
religion, age and geography. This data is useful for
social movements that promote the elimination of
disparities and inequalities (http://mgiep.unesco.
org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IWR2014-
WEB.pdf ).
The identifi cation of measures, attribution of values
and design of predictive models makes discussion of
these important human decisions explicit. This kind
of discussion is necessary to enable engaged citizens
to make good decisions both locally and globally.
Ideally, the involvement of a wide base of citizens
in such discussion would support the strongest
decisions. For this to happen, students need to learn
to use mathematics in these potentially powerful and
compassionate ways. Not all children and students
become mathematicians but we have to prepare
them to use mathematics in the world.
Mathematics also provides tools for decision-making
at a local level or focused on particular issues. For
example, we can use demographic distinctions such
as age, gender, ethnicity, immigration/refugee status,
religion, sexual identity or socio-economic categories
to count and compare populations of people in
prison, executive positions, government leadership,
teaching positions, etc. These comparisons allow
us to identify inequities and thus enable the design
of programmes to address the inequities. Typically,
programmes that aim to redress inequities rely on
mathematical tools in their implementation as well.
Number systems make the precise and accurate
communication of quantities possible. (It should be
noted that precision and accuracy are often taken
as relatively synonymous but they have distinct
and clear meanings in science.) As far as we know,
every culture has developed language to describe
number, including both precise number words and
words that describe broader categories of quantity,
such as few, some, many or most. Symbolic systems
make it possible to work with quantities that defy
human understanding. A strong example of this
is place-value notation, which allows accurate
and precise calculations far beyond amounts we
can visualize (beyond our abilities to visualize at a
large or microscopic scale). Language for precision
goes beyond counting numbers to include partial
amounts, represented by fractions and decimals,
and extending into more imaginary values, such as
negative and complex numbers. Similarly, cultures
have developed precise and imprecise standards
for measuring objects. For example, a stretch of
garment may be measured with hand spans, which
vary slightly from one measurement to another but
such measurements can be made without precise
tools. Or the same garment may be measured
with centimetres, which are based on an accepted
standard recognized across borders, providing a basis
for accuracy because the measures would not vary
signifi cantly. These systems – number and operation
systems, symbols to represent them and measuring
systems – are examples of human ingenuity addressing
community needs and are, therefore, important to
people who want mathematics to be seen as a way of
addressing sustainable development values.
These powerful advances in mathematics allow
humans to communicate with precision and accuracy,
without ambiguity and with relative brevity. There
are signifi cant social implications for such clear
communication. Justice and peace (SDG 16) require
the possibility of trade and agreements with clear
standards and measurements. For example, the
price charged for wheat should not depend on the
customer’s skin colour or their relationship with the
vendor (SDGs 5 and 10). With standard measures of
mass and grain quality, it is possible to enforce the
avoidance of discrimination in grain sales. For an
example at a global scale, if countries are to agree on
greenhouse gas emission reductions (SDGs 13–15),
they need precise ways of measuring the time spans
involved as well as the quantities and qualities of
those emissions.
Mathematics provides
tools for decision
making. We can
use demographic
distinctions to
count and compare
populations, which
allows us to identify
inequities and thus
enable the design
of programmes
to address them
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 41
Proof and justifi cation are often thought of as
important reasons for learning mathematics. In the
social situations described above – trade, treaties
and other agreements – the need for proof and
justifi cation becomes very clear. People must justify
their adherence to standards. They do so using
the number and measurement systems described
above, and they also use an approach to reasoning
associated with mathematical proof – the expectation
that each statement is justifi ed. History tells us that
quantifi cation is associated with the development
of democracies and other forms of community
responsibility (Porter, 1995): when decision-makers
are not identifi ed through heredity or connection to
deities, they must prove that their decisions are made
in the interests of the collective good. Mathematics
gives citizens the tools to obtain this kind of proof.
Human aspirations, such as reducing greenhouse
gas emissions or exploiting a natural resource
(an aspiration that often confl icts with reduced
emissions), are typically described with mathematical
notation with the goal of engineering an optimal
result (ESD competency – facing the future). Such
‘mathematical modelling’ allows people to play with
diff erent structures and designs to maximize whatever
they aspire to – effi ciency, safety, biodiversity,
predictability, etc. For example, when countries set
emissions targets, their specialists use mathematical
models to predict the kind of energy effi ciencies that
will become possible, the level of public support for
such structural change, the impact on economies
and more. All these factors are interconnected, which
makes this a complex system (ESD competency –
dealing with systems). But mathematical models are
used on local scales as well. For example, farmers
reduce waste and maximize their profi ts if they can
successfully predict how much corn they will sell on
market day. With accurate modelling, they can plant,
pick and transport the ideal amounts of corn.
2.4
Limitations
Any tool has limitations. For example, although it may
be possible to quantify and thus measure aspects of
love, fear, pain, hunger and other realities of human
experience, it is wise to question the appropriateness
of applying mathematical tools in any given
situation. Furthermore, even if mathematical tools
are deemed appropriate, it is necessary to remember
that there are risks in using any tool. For example,
mathematical tools are used to design technologies
of violence – bombs, eugenics programmes (in which
discrimination is explicitly related to measurement
of human characteristics, such as intelligence, skin
colour), etc. Even when people aim to do good
with their mathematics, there are risks. It is worth
remembering that politicians who have advocated
bombings and eugenics programmes often seemed
to think they were doing the right thing. It is worth
refl ecting on our own conception of good and how it
might have unintended negative implications.
As we move conceptually and physically from local
and specifi c contexts, we pay attention to certain
aspects and lose connection to others. Abstraction
is part of this process and is an important part of
mathematics. For example, farmers know a lot
about the needs and capabilities of their cattle.
Mathematical tools make it possible for farmers to
scale up their farming to increase productivity and
effi ciency (SDG 2) which, in turn, causes them to lose
their connection to the cattle. The trade in livestock
and beef is a step further removed from the cattle,
and investment specialists are even more distant.
People who have never touched a live cow or bull are
making decisions about cattle – decisions that aff ect
the quality of the lives of the cattle and, in turn, the
qualities of the meat and milk consumed by humans
(SDG 3). These decisions aff ect who lives and who dies
(SDG 10). The power of large-scale decisions made on
the basis of numeric data must be balanced against
the danger of decision-makers not understanding
the environments they are controlling. We need
to be careful about making claims of progress and
development because sometimes steps that appear
to improve lives in the short term have negative
consequences that we might not predict.

2.5
Beauty
Mathematics as described above – including
its language, notation and operations – is often
seen as an important part of humanity’s cultural
achievement. In some ways it is a cross-cultural
achievement because there are mathematical ideas
and procedures that are shared across cultures. Yet
there are unique mathematical ideas that address
local cultures and contexts as well. For example, a
boat-building family may develop unique procedures
for measuring and cutting wood in a way that
responds to the particular tree characteristics of their
region. These unique forms of mathematics are also
signifi cant aspects of cultural achievement.
Considering these cultural achievements – in both
cross-cultural and more culturally specifi c situations
– mathematics is worth studying in a similar way to
the arts. There is beauty in this human endeavour
and appreciation of this beauty may help us respect
the needs of people who are diff erent from us
(SDGs 10 and 16). Mathematics opens our eyes to
symmetry and patterns that have aesthetic value
beyond the practical aspects described above. These
aesthetics may be appreciated even with a formalist
view of mathematics in which the human role is not
acknowledged. However, identifying the human
role in these aesthetics makes mathematics an even
more powerful force for peace. Many educators
claim that the inclusion of aesthetics in education
increases harmony – when people stand beside each
other to enjoy something beautiful, they become as
one through the shared experience.
While peace and harmony are themselves a goal
for sustainable development (SDG 16), conflict on
a small or large scale (war, for example) endangers
all the other goals for sustainability identified by
the United Nations. War destroys environments.
Any level of conflict undermines equality and
some people’s access to safe food, clean water and
meaningful employment.
For a society with engaged citizens, it is
very important that every child learns basic
mathematics and is given the opportunity to learn
more advanced mathematics (SDG 4). Mathematics
gives people power to trump status with reason.
It allows humans to organize themselves to trade
fairly in local and global economies. By giving
us comparison tools (statistics, for instance), it
can be used to convince people of injustices and
prejudices and to measure the effects of actions
to address these issues. If children are taught that
mathematics has only one correct approach in any
situation, and they are not taught to reason with
mathematics, others who are mathematically savvy
will be able to convince the public of ideas that
may be selfish or otherwise dangerous.
Mathematics opens
our eyes to symmetry
and patterns that
have aesthetic
value beyond their
practical aspects

3.1
Avoiding simplifi cation
It is important to support the development of basic
skills that students can then use for more complex
actions. Necessary basic skills include those from other
disciplines – most notably language skills relating to
oral and written communication. The necessary skills
also include basic mathematics, such as counting,
measuring, addition, pattern recognition, graphing,
etc. For example, it is important for children to be
able to add and subtract numbers in order to work
together to survey their school population’s views on
a community issue.
Although it is important to learn basic skills,
educators often use this as an excuse for teaching
mathematics only in its abstraction or with oversimplifi
ed contexts. This approach develops the idea
that there is only one right answer to any question
involving mathematics and that context does not
matter. By contrast, ESD favours engagement with
community issues. Mathematician Johan Galtung has
written extensively about peace and remarks on the
inadequacies of stereotypical mathematical thinking:
mathematics disciplines us into a particular mode
of thought highly compatible with black-white
thinking and polarization in personal, social
and world spaces. The either-or character of
mathematical thought makes it an exciting game:
but as a model for a highly dialectic human, social
and world reality it is far from adequate.
(Galtung, 1990, p. 301)
For an example of abstracted mathematics, students
are often taught to add numbers using blocks or
simple diagrams. After learning what addition means,
they complete exercises to practise the skills, and
eventually apply this skill to contexts that suggest
one right answer. However, addition and even
counting, which is fundamental to addition, are not
always so straightforward in real life. An important
aspect of ESD is to connect all learning with students’
contexts.
For example, if one counts the number of voters in
two communities, the sum would have only one
answer but there may be questions about who
counts as a voter. This kind of question has obvious
interdisciplinary potential. This interdisciplinarity
does not water down the mathematics. It makes
the mathematics more meaningful by connecting
the mathematical ideas to students’ experiences –
structuring their play, helping with cooking, living
in certain conditions, hearing their family members
talk about concerns, etc. For another example, if a
textbook asks students to fi nd the ratio of students to
teachers in their school, they would have to count the
students in the school and the teachers. They could
add the number of children in a mathematics class,
the number in a language arts class, and so on, but
they would have to be careful to not count the same
child twice or to miss absent children. Furthermore,
counting the teachers is complicated because
decisions would be necessary about who counts as a
teacher. Does the head teacher or principal count, for
example, or an education assistant?
The mathematics pedagogy pattern of starting with
an example that explains a concept and practising
with abstract exercises is common even in highlevel
mathematics classes. Because this approach
uses relatively simplistic scenarios, and because the
pattern repeats through a child’s education, it is no
surprise that a common view of mathematics is that
there is only one correct answer. If mathematics
is to support engaged citizenship and develop an
understanding of the complex systems related
to sustainability (ESD competency – dealing with
systems), then it is important to use real and complex
contexts for the teaching of mathematics at every
level. The rest of this section describes how this can
be supported by mathematics textbooks.
3.2
Word problems versus
rich contexts
Typical mathematics textbooks feature exercises,
example problems and investigations. The exercises
usually involve practising a skill, either in abstract
form or in application to a context – a ‘word problem’.
The examples are usually tasks1 similar to the ones
given in the exercises but with worked-out solutions.
Investigations are more open ended in that methods
for addressing the problem successfully could vary
and no obvious method is available. Perhaps the most
obvious way to embed ESD outcomes in mathematics
Tools and principles for ESD
curriculum development
This section focuses on the kinds of mathematics-based classroom activity that can contribute to peace and
sustainability. In particular, it gives suggestions and guidance to mathematics textbook authors who wish to
support ESD.
3.0
If mathematics
is to support
engaged citizenship
and develop an
understanding
of the complex
systems related to
sustainability, then
students need to work
with real and complex
contexts at every level
1 Mathematics textbooks are
typically designed to provide
information and prompts for
action. Prompts for action are
usually called mathematics
questions but they are not
always questions. Sometimes
they are instructions. So this
chapter will sometimes call
them mathematical tasks.

resources would be to replace the word-problem
contexts in exercises with contexts that relate to
these concerns. These replacements could be done
in examples, exercises or investigations. However,
this kind of replacement may not do justice to
complex situations described in the word problems,
as explained below.
Let us consider universal principles for sustainability
in relation to mathematics problems in learning
resources. First, by defi nition, systems thinking
places any problem in complex interaction with
other problems and contexts. This relates to the ESD
competencies identifi ed in the Introductory chapter
– dealing with systems and solving issues/problems/
confl icts. Most mathematical word problems do
the opposite of promoting systems thinking. This
is because they simplify contexts and encourage
students to ignore even some of the aspects
mentioned in the simplifi ed scenario.
For example, if the question asks how many fence
posts are needed to enclose a rectangular fi eld with
given dimensions, students are typically discouraged
from thinking about real fi elds and real fence posts.
The posts are to be thought of as points (having no
width themselves). The fence is to follow exactly
the outside boundary of the property, although
real fences usually give some space outside the
fence before a roadway, for example. The question
is not really about fence posts at all. The context is a
throwaway one (Gerofsky, 1996). In this way, it would
not be benefi cial to replace such contexts with deep
social concerns because we do not want to train
children to ignore those social concerns. We do not
want children to see the social issues as throwaway
contexts. We do want school mathematics to address
social issues but to do so in meaningful ways.
One approach to this typical characteristic of wordproblem
thinking would be to identify the wordproblem
contexts as simplifi ed and to include
questions that ask students to identify factors that
would have to be considered in the real situation.
This kind of question would also help students
understand how mathematics is an imperfect but
useful tool for addressing problems. A more powerful
approach is to use problems that engage with social
and environmental issues in more complex ways.
An even deeper way of introducing systems thinking
is to replace the orienting expectations in a textbook.
Instead of structuring the book around simplistic
concepts, such as addition or fractions, the books
could be structured around complex issues, such
as organizing and sharing. Many mathematics
textbooks are structured around procedures that
are usually curriculum outcomes. For example, a
lesson might introduce fractions, followed by other
lessons on equivalent fractions, comparing fractions,
addition and subtraction of fractions and, perhaps,
multiplying and dividing fractions, in which case
the procedure is foregrounded even if some of the
exercises or examples have social or environmental
concerns as contexts.
An alternative textbook structure could be arranged
around fundamental processes. If the textbook is
structured around processes – such as organizing and
comparing, modelling and predicting, measuring,
representing and developing procedures – then it will
be important to emphasize with each context how
people are using the process to address the concerns
in the context. A second alternative to the simplistic
procedural orientation would be to organize the
textbook around contexts. Section 3.4 below gives
more guidance on this. Such an approach would
require the contexts to be developed carefully to
ensure coverage of the whole curriculum (assuming
that it is a traditional curriculum, oriented around
procedures).
A deep way to
introduce systems
thinking is to
organize textbooks
around complex
issues rather than
simplistic concepts
Textbook structures
Oriented around procedures
Th is is the most traditional textbook
structure. It foregrounds abstraction
and risks students seeing ESD contexts
as throwaway concerns in word
problems. However, ESD contexts
may be eff ective in the hands of an
ESD-minded teacher.
Oriented around fundamental
processes
Th is approach foregrounds human
approaches to addressing problems
and challenges, and highlights
mathematical disciplinary practices
(organizing, comparing, modelling,
predicting, measuring, representing,
designing algorithms, generalizing,
etc). ESD-context problems would be
seen in the light of these processes.
Oriented around contexts
Th is approach foregrounds community
and environmental concerns and
would feature text that describes
mathematical processes and
procedures as arising out of
such concerns.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 45
3.3
Critical thinking
It is a universal principle of ESD to develop critical
thinking. Mathematics is a strong tool for identifying
injustice, especially systemic injustices. For example,
usually one does not need mathematics to identify
racism in a particular interaction because it is
identifi able in the language and actions of the people
involved. However, we can use mathematics to chart
patterns of interaction, which make it possible to
identify racism in the system. As an example of
systemic racism, one minority person in prison is
not an indication of racism but a disproportionate
number of minority prisoners can point to a system
problem (see Table 1).
Maths resources can prompt students to compare
proportions along race, gender, socio-economic or
other lines in such things as wealth distribution, access
to education, taxation, etc. For example, Eric Gutstein
(2009) described how he had a class compare the
demographics of juries to expose injustices. Ideally,
these prompts for action would engage students in
mapping the characteristics of their own community
and thus engage critically with its problems
and challenges. The students’ participation (ESD
competency – participating and collaborating) would
show how mathematics is relevant to real problems
in their communities and would enable students to
understand complex mathematics because it relates
to situations they know well. Another possibility
is to engage in mathematics done within social
movements. A textbook may ask students to verify the
mathematical and statistical claims made by social or
other organizations, or to engage in collective datagathering
to track phenomena across contexts.
Critical engagement, as described above, requires
collaborative classroom environments. Real
community problems are by nature complex, which
means that students will be making choices about
what to count or measure and what to compare.
Diff erent students will make diff erent choices and
so will benefi t from comparing their approaches,
which will require further mathematical work. When
they collaborate in this way, they will understand
better why multiple points of view are necessary for
addressing problems (ESD competency – thinking
and acting inclusively) and their discussion about
points of view is likely to help them understand
even their own choices and the mathematics they
used. Collaboration also supports the development
of student agency, that is, their sense that they can
make choices about what to do and how to do it. It is
important for students to develop agency so they can
be engaged citizens. In other words, once students
start to use mathematics in school to make sense of
their world, they will gain the confi dence to do this
beyond school.
The interconnections between mathematics and
community concerns are described in some detail by
Eric Gutstein (2007). He uses three words beginning
with the letter C – community, critical and classical –
to help us remember what sort of knowledge should
be developed for mathematics oriented around ESD.
Community knowledge refers to things students
already know. Students bring much knowledge to
school, including knowledge of the cultures with
Systemic problems exist in every country. These problems may
refl ect issues in the justice system, access to education, access to
safe and healthy food and water, or any number of things. This
chart exemplifi es systemic problems in the USA. The mathematics
of the comparison is relatively straightforward. Considering the
relationships among the reasons for the disparity involves more
advanced mathematics and community knowledge. With or
without that deeper knowledge, the mathematics makes it clear
that there is a problem. Deeper knowledge of the situations and
of mathematics can help people understand the problem.

from simple comparison with basic operations to dynamic system modelling.

which they identify and about local features and
interactions. Unfortunately, schools too often ignore
this knowledge. Classical knowledge refers to the
things that schools typically foreground, including
mathematical abstract, conceptual and procedural
knowledge. Critical knowledge refers to awareness
of socio-political conditions. This may well be the
knowledge that is most rare in schools.
Figure 3: Integrated knowledge systems
3.4
Engagement with issues
We encourage textbook authors to be fi rst and
foremost practitioners of the ESD competencies
outlined in the Introductory chapter (see Box 5). This
is best done to support engagement with the issues
of one’s own community as well as those of others.
This engagement should be supplemented with
refl ection on mathematics’ role in forming issues and
challenges. This may include its fundamental role in
structuring scientifi c and technological approaches
to community challenges.
For example, when considering the way mathematics
might be used to address disaster relief or avoidance,
it is worth asking whether mathematics and the
technology it supported brought a disaster upon a
community. Example 4 in section 4.4 below features
mathematics that analyzes aspects of land, sea and
air in relation to a typhoon disaster. It would be wrong
to blame this particular typhoon on any particular
human action but we know that unpredictable
and wild weather is increasing as a result of human
technologies that have spurred on climate change.
In order to embed ESD eff ectively, a textbook author
should:
● Observe and analyze issues and challenges in a
community.
● Research to understand the complex systems at
play and to identify reliable data that can represent
some of the factors at play.
● Refl ect on the larger context and the role of
mathematics (and also science and technology
because they rely on mathematics) in forming the
issues and challenges.
● Identify the mathematics involved in this
engagement with community issues and crossreference
this with the curriculum expectations/
outcomes that need to be addressed in the
materials being developed.
The chart opposite suggests possible starting points
for investigating social and sustainability issues with
mathematics. Clearly, there would be many other
possible starting points and sample topics for each
starting point. For example, a UNESCO publication
called Teaching Respect for All: Implementation
Guide (UNESCO, 2014) has a list of contexts ripe for
teaching respect to all (pp. 164–165). The chart
opposite focuses on relatively large-scale issues but
the same issues and others will be important at local
levels. Obviously, this chapter cannot address local
issues because they are unique to the communities
addressed by particular textbook authors.

knowledge
Educating for sustainable development brings together
community, critical and classical knowledge (Gutstein 2007).
Each of these need to be addressed but, most importantly,
they need to be developed in relation with each other.

are not included. For these, it will be necessary to
work backwards and search for applications of the
mathematics to identify other possible community
and environmental contexts that could be addressed
to develop the mathematical outcomes. Organizing
a textbook to address the complete curriculum will
require going both ways – from issues to curriculum
and vice-versa.

Helpful resources
Textbook authors can improve their engagement
with issues by reading other publications that
engage with community issues. We provide some
examples in the last section of this chapter but more
can be found in publications that describe teaching
practices and publications that are designed as
classroom resources. Many of the resources described
below give great detail on the development of the
community issue for mathematics classrooms. These
examples may help textbook authors develop other
contexts for school mathematics.
David Stocker’s (2006) book Maththatmatters: a
Teacher Resource Linking Math and Social Justice has
many mathematically rich prompts that focus on
critical social issues. The book is a collection of tasks
that he has developed in his teaching practice at the
middle-school level. There is also a second edition
with all new tasks, Maththatmatters 2 (Stocker,
2017). Other publications have fewer examples but
greater discussion. Stocker’s book does not have
such discussion. Most of the resources exemplifying
teaching for social justice feature work with middleand
high-school students but there are some
examples from younger contexts. Beatriz D’Ambrosio
and Celi Espasandin Lopes (2015) provide an example
involving very young children.
As far as we know, the fi rst comprehensive resource
for mathematics education that critically engages
with community issues is Marilyn Frankenstein’s
1989 book Relearning Mathematics: a Diff erent Third
R – Radical Maths. Eric (Rico) Gutstein’s more recent
work follows the vein of Frankenstein’s quite closely
(especially his 2006 book Reading and Writing the
World with Mathematics). He edited a book with Bob
Peterson, Rethinking Mathematics: Teaching Social
Justice by the Numbers, that features examples from
diff erent contributors (Gutstein and Peterson, 2005).
In addition to doing scholarly research, Gutstein
regularly teaches in a local high school (in Chicago)
and presents at conferences examples from this
teaching.
There are other collections of developed examples
of mathematics teaching that engages social and
environmental issues. A recent collection focuses
on environmental issues but also includes social
ones: Teaching Secondary Mathematics as if the Planet
Matters (Coles, Barwell, Cotton, Winter and Brown,
2013). There are a few editions published by the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics that
address gender issues (Secada 2001), cultural issues
(Secada, 2000) and issues relating to indigenous
peoples (Secada, Hankes and Fast, 2002). A more
scholarly collection edited by Brian Greer, Swapna
Mukhopadhyay, Arthur Powell and Sharon Nelson-
Barber (2009) positions engagement with social
issues as cultural responsiveness.
More examples with discussion can be found
interspersed in journal articles and conference
proceedings. The examples referred to in this
chapter are in English because it is the language of
this guidebook and most scholarship is published in
English. However, there is signifi cant work in other
languages. For example, this guidebook is largely
inspired by work carried out in Germany, notably
a mathematics chapter by Antonius Warmeling in
Curriculum Framework: Education for Sustainable
Development (2006).
Other resources focus more generally on the ideas
relating to social justice in mathematics education,
rather than providing examples of how to do it.
Some chapters in the Greer, Mukhopadhyay, Powell
and Nelson-Barber book listed above also fi t this
description. Ubiritan D’Ambrosio was one of the
fi rst mathematics educators to refl ect deeply on
how mathematics relates to social justice and to
write about cultural diversity in mathematics. He has
published mostly in Portuguese but has also engaged
with English speakers. The chapter entitled ‘Cultural
framing of mathematics teaching and learning’
(D’Ambrosio, 1994) is one of his earlier refl ections
and a later chapter, ‘A nonkilling mathematics?’
(D’Ambrosio, 2011), draws on his years of work. It is
possible to watch D’Ambrosio speak about his work
on the Mathematics Education and Society website,
which also features talks recorded in 2015 by Bob
Peterson, Munir Fasheh and Anita Rampal in which
they discuss ethical mathematical teaching (http://
mescommunity.info).
These resources focus attention on the kinds of
problems that are used to engage mathematics
students and prompt refl ection on how these
problems relate to equity concerns. There is also a
large body of research on the nature of interaction
in mathematics classrooms. This underscores the
value of students interacting with each other and
the importance of their engagement in open-ended
problems. These forms of communication help
students develop as engaged citizens, as noted
above. Some of the research shows that this kind
of interaction in mathematics classrooms develops
improved performance on procedural mathematical
outcomes and some of the research focuses on the
way this interaction supports equity. A book chapter
by David Wagner (2011) explains why these are related
to each other, and the work of Jo Boaler is best known
for showing that these two outcomes correlate.
Her article entitled ‘How a detracked mathematics
approach promoted respect, responsibility and
high achievement’ (Boaler, 2006) provides a good
introduction to her work and her website has more
resources (www.youcubed.org). (See also sections

elaboration on teaching and learning methods that

Guidelines for embedding ESD in mathematics textbooks
● Real contexts
Use real mathematical contexts (as opposed to
imaginary contexts or abstractions) to support
the message that mathematics is a useful tool for
addressing human physical needs in sustainable
ways (especially related to SDGs 6–9 and 11–15).
(See considerations for curriculum authors 1A, 2C, 3C.)
● Current issues
Acknowledge that any real context may soon feel
out of date or may not be particularly relevant
to certain students. Textbooks may position real
contexts as examples of people addressing their
current and local issues. This can inspire students
to consider how mathematics may be a useful tool
for sustainable development in their own contexts.
(See considerations for curriculum authors 3E, 5A.)
● Complexity
Do not oversimplify contexts. Such oversimplifi cation
may suggest that the mathematical abstractions are
more important than the contexts they were invented
to address, or that mathematics cannot handle real
complexity. As noted above, there are limitations to
how mathematics can be used in a real context but it
is important for textbooks to pursue the complexity
as appropriate. (See considerations for curriculum
authors 2F, 4A and ESD competency in the Introductory
chapter – dealing with systems.)
● Values
Acknowledge the values behind choices for examples
and contexts. Any choice of context suggests that
the topic is an important one for students. There are
politics involved in making such a choice because
other issues may be more important to the students.
(See considerations for curriculum authors 5B and
ESD competency in the Introductory chapter – refl ecting
on values.)
● Access to data
Cite sources for data used in curriculum resources
and point to other possible sources for further
investigation. When students access publicly available
data, they develop the skills and confi dence for
doing this when they face sustainability challenges
outside school. (See considerations for curriculum
authors 1B.)
● Human activity
Draw attention to people using mathematics to
address social issues with sustainable development
sensibilities. Attention to such human agency can
appear in exercises, investigations, worked examples
or asides. Be sure to identify people from diverse
demographic groups (especially marginalized
ones) so students can visualize themselves using
mathematics powerfully (SDG 4). (See considerations
for curriculum authors 1E, 2C, 2E, 3A, 4C.)
● Foregrounding context
Foreground the context of mathematical work.
Textbooks may be organized around contexts
or around mathematical concepts or processes.
Foregrounding contexts draws attention to sociocultural
concerns and allows connections to develop
between diff erent areas of mathematics. (See
considerations for curriculum authors 2A.)
● Interdisciplinarity
Consider connections to other school subjects. Any
mathematical lesson that uses a context relating
In summary, it is important for mathematics textbooks to show examples of how mathematics can be used
to support SDGs, including disaster risk reduction. In addition to examples that help students to visualize
injustice and unsustainable practices, examples of disasters – when people’s best eff orts go horribly wrong –
help students to plan ways to address these challenges. It is also important to write the materials in a way that
expects and instructs the students to interact with each other to solve complex problems. This teaches them
to listen to other people, develop respect for other’s viewpoints and to make mathematical choices that most
responsibly address the complex problems our communities face.
We outline below 15 guidelines for creating mathematics curriculum resources that support ESD. These are
developed more fully in the examples in the next fi ve sections of this chapter. In fact, this list of 15 guidelines
comes from our work on developing those examples. Our approach to developing the guidelines is an example
of the intimate relationship between abstractions, such as the guidelines below, and considerations in particular
situations, as described in the development of the examples in the next fi ve sections. Mathematics teaching and
curriculum resources should maintain close connections between the abstractions and particular examples in
a similar way.
The last fi ve sections of this chapter provide examples that might be used in mathematics classroom resource
materials. Each example includes a discussion of the issues facing authors wanting to embed sustainability,
peace and global citizenship into their materials, and off ers guidance on how to handle those issues.

to peace or sustainable development is ripe for
cross-curricular discussion. (See considerations for
curriculum authors 1F, 2F.)
● Sensitivity to marginalization
Balance the experience of students with
potential learning gains by minimizing potential
embarrassment of marginalized students. Directly
addressing an equality issue (gender, ethnic, etc) is
necessary but may draw attention to disparities and
stereotypes among students. (See considerations for
curriculum authors 1F, 2D and ESD competency in the
Introductory chapter – thinking and acting inclusively.)
● Opening dialogue
Avoid thinking that your publication needs to
maintain a singular focus on SDGs. Any connection
to an SDG could go further but it is acceptable and
even good to leave space for teachers and students
to advance the conversation. Related to this, even a
few explicit connections to sustainable development
may prompt teachers and students to consider
connections in mathematical ideas that the textbook
does not connect to SDGs. (See considerations for
curriculum authors 3B, 4B, 5C and ESD competency
in the Introductory chapter – participating and
collaborating.)
● Collaboration
Encourage and initiate group work by writing
questions and instructions that ask for it. This enables
students to hear each other’s ideas and thus develop
their sensitivity to the value of other voices (related
to SDGs 5, 10, 16). (See considerations for curriculum
authors 1C and ESD competency in the Introductory
chapter– participating and collaborating.)
● Access
Minimize the cost of curriculum resources (this is an
issue for publishers more than it is for authors). The
cost of a textbook aff ects its accessibility, which is
a social justice concern (SDG 4). For a textbook to
be accessible, it also needs to use language that is
comfortable for the student and contexts that are
familiar. These elements are more the responsibility
of authors than publishers. (See considerations for
curriculum authors 2B, 3E, 3F.)
● Using technology
Consider the technology available to the students
who will be using the textbook and capitalize
on it as a source for information. In addition to
using computers to access information online,
smartphones can be used creatively to collect and
map data in a community. Today’s smartphones
can be equipped with useful features such as GPS
capability, seismometers and apps that analyze
sound. For an example of smartphone use, please see
the work of Laurie Rubel (for example, Rubel, Hall-
Wieckert and Lim, 2016).
● Courage
Address politically sensitive issues boldly but
consider the risks students and teachers may face
when exploring them. Sensitive issues are the most
important ones and should not be avoided, but
it is wise to leave judgments to the students and
teachers based on their mathematical investigation
and knowledge of the relevant contexts. Avoiding
politically sensitive issues suggests they are not as
important as others. (See considerations for curriculum
authors 5D.)
● Trust
Allow the teachers who work with the textbook to
exercise their professionalism and guide students
through the challenging conversations that will arise
with real community and environmental issues as the
contexts of their mathematics. It may be that teachers
are unable to do as much preparation as one would
like but the profession can only grow in capability
when teachers are entrusted with their role. It is
unwise to try to micromanage the teacher through
the textbook. On the other hand, teacher guides that
accompany textbooks are an appropriate space in
which to advise teachers on handling ESD eff ectively.
Students must be conscientious and compassionate
in their work when dealing with complex issues
and textbook authors need to trust them to do this.
Without such trust, students will not develop the
required skills and experience to be active citizens
and stewards of the community and environment.

Examples of embedding ESD in
mathematics text
4.0
CONSIDERATIONS FOR TEXTBOOK AUTHORS
1A Mathematical education resources may use
imaginary or real contexts. With imaginary contexts,
it is possible to devise a situation that helps focus on
particular mathematical skills. However, contrived
situations like this do not refl ect the real, more messy
numbers that people experience outside school.
Using real data sends the message that mathematics
is relevant to the lives of students and others. It also
supports students’ attachment to the mathematics
because they work with information that directly
connects with their experiences.
Guideline – real contexts
1B The textbook may provide all the data necessary
for students to complete the task or some of it. Either
way, it is important to cite sources for real data used
in the textbook and other possible sources for further
investigation. Citing the sources makes it clear to
students that the data is real and sends the message
that mathematics is applicable to real situations
and inspires confi dence in students’ ability to use
their mathematics with real data. In this example,
some useful data is given in the task but some of the
questions direct students to look at further data. Even
though data sources change over time, it is good for
students to access publicly available data so they
develop the skills and confi dence for using them.
Guideline – access to data
1C A textbook can ask explicitly for group or
individual work. Example 1 is designed for group
work. Collaboration is an important part of educating
for peace and especially for global citizenship.
Collaboration is also important for developing
sustainability because it enables the inclusion of
multiple perspectives. In groups, students hear
each other’s ideas and are motivated to explain
their thinking. Justifying mathematical thinking is
an important part of citizenship because it is part
of responsible public discourse and it underpins
challenges to traditional or current practices.
Although this example is designed for group work, it
does not explicitly say it requires groups. Group work
can be implied with requests for explanation (for
example, ‘tell each other’) but it could be suggested
more strongly (for example, ‘decide as a group’ or
‘prepare a presentation for your class’). When students
are developing presentations on real societal issues,
it can be very productive for them to present to
relevant community organizations. However, it is
relatively challenging to specify such audiences
in a textbook because the author cannot predict
what audiences would be available to students to
address in diff erent contexts. When students present
to people outside their classroom, they tend to do
better work – with clearer communication and more
care put into ensuring they understand the situation.
Guideline – collaboration
1D Real contexts that have meaning for students
are likely to cause embarrassment for some of
them. Overweight students in the class may be
embarrassed by this example. Other contexts
may draw attention to certain students’ wealth,
poverty, parental education levels, minority ethnic
identities, and the list goes on. Contexts that address
community issues may connect students to particular
industries (perhaps through a parent’s occupation)
or to particular environmental concerns. However,
if mathematics education resources do not use real
contexts that matter to students, their mathematics
will not seem meaningful. To reduce the possibility
of shame, this example does not ask students to
measure themselves to calculate their own BMIs,
4.1
EXAMPLE 1
Measurement and comparison
People develop standards to measure things important to them. These standards enable comparisons to be
made with better precision. As with any measurements, it is worth discussing what is measured and what is
not. The text below is an example of an investigation that explores a recently developed measurement unit,
the body mass index (BMI), which represents the ratio between a person’s mass (in kilograms) and the square of
the person’s height (in metres). This example is designed with Grade 8 children in mind (approximately 13 years
old) but could be immediately applicable to a range of ages depending on curricular expectations in diff erent
jurisdictions. The context draws on statistics drawn from reputable and accessible data sources.
Example 1 involves comparisons between countries, which can connect to the experiences of many students. It
connects BMI with SDGs 1 and 2 ‘no poverty’ and ‘zero hunger’.
Justifying
mathematical
thinking is an
important element of
citizenship because it
is part of responsible
public discourse and
underpins challenges
to traditional or
current practices
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 53
Contexts for ESD are
normally complex
and interdisciplinary.
To build students’
understanding of
the mathematics,
it is helpful to ask
questions that
may not seem
immediately relevant
to the mathematics
although it would be conceptually helpful for
them to do this. Textbook writers need to carefully
balance the experience of students with potential
gains, including mathematical gains and improved
understanding of an issue. It is necessary to consider
the possible discomforts students may face when
doing a task, and to think creatively about how this
discomfort could be reduced.
Guideline – sensitivity to marginalization
1E Word problems in mathematics education texts,
whether they are parts of exercises, investigations
or examples, often provide examples of people
doing mathematics to address social issues and/
or expose social inequalities. A text may draw
attention to this. In this way, the example overleaf
might have accompanying commentary that points
out the mathematics in the source material: ‘People
sometimes invent units to measure something
important to them. This makes it possible to include
the idea in conversations that matter to them. The BMI
is an example of this.’ Or ‘Bar charts and line graphs are
often used by decision-makers to understand trends
and make predictions. This graph helps us understand
the signifi cance of malnutrition in our world.’ It is
not necessary to have such commentary on every
mathematical task because students can generalize.
They see how people are using mathematics in the
context here and they also pay attention to people’s
mathematical choices in other contexts.
Guideline – human activity
1F Contexts for ESD are normally complex and
interdisciplinary. To build students’ understanding of
the mathematics, it is helpful to ask questions that may
not seem immediately relevant to the mathematics. It
is necessary to understand the context to understand
the way the mathematics works in the context. In
the example overleaf, there are questions such as
‘Research how the word “undernourished” is defi ned.
Why do you think it is defi ned like that?’ or ‘What
are some reasons for these changes in BMI?’ In fact,
defi nitions of undernourishment will often rely on
some measurement (and thus mathematics). Also,
when considering growth and trends in graphs, it is
necessary to think about the reasons for the trends.
Guideline – interdisciplinarity
The fi rst set of opening questions requires students
to understand the mathematical communication
in the excerpt from the Worldwatch Institute and to
communicate that information in another way. The
questions ask for possible reasons, which would
direct students to think about the social context in
connection to the mathematics. The questions also
ask for a procedural application of the BMI, which is
another level of understanding (sometimes called
‘instrumental understanding’ as opposed to ‘relational
understanding’). The fi rst set of continuing questions
also demands some procedural work and some that
connects the mathematics to the social context.
The second set of opening questions and connecting
questions focus on interpreting the graph, which
requires previously learned graph skills. This is
supplemented by explicit connection to SDGs and
draws attention to the strong connection between
defi nitions of categories and the social contexts
the categories are supposed to address. One of the
connecting questions engages students in modelling
when they are asked to develop a reasoned
argument for a projection of the data into the future.
They will have to think about context in relation
to mathematics as they consider the possibility of
eradicating malnourishment – for example, is the
trend linear or does it show exponential decline?
The connecting questions bring the two contexts
together. Students are invited to consider the kinds of
statements they would want to make about poverty/
wealth and health, and to use their mathematical and
communication skills to achieve their purposes.
Too much or too little?
Th e number of overweight people is on the rise
Th e number of overweight adults worldwide jumped from
1.454 billion people in 2002 to 1.934 billion in 2010, an
increase of 25 per cent. Some 23 per cent of individuals
aged 15 or older were overweight in 2002, while in 2010 the
fi gure rose to 38 per cent – even though the number of adults
increased by only 11 per cent during these eight years.
Much of this change occurred in the industrial world.
Economic, cultural and possibly genetic factors all played a
part. But in every country where people have become heavier,
the result has been the same: an increase in preventable
medical problems.
Th e term ‘overweight’ is used here for people with a body
mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater. BMI is a measure relating a
person’s height to weight. (A person with a BMI of 30 or above
is usually labelled ‘obese’ but here the term ‘overweight’ covers
overweight and obese populations combined.)
Th e data considers people aged 15 and older in 177
nations (an area that accounts for the vast majority of the
world’s population).

Opening questions
• What is the Worldwatch Institute saying to us? Describe it in
your own words.
• Explain its conclusions using the data.
• What are some reasons for these changes in BMI?
• Investigate the calculation of BMI for a human who is
overweight or even obese.
• What does this quote ‘even though the number of
adults increased by only 11 per cent during these eight
years’ mean?
Continuing questions
• What was the number of all people in the researched nations
and age group?
• What do you suppose are the diff erences in developing or
industrial countries? Is there a diff erence between women
and men?
(Data can be found at http://databank.worldbank.org/
data/reports.aspx?source=health-nutrition-and-populationstatistics.)
Halve the proportion of undernourished people
(1990–2015) – Target 1c of the Millennium
Development Goals
Current estimates suggest that about 795 million people are
undernourished globally. Th is means that nearly one in nine
individuals does not have enough to eat. Th e vast majority
of them (780 million people) live in the developing regions.
However, projections indicate a drop of almost half in the
proportion of undernourished people in the developing
regions, from 23.3 per cent in 1990–1992 to 12.9 per cent
in 2014–2016.
(Source: Th e Millennium Development Goals Report 2015.)
Opening questions
• Tell each other what you see in the graph.
• Research how the word ‘undernourished’ is defi ned –
why do you think it is defi ned that way?
• Which UN sustainable development goals are being
addressed?
• How many people lived in the world between 2014 and
2016? How many were there between 1990 and 1992?
Continuing questions
• Which is more important, the proportion of undernourished
people or the actual number of undernourished people?
Develop an argument for each answer.
• Can you create a reasonable projection? Based on this graph,
what do you expect to happen in the years up to 2030?
Connecting questions
• Compare the number of undernourished and overweight
people, for example, in 2010.
• In the industrial countries, we may fi nd the term
‘underweight’. Research diff erent defi nitions of ‘underweight’
and ‘undernourished’ (one defi nition of underweight is a
BMI < 18.5).
• Design a presentation that addresses the issues of BMI and
malnourishment. Use examples of people with the same
height and diff erent weights to illustrate the categories of
overweight, underweight, etc. (or use examples of people
with the same weight and diff erent heights).

56 | MATHEMATICS
CONSIDERATIONS FOR TEXTBOOK AUTHORS
2A Mathematics textbooks may be organized
around contexts or around mathematical concepts
or processes. An advantage of organizing around
contexts is that more details about the context can
be developed (which is good for understanding
socio-cultural situations) and more mathematical
connections may be developed. For example,
symmetry is connected to measurement, estimation
is connected to shape and multiplication, and
estimation is involved in all aspects of mathematics.
These connections are important for developing
systems thinking. A concern may be that teachers may
need higher mathematical competence to support
students’ mathematical skill development when the
resource seems to foreground context. However,
teachers’ mathematical competence will increase as
they engage students in such rich contexts, just as the
children’s competence will grow. The alternative is to
use simplifi ed and narrow concepts, which would
limit the development of both teachers and students.
Guideline – foregrounding context
2B The cost of a textbook aff ects accessibility, which
is a social justice concern.
Guideline – access
The fi rst chapter of this book features beautiful
architectural photos of a 300-year-old tomb in an
Indian region where Muslim people are marginalized
and their technical skills are not typically recognized.
The text celebrates the skill of the tomb’s Muslim
architects and also that of contemporary Muslim
masons, who have created beautiful tiling for the
Jagriti School in Murshidabad. The text does this
subtly – it does not explicitly draw attention to the way
this story provides a counter-example to the region’s
dominant narratives – for example, it does not say: ‘See
how skilled and creative Muslim people can be.’
2C The selection of story contexts for mathematical
problems allows us to portray majority or minority
cultures as heroic (exercising skill and agency) or
passive. These selections subtly infl uence students’
views about people from these demographic groups
and provide an opportunity to counter dominant
narratives. However, students may see such choices
as ridiculous if the stories are fi ctional or if the text
overstates the skills. True stories are preferred,
especially if they are well documented. As noted in
consideration 1a, real data and real stories enable
students to envisage themselves using mathematics
in their experiences.
Guideline – real contexts, human activity
2D As identifi ed in consideration 1D, it is important
to think about how the selection of contexts and
protagonists will aff ect students from diff erent
demographics in the classroom. In this case, one
might wonder how a Muslim student or the child
of a brick worker would feel. Example 2 is written to
celebrate human design so it is hard to imagine how
someone might feel slighted by it.
Guideline – sensitivity to marginalization
2E It is always important to think about where
the text directs students’ attention. As noted in
consideration 1E, an author may choose to identify
mathematical processes explicitly or not. In this
case, the people in the story become excited by the
ingenuity of others, which is a way of identifying
human mathematical action. Task 7 in Example 2
explicitly requests students to think about people
working with geometry.
Guideline – human activity
2F It is important to think about how mathematical
tasks move between particular contexts and the
4.2
EXAMPLE 2
Shape and space
Math-Magic – Book 4 is published by India’s National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT,
2007). The 170-page book covers the range of outcomes required for nine-year-olds in India and is distributed
at the cost of 30 rupees (less than 0.5 euros) per book. It is organized around contexts rather than mathematical
concepts. For example, the fi rst context features a story about brickwork. The chapter covers 12 pages and is
used to engage students in counting large numbers, symmetry, perspective drawing, design of arches and
triangles using rectangular bricks, estimation, measurement and multiplication. (For a more detailed description
of the book and the others in its series, see Anita Rampal’s plenary address from the Mathematics Education and
Society conference in 2015. Both the paper and her talk relating to the paper are available on the conference
website: http://mescommunity.info.)
In Example 2, we will use the same context for a possible textbook page that develops concepts relating to tiling
and tessellations. The opening paragraph (in italics) is copied from the Math-Magic textbook and the photo
represents some tiling similar to that done by the Jagriti School masons. The example connects with United
Nations SDGs 9 and 10 (innovation and reduced inequalities). The story may help reduce inequalities because
it highlights the capability of people who are often marginalized, positioning them as innovators who build
structures for their communities.
Mathematics textbooks

abstract. Example 2 moves back and forth between
the particular and the general. This is a way of
ensuring students think of their abstractions and
generalizations in terms of how they are used in
particular contexts. This both develops skill with
generalization and, hopefully, avoids the dangers of
abstraction because the abstractions are connected
to contexts consistently.
Guideline – complexity, interdisciplinarity
Beauty and effi ciency
Th is is the true story of Jagriti School in Murshidabad (West
Bengal). When its building was being made, there was a
plan to make brick patterns on the fl oor and walls. Jamaal,
Kaalu and Piyaar were the masons for the brickwork. Th ey
wanted to get new ideas for the school building. So they
took their other friends to see the old tomb of Murshid
Kuli Khan. Th e masons came back excited. Jamaal said:
‘Ah! In those days they had made so many interesting brick
patterns. We had forgotten these! Let us make some nice
designs on the fl oor of this school.’ Each mason made a
diff erent brick pattern.
1. Draw some other designs you could make with
rectangular bricks like these on the right.
2. What other shape for a brick could be used to cover
a fl oor?
3. Measure the angles of your shapes that could cover
a fl oor.
4. Find the sum of the angles that meet at one point in
your brick patterns.
For thousands of years, people have used bricks to build
structures and to tile fl oors. In both cases it is important to
cover a space with no gaps. Architects also want to make
their work beautiful. Diff erent cultures oft en have unique
design preferences. Muslim architecture is known for its
complex tiling. Th e tiling in this photo is basic and very
practical.
In mathematics, the word ‘tiling’ is used to talk about the
study of shapes that can be placed alongside each other to
fi ll space completely without leaving gaps. Th e sum of the
angles at any intersection of shapes must be 360˚, which is
a full rotation.
5. Use your knowledge of angles to decide whether it is
possible to tile:
a) a square
b) a regular pentagon
c) a regular hexagon
d) any triangle
The tasks in Example 2 invite students to design
shapes that they like aesthetically and/or fi t their
practical needs. This is connected to the technical
skills of measuring angles and the abstract idea that
the angles meeting at a point of tiling must have
a sum of 360˚. This general principle is applied to
various known shapes and to the particular shapes
the students choose in their designs.

58 | MATHEMATICS
CONSIDERATIONS FOR TEXTBOOK AUTHORS
3A The grammar of curriculum materials is
signifi cant. This chapter is written in a traditional
way, with no mention of the authors. This matches
the voice of the other chapters. However, the next
paragraph immediately below uses a diff erent voice
in which the authors refer to themselves, using fi rstperson
pronouns (I, my, me, we, our, us). An ‘I’ or
‘we’ voice reminds readers that the authors have a
perspective and that other perspectives are possible.
These fi rst-person voices also help the reader to
understand the connection between decisions and
goals; it allows the reader to see how the author(s)
sympathize or empathize with their experiences.
There are some mathematics textbooks that include
fi rst-person texts (for example, Small et al, 2007) but
they are rare. An interest in sustainable development
and peace would be well served by text that
identifi es the author’s perspective. It underscores the
signifi cance of participation and responsibility, which
are universal principles for sustainable development.
Guideline – human activity
In this chapter, we wanted to include an example
that develops an important mathematical concept
that is relatively diffi cult to connect to sustainable
development or peace. We knew from our own
writing experiences that certain mathematical
topics lend themselves better than others to any
considerations for embedding values, pedagogical
approaches or general structures. Algebra is relatively
diffi cult to connect to peace and sustainable
development because it is, by nature, a step into
abstraction. In other words, algebra is one of the
most important tools for operating independent of
context (the opposite of honouring local knowledge,
the opposite of participation – both of which are
universal principles for sustainable development).
As we outlined at the beginning of the chapter, there
is danger in abstraction but there is also value in it.
An important movement in mathematics education
is the Algebra Project, developed by Bob Moses to
redress inequities in access to high-level mathematics
in the USA. In this context, ‘Algebra’ is the name of a
high-school course that includes algebra and other
topics. The Algebra Project promotes good pedagogy
in algebra and the other topics. The name ‘Algebra
Project’ refers to the course more than to algebra. The
course enables access to higher education, so it is
important to ensure access to the course and success
for marginalized demographics.
Example 3 was the hardest to write for another
reason, too. It is an example of exposition, where the
other examples are of student tasks (which can be
used as examples, exercises or investigations).
3B Most mathematics textbook materials include
some exposition. Word problems and investigations
(when used as examples or in exercises) lend
themselves more easily to embedding sustainable
development because they invite response from
students. Exposition tells students things and typically
presents one point of view. In this way, it goes against
the ESD competency ‘participating and collaborating’.
Nevertheless, some information is necessary to invite
participation. To illustrate, Examples 1 and 2 above
both provide some information before inviting
students to do things.
Guideline – opening dialogue
Example 3 is designed to introduce the concept of
a variable to students at Grade 5 or 6. The example
develops the idea of a variable and uses a context
of inequitable access to water, which relates to
SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). The context is
not particularly signifi cant to the mathematics for
most of the exposition, but this changes with the
closing questions that compare two situations. When
students are asked to use their new mathematical
notation to describe the situation they would
promote, they have to connect the mathematics to
their ideas about equity. The people in this imaginary
context do not use the variable or algebra to address
the inequity. However, this example text invites
students to use algebra to describe and represent the
inequity and guides them in how best to do it.
3C Any mathematical lesson that uses a context
relating to peace or sustainable development is
ripe for cross-curricular discussion. Example 3’s text
could also be used as a prompt for social studies
outcomes. Authors of mathematics textbooks would
benefi t from browsing through the United Nations’
SDGs and considering how these goals relate to the
experiences of the students who are likely to be using
the textbook. Example 3 uses a fi ctional context
unlike the fi rst two examples in this chapter (see
consideration 1A).
Guideline – real contexts
3D As was the case in Example 1 (see consideration
1D), this example has the potential to embarrass
students. Children with poor access to water might
be embarrassed by their families’ poverty and others
with good access might be embarrassed by their
relative privilege. The text in this example does not
4.3
EXAMPLE 3
Algebra
The following example is written to demonstrate ESD in the algebra curriculum.
Any mathematical
lesson that uses a
context relating to
peace or sustainable
development is ripe
for cross-curricular
discussion
judge; it does not criticize wealth or poverty. It is
appropriate to leave such judgment and discussion
in the hands of a teacher in discussion with students.
Guideline – sensitivity to marginalization
3E Accessibility of materials is important, as
identifi ed in consideration 2B, but it means more
than the cost of textbooks. Accessibility also refers to
the potential for readers to understand the contexts.
When choosing contexts for mathematics textbooks,
it is important to use situations that students will
understand and social tensions that relate to their
concerns. Of course, this is a challenge when the text
is developed to be used widely. Example 3 is written
to be accessible to children in India.
Guideline – accessibility, current issues
3F A further meaning of accessibility is the language
of the text. All our examples are in English, which
is not the fi rst language of many people learning
mathematics. It is important to provide materials that
students can read, which means using languages
they know fl uently, and also using vocabulary and
sentence structure that is within their comfort zone.
Example 3 is written more conversationally than
many typical mathematics expositions.
Guideline – accessibility
In this example, students are introduced to the central
idea of algebra, which is, by nature, a step into the
abstract. In the tasks at the end, it connects questions
relating to equity with algebraic representation. Thus
students will have to be able to use algebraic notation
properly and they are led to think about it in terms of
a social situation, motivated by equity concerns.
Showing a relationship
Look at the container (ghada)
pictured left . In the winter
months, Kumar fi lls one of
these containers with water
once a day from the lone tap
in the compound that supplies
municipal water to 20 other
families too. Sometimes Kumar
manages to fi ll the ghada fully
and sometimes he only manages to fi ll half the ghada before
the tap runs dry.
Kumar’s family of four has only the water he manages to
bring in the ghada for drinking and cooking for the whole
day. At Aruna’s home, in an expensive, middle-income-group
colony nearby, water is always available. Aruna’s family uses
ten times the amount of water per day that Kumar’s family
uses for cooking and drinking.
• If Kumar’s family uses 1 litre a day, Aruna’s family
consumes 10 x 1 litres that day.
• If Kumar’s family uses 2 litres a day, Aruna’s family
consumes 10 x 2 litres that day.
• If Kumar’s family uses 7 litres a day, Aruna’s family
consumes 10 x 7 litres that day, and so on.
• Do you see a pattern?
• How would you write that down?
Th e relationship between the two amounts can be written
this way:
Th e amount
Aruna’s family
uses in a day
= 10 x
Th e amount
Kumar’s family
uses in that day
If you are going to write or talk about this relationship oft en,
it would be good if there were a shorter way of representing
this pattern rather than writing out the equation every time.
We can represent the amount of water Aruna’s family uses in
a day by the letter a, and the amount used by Kumar’s family
in that day by the letter k. Aruna’s family uses a litres daily and
Kumar’s family uses k litres daily.
• Th en the relationship could be written like this:
a = 10k
• So, if k = 5, then a = 10 x 5 = 50
• If k = 3.5, then a = 10 x 3.5 = 35
Here k represents an unknown amount. In fact, did you notice
what happens to the value of a as the value of k varies? It keeps
varying (changing). Again, if the value of k changes, what
happens to the value of a? Both these values change in a way
that keeps the relationship between a and k the same. Since the
values of a and k change, both a and k are called variables, that
is, their values vary.
Now, if you look at the relationship a = 10k, you will see
Kumar’s family only has one tenth of the water Aruna’s family
uses per day:
k = a ÷ 10 or k = a/10
Aft er a few months, summer has come and Aruna’s family
starts using more water, while Kumar’s family gets even less
than before. In fact, Aruna’s family starts using 25 times the
amount Kumar’s family manages to get per day.
• How would you show this relationship using variables?
• Do you think it is right for some families to get very little
water and for others to get lots and lots of water? Discuss
this with your friends.
• What pattern of water distribution would you want in your
locality? Write the pattern using variables.

60 | MATHEMATICS
CONSIDERATIONS FOR TEXTBOOK AUTHORS
4A The context of the schooling is a signifi cant
factor in the construction of texts that will speak to
those traditions. This example follows a Japanese
tradition of inquiry whereby students dwell on a
single, complex problem. Guided by their teacher,
the students connect their experiences to the
problem and suggest a variety of ways to think about
the posed questions over one or more class periods.
Thus, the text in Example 4 may not work well in a
context where students and teachers are not yet
accustomed to this kind of deep inquiry. However, it
is the kind of inquiry that addresses ESD well so it is
worth considering how a textbook can contribute to
developing this kind of approach.
Guideline – complexity
This example uses weather data to engage
students in the mathematical process of prediction.
It is designed for Grade 10 students. The text
guides students through the kind of processes
used by meteorologists, engineers and
planners, who make decisions
based on weather and
climate patterns.
This text addresses
sphere geometry
and boxplots. It also
positions mathematics
as a useful tool for
meeting human needs in the
face of disasters.
4B In any context, there
is potential for deeper
connections to sustainable
development goals. In this
example, the text refers
explicitly to life on land but it
naturally connects to a deeper
question about causes. In this case,
climate change is a factor. Similarly,
for other mathematical contexts,
teachers may engage students in dialogue about the
causes of the situation in the context. Those deeper
conversations may explore more SDGs and may also
(or otherwise) explore further mathematics. The
text need not guide the teacher do to this but it is a
possibility. Authors need to consider how deep they
want to take students in their questions.
Guideline – opening dialogue
4C The way the text positions students has strong
implications for how they think of themselves in
relation to mathematics and also in relation to
human challenges. It is best to use contexts that have
the student acting in the role of someone taking
leadership for positive action. In Example 4, the
task positions the student as an expert analyst (not
necessarily a potential victim of the typhoon) who is
advising others what to do in the face of imminent
danger. The students are positioned as an expert with
their mathematics and as an ally to people who are
suff ering or potentially suff ering.
Guideline – human activity
Other considerations for textbook authors
As identifi ed in consideration 1A, this example uses
real data and thus sends the message that students
can use their mathematics to address their concerns.
As identifi ed in consideration 1B, this example cites
its sources to underscore the reality of the data and to
develop students’ ability to fi nd data relevant to their
lives. Example 4 explicitly identifi es mathematics as a
human endeavour, unlike the other examples in this
chapter (see consideration 1E), and it also positions
the student as a user of mathematics in human
concerns. There are no actors except the student, so
no majority or minority actors in the narrative (see
consideration 2C). This task has strong potential for
cross-curricular discussion (see consideration 3C)
because it connects well to science and geography.
Guideline – real contexts, access to data, human
activity
4.4
EXAMPLE 4
Modelling and prediction
The other four examples in this chapter focus on equity concerns. Example 4 features the human response to
the environment, specifi cally to SDGs 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land). The example is drawn from work
on typhoon data carried out as part of the lesson study tradition. It was presented at the APEC-Khon Kaen
International Symposium in Thailand in 2013 under the title ‘Innovation of mathematics education through
lesson study challenges to emergency preparedness for mathematics.’ This annual conference, sponsored by
APEC (Asia Pacifi c Economic Cooperation), is an example of the increasing global responsiveness to the UN
SDGs. See the conference websites (www.criced.tsukuba.ac.jp/math/apec/apec2013 and www.crme.kku.ac.th/
apec-thai2013.html) for more examples of lessons addressing typhoons and other emergency preparedness
situations. The mathematics of Example 4 is developed further by Nobuaki Kawasaki and Masami Isoda in an
e-textbook (available at www.crme.kku.ac.th/apec-thai2013.html by following the link ‘Expectation of some
natural laws by using mathematics – analysis of typhoon’s data’). The e-textbook used data distributed by the
Japan Meteorological Agency (www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/index.php).
The way text
positions students
has strong
implications for
how they think
of themselves
in relation to
mathematics and
also in relation to
human challenges.
It is best to use
contexts that have
the student acting in
the role of someone
taking leadership
for positive action
Here is some more data from the same typhoon. Th e map
shows the trajectory of the typhoon. Th e boxplot shows the
average wind speed at Nagoya and at Shizuoka. Th e chart
shows the ‘station pressure’ (sp), the average wind speed (aws)
and the maximum instantaneous wind speed (miws) as the
typhoon approaches and then moves past.
How can we prepare for
a typhoon?
Th ese images come from a recent typhoon in East Asia. On
the map, the points and numbers indicate the centre of the
typhoon on each day as it progresses.
1. Where does the speed of the typhoon increase? How
would you explain this? (Consider modelling the motion
by estimating the angles from the centre of the earth on
the map for each day. You can use the lines of latitude and
longitude for your estimates.)
2. Imagine how much water will be dropped by this typhoon.
Explain how you came to your conclusion. (Consider the
size of the cloud of the typhoon. What is its area? What
assumptions are you making about the amount of water in
the cloud?)
In the fi rst part of this task, students are led to think about how wind
patterns and land/water formations aff ect rainfall. They evaluate
typhoon speed by measuring distance travelled and for this they
would use angles (from the latitude and longitude markers) and their
knowledge of the size of the sphere (the Earth). This all requires careful
attention to units of measure. In the second part of the task, students
are asked to make predictions using the mathematical modelling
available to them, and to use these predictions to think about the
human response to potential suff ering. They will be able to see that
Nagoya will be the safer refuge because of the direction of the winds
EXAMPLE 4
Mathematics is a necessary tool
for predicting future events.
Assumptions are necessary in such
predictions so it is important to be aware of what assumptions
are used in the mathematical model you design or in the
mathematical models you read about.
1. If you are in Toyohashi, in the path of the typhoon, in which
direction would you evacuate? To Nagoya or Shizuoka?
2. What information does each form of representation show
especially well?
Mathematics helps us make informed decisions. Measurements
can be organized in graphs and charts to enable informed
hypotheses and make intelligent decisions.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR TEXTBOOK AUTHORS
5A In the above examples, consideration 1A and
others lauded the value of real data. A concern
about real contexts is that they may soon feel out of
date. When this chapter was written, this tweet was
current and signifi cant in a particular region. In three
years’ time, this message may have become relatively
unimportant politically or it may have increased in
signifi cance. The instructions for students in this
example, therefore, focus their attention on current
issues in their own contexts, which mitigates this
problem to some extent.
Guideline – current issues
5B Any choice of context suggests that the topic is an
important one for students. There are politics involved
in such a choice because other issues may be more
important to the students. In this example, the context
is likely to be relatively unimportant in countries
where refugee intake is not a political issue. Again,
the task is written in a way that focuses on the general
mathematical process of statistical comparisons. It
leads students to work with their own social interests
and apply that general process to particular, local
contexts. The text’s move to generalize shows that
representations of proportion can be done eff ectively
and/or dangerously in any context.
Guideline – values
5C The choice of a political hot topic may incite
criticism. People may think the text too politicized
for school. The text in this example is written to avoid
judgments about the quotation. It does not say the
quotation is fair or unfair. Instead, it invites students to
make judgments based on mathematical investigation.
This is what engaged citizenship looks like.
Guideline – open dialogue
5D Maths textbooks that attempt to avoid politics
and culture fail to do so – they are equally political.
Those apparently neutral texts actually tell students
that the contexts they use are the most signifi cant
and that sustainable development and peaceful living
are not important. Maths textbook authors should be
ready to put forward this kind of argument to counter
the inevitable criticism they will experience. Some
people fi nd change diffi cult to accept.
Guideline – courage
4.5
EXAMPLE 5
The fi nal example in this chapter serves to help us consider the range of political sensitivity a textbook author
faces. The example uses a political message from a country in which immigration is heavily politicized. The
message comes from Twitter, an online news and social networking site that is used not only by the general
public but by businesses to promote their services, partisan spin doctors to sway public opinion and reputable
journalists to disseminate news.
Example 5 is diff erent from the others in that it is an investigation, which means it gives relatively little direction.
While some of the other examples’ tasks are more investigative in nature, the other parts guide the students
to give them clues about how they might go about solving the problems presented in the more open-ended
elements. Example 5 leaves it up to the students to fi nd their own data and to devise mathematical methods to
communicate comparisons they are interested in promoting.
Mathematical metaphors
Someone posted the following on social media: ‘If I had a bowl of Skittles
and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? Th at’s
our Syrian refugee problem.’
Th ere are diff erent ways to look at this metaphor. For example, you
might ask if it is OK to compare refugees to sweets. We will focus on the
mathematics of the metaphor.
1. If you assume the comparison to be proportionally accurate,
investigate the statistical information you need to fi gure out how
many Skittles are in the ‘handful’.
2. Choose another risk to illustrate and compare to the risks of accepting
refugees. You may choose another hotly debated political issue (for
example, the dangers of handguns) or a concern that is usually
ignored (for example, the dangers of driving on a highway).
3. Present your fi ndings about the relative dangers of the two risks. Try
to use metaphors like the one quoted above (a candy metaphor or
something similar).
4. What are the values and dangers of using metaphors to illustrate
proportion and the risks people experience daily?
EXAMPLE 5
in relation to the direction of the typhoon path – the
winds are greater where the circular motion is added
to the typhoon trajectory, and the winds are lesser
where the two motions are in opposite directions (the
Coriolis force). Students use boxplots and histograms
to make statistical comparisons and they are asked to
evaluate the graphs in terms of the human purpose
in communication.

FROM ORIGINS ROOTED in natural philosophy, the
term ‘science’ has grown in our understanding to
embrace a great range of ways of knowing about
ourselves and the world around us. Relatively
recently, 19th and early 20th century recognitions
of specialisations such as biology, chemistry and
physics have helped to define what science is and
have expanded its boundaries further into many
other fields and disciplines. Common to many
global curricula and their supporting texts, science
is often viewed as a collection of isolated facts
organized into coherent topic-related blocks and
dropped into textbooks as foundational material
for later understanding and contextualization.
These facts are, indeed, essential building blocks
but it is equally important for textbooks to
recognize the role of science as a process of inquiry
that uses these facts to build a comprehensive
understanding of the world about us and our
interaction with it and each other.
For some authors, teachers and learners, there
exists an understandable confusion surrounding
the association of science (education) and the
social impacts associated with its application.
Learners and student teachers ask, rightly, if these
impacts have more relevance to the social sciences
than science (education) itself. For those science
textbook authors with this concern, it is worthwhile
noting that science is also a social practice
(Joldersma, 2009) with the same responsibilities
that other social practices are obliged to honour.
Thus, while this chapter focuses on textbooks for
the physical sciences, in considering embedding
education for sustainable development, it
necessarily concerns itself with social issues that
originate from their application (see sections 1.1,
2.1, 3.1 and 4.2–4.3).

technologies in all fields of human endeavour

prompts a need for a greater understanding of
its practise and its role in education and society.
The Science Council (2009) has gone some
way to providing this by defining science as
‘… the pursuit and application of knowledge and
understanding of the physical and social world
following a systematic methodology based on
evidence’. Therefore, it is perhaps useful in the
context of the approaches recommended in this
chapter to consider science not just as a body
of knowledge but also a process of discovery
(Bruner, 2009).
It is important to acknowledge that scientific
discovery and innovation have played a
significant role in the general improvement of
the human condition. However, the benefits of
this improvement have been – and continue
to be – distributed unevenly throughout the
world. Science exists in a complex relationship
with technology and society, and it is important
to note that there have been many misguided
applications of science theory and scienceinformed
technologies. Consequently, perceptions
of the role of science as a way of understanding our
place in the environment, our interactions with it
and each other have changed. Two progressively
technologized and industrialized world wars,
and unbridled mechanized resource exploitation
over the past century, have caused much
concern about the role and impact of applied
science and technology. This has changed the
perception of science from being a benign driver
of human progress to being viewed as increasingly
controversial, unpredictable and culpable as a
result of its inability to solve many unintended
consequences of its own creation. (The example
presented in section 4.2 illustrates one of many
such instances.)
Thus, the trustworthiness of the role of science in
guiding society (and societies) is frequently (and
often justifi ably) held in question as its applications
have become increasingly politicized and market
driven, resulting in many unsustainable practices
and developments (Johnston, 2013). While science
per se, as defi ned above, should not be seen as
the prime cause of this, its application in the
form of many economically driven, science-led
technologies can certainly be identifi ed as leading
to fundamentally unsustainable practices and
lifestyles.
Thus, this chapter asks the question: how can
science education reorientate the study of science
and its practice towards a more sustainable future?
It also proposes that a major tool for progress in this
endeavour is through the skills and commitment
of textbook authors embedding education for
sustainable development (ESD) within subjectspecific
content and considers strategies for
achieving this.
1.1
Motivation for embedding
ESD into science textbook
content
Globally, increasing dependence on scienceinformed
technology appears to have created as
many problems as it has solved. Many issues of public
concern have a science dimension, referred to here
and in the wider literature as socio-scientifi c issues
(SSIs). These have an origin in applied science theory
and have the potential to make a great impact on
societies (Ratcliff e and Grace, 2003). In the developed
world, SSIs ‘have come to represent important social
issues and problems which are conceptually related
to science’ (Sadler, Barab and Scott, 2007). These
impacts are associated with the widespread use of
economically driven, science-informed technologies
applied to resource exploitation. They operate across
a range of geographical scales and extend into most,
if not all, aspects of human endeavour.
However, it is a mistake to think of these issues
as belonging only to the developed world. These
impacts extend to the most vulnerable communities,
often located in countries of the developing world,
frequently disrupting previously traditional and
highly sustainable lifestyles (Goudie, 2005). It is clear
that science and, by extension, science education
make a signifi cant impact on human-environment
interactions, social and economic policies and the way
that people and communities interact with each other
at local, national and global scales. Thus, SSIs have a
direct and vital relationship with the multiple issues
associated with sustainable development (SD) and
the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals
detailed in the United Nations document Transforming
Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
(United Nations, 2015; see also the Introductory
chapter of this book). The multivariate nature of
SSIs and the interconnectedness of their causes and
impacts on a great diversity of global cultures presents
a considerable challenge to science textbook authors.
Nevertheless, it is an important guiding principle for
authors to recognize that SSIs are intimately associated
with embedding ESD in science content (see sections
3.0 and 4.0).
1.1.1
The need for an ethical
dimension in science
education
Changed perceptions of the role of science in society
(see section 1.0) have highlighted the unsustainable
and economically driven demands made currently
by a signifi cantly technocentric 21st-century society.
How can science
education reorientate
the study of science
and its practice
towards a more
sustainable future?
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 69
The certainties and seemingly absolute truths that
science off ered in the 19th and 20th centuries seem
to be not so certain in the light of many negative
impacts arising from its incorrect application and its
vulnerability to the vested interests of sponsors for
direction. To be able to address these issues, science
(and science education) must fi rst acknowledge
that it does not deal solely with absolutes and that
science must turn more towards the management
of uncertainties and unintended consequences,
frequently of its own creation.
Ashley (2000) notes this attitude as being central
to citizenship education for a sustainable society,
arguing that ‘… science curricula should be founded
on an understanding of the limits of science and an
appreciation of the fact that scientists are also moral
agents who face ethical dilemmas in their work’.
In considering the role of science education and
science textbook authorship, fostering this moral
dimension should not only apply to learners aspiring
to become scientists. Only a small percentage
of these learners will follow a career in applied
science or become practising scientists. However,
all learners will become citizens, either actively or
passively sharing the responsibility for our current
environmental and social impacts as well as for the
well-being and sustainability of present and future
generations. For active participation in society’s
decision-making processes (this being the essence of
active citizenship), a basic scientifi c literacy and the
inclusion of an ethical dimension to such decisions
provide a check and balance on the application of
science-informed technologies and scientists’ work.
An ethical dimension embedded into science
education, while clearly of benefi t to the individual
learner/citizen, is also a major benefi t to society as a
whole, enabling a capacity for critical evaluation of the
complexities of SD issues. As part of this innovative
approach, we propose that science education, as well
as being about ‘doing’ science, should also promote
critical evaluation of those social and environmental
issues associated with ‘the science’ – eff ectively
addressing what we have referred to above as socioscientifi
c issues (SSIs). This evolved role embraces
the idea that the teaching and learning of science
may foster increasing levels of understanding and
communication between countries and communities
for the common well-being. This moves science
education into the role of informing and facilitating
critical evaluation of SD issues and promoting the
use of subject knowledge to develop and propose
appropriate actions for the resolution of such issues.
1.1.2
Sustainable Development
Goals
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were
adopted by heads of state in 2015 and set the world’s
development agenda up to 2030 (United Nations,
2015). Target 4.7 of the SDGs is an acknowledgement
of the critical importance of education for peace
and sustainable development (United Nations,
2015; see also Box 2 of the Introductory chapter).
These goals are very much interdisciplinary and
are not connected exclusively to any specifi c fi eld.
They refer to sustainable development broadly,
embracing issues such as poverty, gender inequality,
health education, peace and governance, as well
as more commonly recognized issues such as the
environment and conservation of limited resources.
Thus, in using the term ‘sustainable development’,
it is important to note that this is taken to refer to
the full range of issues detailed by SDG Target 4.7.
Although discussed in the Introductory chapter, for
convenience these are reproduced below in Box 1.
1.1.3
Interconnectedness of
sustainability issues
Considering the interconnectedness of SD issues,
science (and by implication science education)
should not be perceived as a singular approach to
understanding our interactions with the world and
each other. Rather, it is more accurate to regard
science as one aspect of a multidisciplinary attempt
to make sense of and understand the world in which
we live. Moving towards this integrated outlook,
many science education policies and curricula

Key principles to guide the embedding
of ESD in science textbooks
2.0
In many contemporary societies, there is a gap between aspirations for a sustainable future and practical
solutions for achieving this. Embedding sustainability issues into science curricula and textbooks is an important
step towards developing the skills and understanding required to promote such a future. Achieving this while
maintaining the integrity of the role of the textbook in developing and transferring subject knowledge is a
considerable challenge.
The selection of content in response to curriculum requirements is complex and embedding ESD adds another
layer of complexity to science textbook authorship, particularly for those authors new to sustainability concepts
and issues. Even for those authors well versed in SD issues there will be diff erences in perception, prioritization
and contextualization arising from diverse cultural backgrounds and specialization. The multivariate nature
of the issues defi ned by the term ‘sustainable development’ (see section 1.1.2) and the wide-ranging cultural
backgrounds of the potential readership (and authors!) necessarily means there can be no single recipe for
embedding ESD into science content. Nevertheless, there are many over-arching principles that may serve as
a guiding framework. The Introductory chapter identifi ed a series of generic principles for embedding ESD.
Box 2 (opposite) identifi es nine key guiding principles that support embedding ESD into science textbook
content. Supporting references as an additional resource are also noted and fully sourced in the reference
section at the end of this chapter.
Many of the principles noted in Box 2 engage with the entire range of issues defi ned by the umbrella term
‘sustainable development’. However, some principles may not be able to be explored by some subject material
so may be passed over under these circumstances without detracting from the aims of ESD. The approach fi nally
adopted should ideally take into account the interconnectedness of the issues and the interdisciplinary nature
and potential of a fully integrated curriculum.
have promoted – and continue to promote –
interdisciplinary links between science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM). In doing so,
they seek to broaden the scope of understanding by
aligning the traditional sciences (biology, chemistry
and physics) with the fi elds of mathematics,
technology and engineering.
While such initiatives are praiseworthy, there remains
the danger of exclusivity in STEM relationships with
other subject areas, which defeats the point of a
holistic understanding of SD issues and appropriate
actions to address them. It is a mistake to think
of these combined fi elds existing independently
from other disciplines and wider social infl uences,
particularly from segments of society driven by
political and economic priorities. STEM initiatives
tend to be driven by demand for essential skills
defi ned by politically and economically motivated
actors. They are vulnerable to national and
multinational vested interests, which may be
incompatible with SD. Science research follows
research funding and, in this respect, funding is a
great determinant of the focus, goals and nature of
science education.
Therefore, it is useful for the science textbook author,
who is approaching embedding ESD, to be aware
of the socio-economic and associated political
drivers that may infl uence curriculum content
and so detract from the centrality and importance
of sustainable development issues. While this
observation does not directly off er practical advice
on how to embed ESD, it does contribute insights
to help with mining curricula for opportunities to
integrate science subject knowledge with the wider
social impacts of its application.
SD issues are complex and fostering an
awareness in learners of these wider issues by
embedding ESD into science curricula is essential
for equipping a new generation of ‘citizenscientists’
(Wals et al, 2014) with effective tools for
understanding and addressing the fundamental
nature of these issues. Since the content of most
science textbooks is guided by the requirements
of national curricula, this chapter aims to support
science textbook authors in identifying curriculum
opportunities for embedding ESD within required
science topics. The advice offered here focuses
on embedding ESD into textbooks while still
supporting the requirements of current science
curricula. In the interest of maintaining a focus
on textbook authorship, it leaves for another time
the discussion of the merits of a fully integrated
curriculum that embeds ESD.
In an increasingly
science-driven age,
with unprecedented
access to great
volumes of
information, a basic
scientifi c literacy
becomes essential
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 71
The role of the science
textbook in embedding ESD
Principles 1, 2, 4 and 6
Currently, science textbooks orientate towards
delivering information that is largely designed
to introduce learners to ‘how science works’ and
‘how to be scientists’. This is clearly important for
the welfare and greater benefi t of society overall
(consider the discussion of STEM in section 1.1.3).
However, it is not every learner’s aim to become a
scientist. Consequently, science education should
be obliged to provide more than simply career
opportunities. In an increasingly science-driven
age, with unprecedented access to great volumes
of information, a basic scientifi c literacy becomes
essential to make this information meaningful. Only
then can the learner function as an active citizen and
participate in society’s decision-making processes.
Thus, science education (and, by implication,
science textbooks) must extend well beyond the
role of simply producing scientists. In this respect,
embedding ESD in science textbooks informs our
interactions with each other and the impacts we
make on the environment. Above all, it enables active
citizenship for the development of a more sustainable
future by underpinning and supporting teaching
and classroom initiatives for embedding ESD in
science curricula.
Selection of content
Principles 1 to 9 inclusive
The material presented in science textbooks in
general does not change very radically from year to
year. In the main, content remains the same and the
science has been ‘done’, is ‘tried and tested’ and, most
likely, will remain the same at all levels of study for
some time to come. The exception to this is when
major discoveries invalidate current dogma and
experience. However, the perspective taken
in the presentation of topics is always open
to change and, in the current context,
this is exactly what needs to be achieved
in favour of ESD. Embedding ESD into
content should encourage learners to
manage their own learning goals by
developing their awareness of the wider
consequences and impacts of the uses
and applications of science in society.
The science textbook should provide
foundation information. However, it must
also develop a capacity for learning and
thinking strategies that take into account
diff erent perspectives, value the opinions
of others and enable actions as globally aware
citizens.
Box 2
Principles to support the embedding of ESD in science textbook content
1. Connect ‘issue-centric’ ESD to curriculum-based textbook formats and assessment frameworks (Church and
Skelton, 2010).
2. Introduce subject content and skills in the context of science, technology, society and environment (STSE)
relationships (Stratton et al, 2015; Azeiteiro et al, 2014; Johnston, 2009).
3. Ensure issues are defi ned and discussed in local contexts, taking into account learners’ experiences and cultural
identities while remaining connected with global impacts and consequences (Stibbe and Luna, 2009).
4. Promote critical evaluation of issues from multiple viewpoints (Warren, 2014; Wiek, 2011).
5. Identify and contextualize SSIs (such as environmental degradation and social confl ict arising from the
management of scarce resources) that can trigger deeper social injustices arising from unequal access to resources
and opportunities (Sipos, 2008; Veugelers, 2000).
6. Expand global awareness by promoting whole-systems thinking (Meadows and Wright, 2008).
7. Encourage learner-centred research to explore STSE relationships and use its fi ndings to inform social actions and
address SSI and STSE problems (Dietz et al, 2003; Bäckstrand, 2003; Blumenfeld, 1991; Th omas 2000).
8. Unpack the language of science into a more accessible and contextualized form that takes into account the impacts
and consequences of the use of scientifi cally informed technologies (Bybee, 2002; Rampal and Mander, 2013).
9. Emphasize the interconnectedness and multivariate nature of SD issues by fostering curricular and cultural links
between subjects and communities to enhance mutual understanding and communication
(Tilbury, 2011; Cohen, 2002).
72 | SCIENCE
Critical thinking –
evaluation/objectivity
Principles 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7
Case studies in science textbooks are frequently
used to contextualize learning. However, it is rare
that science textbooks explicitly facilitate learners’
understanding of social dilemmas associated with
scientifi c development and science-informed
technologies. There exists an understandably natural
fear of overlap with the social sciences. For those with
this concern, it is worthwhile considering science as
a social practice (without diluting the strengths of
the scientifi c method) (Joldersma, 2009). Evaluation
of socio-scientifi c issues invites value judgments
and this is not the norm in science textbooks, which
promote objectivity as a central axiom of scientifi c
methodology. This can be uncomfortable for
teachers, learners and all those who defi ne science
solely in terms of objectively derived conclusions.
Objectivity must be a central quality of scientifi c
observation and analysis if we are to avoid
misinterpreting the facts by seeing only what we
want to see rather than what is really there. However,
this should not be allowed to alienate the learner or
scientist from considering the wider consequences
of their subject and obscure their wider role as active
citizens. To summarize Joldersma (2011), while there
is such a thing as an objective reality, ‘this cannot
be perceived objectively, since it is mediated by
our own lenses’. It is these lenses that the ESDTable

and strengthen while retaining the advantages of
objective analysis. It is a considerable challenge for
authors to support learners in becoming profi cient in
the detail of their subject while fostering such skills.
Nevertheless, one of the main goals of embedding
ESD in science texts should be the development
of this capacity for critical evaluation of SSIs, their
impacts and implications through the lenses of the
learners’ experience (section 3.2).
Use of inclusive and
accessible language and
ESD perspectives
Principle 8
Many science textbooks are written in an authoritative
style that ‘informs’ the learner and presents facts
and defi nitions in an unquestioning manner. This
approach of ‘delivering’ a body of information to
a learner is aligned to a behaviourist perspective
of learning, which contrasts with a constructivist
approach, where learners are encouraged to
engage and make sense of a theme, thus actively
‘constructing’ their knowledge. A constructivist
style arouses curiosity, helps learners explore and
make connections with their own experiences, ask
questions, look for tentative explanations in their
own language, discuss and come to conclusions
collectively (see section 3.2). The style of writing a
text or presenting a theme depends on how authors

Instead of cursorily
including a technical
‘bio-sketch’ of a
scientist or coldly
presenting theories
and models, a more
human story – located
within its socio-cultural
and historical
contexts – enables
learners to connect
with the process
perceive learning to happen and it is important that
authors are sensitive to how learners think about
a concept and what alternative preconceptions
learners may have. A lack of this sensitivity can result
in science ‘defi nitions’ being merely reproduced but
not understood.
Research into learners’ ‘alternative frameworks’
or ‘intuitive ideas in science’ (Driver, 1985, 1994)
can help authors appreciate how various science
concepts (often routinely stated in textbooks)
are counter-intuitive for learners to understand.
Textbooks need to address learners’ intuitive ideas
creatively and provide structure for their progression.
For instance, children (and even adults!) have trouble
understanding that we stand on the surface of a
spherical planet that is spinning and that those on
the opposite side stand ‘upside down’ and yet do not
feel dizzy or fall off . Children as they develop may go
through a progression of ideas, from a fl at earth with
limited sky on ‘top’ and an absolute view of ‘down’,
to a spherical earth surrounded by sky with ‘down’
being towards its centre. The challenge for authors is
to trigger their imagination and thought to change
their intuitive notions. To embed ESD, therefore,
it is even more important that textbooks refl ect a
nuanced understanding of learners’ conceptions
across a wide spectrum of concepts. Moreover, where
learners’ conceptions arise from entrenched social or
religious beliefs, the language and perspectives of
the textbook play a crucial role in allowing a dialogic
engagement with scientifi c concepts (Rampal, 1994).
Presenting science not as absolute truth but as an
ongoing process of knowledge construction fosters
an appreciation of how scientists have grappled with
ideas. Instead of cursorily including a technical ‘biosketch’
of a scientist or coldly presenting theories
and models, a more human story located within its
socio-cultural and historical contexts allows learners
to connect with the process. It also indicates to
them that their own intuitive ideas in science are a
continuation of the process of observing and making
sense of the world around them, which humans have
been doing for centuries.
The language of science textbooks can be
impersonal, distant and transactional. This does not
help communication or learning (especially for young
learners) and inhibits their own expressions and
feelings, discouraging their active engagement and
compelling them to memorize statements. A more
expressive and personally engaged style that refl ects
uncertainties, curiosity, amazement, excitement,
adventure, frustrations and humour helps to relate
to learners and supports their understanding of
complex ideas (Rampal, 1992). The use of alienating
technical terms in elementary science textbooks
unnecessarily confounds the process of making
meaning for learners (Sutton, 1992; Rampal, 2008).
This is especially true when the language of the
textbook adopts terminologies that have no live
connections with people’s knowledge and spoken
registers (see section 4.1).
The Offi cial Languages Commission of India
(Government of India, 1956), which grappled with
the development of technical vocabularies for a
nation of vast linguistic diversity and low literacy,
wisely advocated that scientifi c terms for the
offi cial Indian languages should not be artifi cially
‘concocted’ as a literary exercise. Rather, it proposed
that terminologies be drawn from the vocational and
colloquial knowledge of artisans and technicians
and their own personally derived hybrid forms
of technical terminologies. This was rejected by
language purists with the consequence of alienating
and excluding large numbers of children because
popular and colloquial lexicons disappeared from the
language of textbooks. Thus, a language for learning
that identifi es with, connects with and evokes
empathy among young learners with a great diversity
of cultural identities, environments and ‘ways of
knowing’ is most eff ective for embedding ESD in
science textbooks. Section 4.1 considers further these
contrasting perspectives and writing styles and also
provides an example of good practice to support
eff ective ESD.

Models and strategies for embedding
ESD in science textbooks
3.0
The three approaches below are strong tools for embedding ESD into science textbook content.
1) A thematic approach, which links SD issues to curriculum content.
2) A science, technology, society and environment (STSE) approach, which makes clear connections between
science content and SD issues.
3) A problem-based learning (PBL) approach.
It is important to note that these three approaches are not mutually exclusive and it is more useful to consider
how they complement each other to inform the embedding of ESD rather than to look for diff erences between
them. In fact, the thematic approach (1) and problem based-learning approach (3) are as eff ective as extensions
of the STSE approach as they are in isolation.
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 clarify what each approach has to off er and detail how they contribute individually and
together to the eff ectiveness of embedding ESD in science texts. Ultimately, it is not a matter of choosing one
approach over another and textbook authors should feel able to ‘mix and match’ according to the demands of
the subject being addressed. Examples of their application follow in sections 4.2 to 4.4.
3.1
Thematic approach
Most science textbooks are non-thematic in nature.
They are structured linearly, governed largely by
curriculum considerations that tend towards blocks
of learning. These blocks are usually organized
in a sequence aimed at providing foundational
knowledge for later higher-level study. SD issues
are rarely addressed in context, other than as case
studies to aid subject learning or as interesting
asides. Few demands are made of learners to
research or contextualize the issues for themselves.
This is understandable since, in the context of current
educational priorities, the major emphasis is on
acquiring subject knowledge.
A thematic approach to science textbook authorship
can present the science as the central anchor,
mapping aspects of the topic against SSIs and
curriculum requirements (sections 4.2 and 4.3), or can
be issue-centric, where the issues play a major central
role and the science of the topics being studied is
used to explore them (section 4.3).
Figure 1 illustrates a tool for thematic embedding.
The science topic ‘genetically modifi ed organisms’
(GMOs) is the central anchor. The interconnectedness
of a range of SSIs is mapped against a selection of
curriculum opportunities.

It is important that such a mapping closely follows
the learning outcomes associated with the syllabus
and the age group of the learners. Particular attention
is paid to this in the examples presented in sections
4.2 to 4.4, where specifi c learning outcomes are
identifi ed and used to guide the selection of the
material being presented.
Opportunities for embedding ESD in this template
centre on the biology of genetically modifi ed
organisms, a key topic of many curricula, although
chemistry (at certain grade levels) may be appropriate
for inclusion as well. Mining biology curricula more
thoroughly on the basis of Figure 1 identifi es detailed
components such as DNA, protein synthesis, neo-
Darwinian genetics, antibiotic resistance, ecosystem
dynamics and the biological impact of monocultures.
Of course, these suggestions are indicative and
there are many other possibilities depending on
the syllabus being approached and the focus of the
textbook chapter/section.
Initially, this may appear to suggest that issue-centric
learning takes precedence over curriculum material.
However, this is not the intention because adopting
a thematic approach serves the dual purpose of
relating curriculum topics to each other (rather than
addressing them in isolation in a linear manner) while
associating them with SD issues as an integral part of
knowledge transfer.
Templates such as Figure 1 can be adapted to any
science topic that illustrates associations between
the application of science-led technologies and their
associated social impacts. As well as being a guide
for authors, templates such as these can be used
by learners to evaluate both positive and negative
associations between the science being learned, its
application and its potential impacts. However, it is
not suffi cient to identify the culpability of applied
science and technology, it is also vitally important to
explore science’s potential in addressing these issues
in a positive manner.
For example, in Figure 1 the impacts and consequences
associated with this technology are provided for the
reader. However, an alternative presentation might
be to leave these areas open to be responded to as
part of personal research, encouraging learners to
identify for themselves and evaluate critically the
consequences and propose informed actions on the
basis of their own scientifi c analyses. At this point,
the textbook embedding ESD can propose an open
structure and provide resources for debate to explore
the nuances of the issues identifi ed.
In summary, thematic approaches are eff ective
for embedding socio-scientifi c issues, identifying
these as global concerns and emphasizing the
interconnectedness of their impacts and causes.
Having identifi ed these associations (Figure 1), the
textbook author (or indeed the learner as noted
above) can explore SD issues that extend beyond the
science and make a global and local impact on current
and future societies, countries and ecosystems.
Clearly, this has the potential to off er an extensive
array of associations that lend themselves to
engaging with other topics within the science
curriculum and wider interdisciplinary associations.
However, we acknowledge that the major brief
given to most textbook authors is that of knowledge
transfer defi ned by the requirements of a given
curriculum within the confi nes of a particular subject.
Nevertheless, we do not believe that this is an
insurmountable barrier preventing authors from the
central task of ‘teaching science’ while taking note of
the principles noted in Box 2. Section 4.0 provides
examples to explore these challenges.
3.2
Science, technology,
society and environment
(STSE) approach
Many textbook authors will be familiar with the
STSE approach to science education. Nevertheless,
it is useful to redefi ne it here in the current context.
Although they evolved separately, the underlying
principles are constructivist in nature and relate
closely to those presented in section 2.1 (Box 2).
Figure 2 summarizes this model for science education
that emphasizes teaching science in its cultural,
economic, social and political contexts (MacLeod,
2015; Pedretti and Bellomo, 2013; Aikenhead, 2006).
In this approach, pupils and students are recognized
as being complex learners whose living experiences
can be incorporated into the learning and teaching
process and used as a starting point for embedding
ESD. Section 1.1 identifi ed learners as ‘future citizens
and decision makers in science and technology’,
who will bring about change in future societies.
However, learners do not always see themselves like
this, often feeling disconnected from the substance
and concepts presented in current curricula and
learning environments (Pedretti and Bellomo, 2013;
Aikenhead, 2006; Korfi atis, 2005).

76 | SCIENCE
Section 1.0 also noted how science has traditionally
been regarded as a body of knowledge based on
objectively assessed phenomena. This has greatly
infl uenced the manner in which scientifi c knowledge
is transferred to learners, that is, by neglecting to
take into account how they experience science and
technology on their own terms. Although usually
applied to teaching practice, this has much relevance
to science textbook content. Heavily content-based
science curricula (and, by association, textbook
support for this) are often remote from learners’
everyday experiences and fail to take into account
how content is related to real-life problems.
The STSE approach addresses this issue by ensuring
that SSIs and other SD issues have an integral and
relevant role in the material being presented. Figure 3
maps these relationships showing SD/SSIs occupying
the central domain of the graphic. Understanding
the nature of these issues and associating them
with curriculum material should be the main aim of
textbook authors using this approach. An outline
sequence is shown below:
Figure 3: Generic STSE model showing relationship of
key domains for embedding ESD
Five domains are identifi ed:
1) SD issues and SSIs are explored as the central
focus in this process.
2) Local and global connections are considered.
3) Curriculum connections are made (scientifi c
literacy).
4) Science inquiry and investigation are used to
inform (domain 5).
5) Pupils refl ect on and propose potential solutions
and actions for implementing them.
Together these result in ESD being embedded by
creating a framework of background knowledge for
‘inquiry and investigation’ to ‘identify local and global
contexts’ while ‘maintaining close connections with
curriculum requirements’.
The ultimate goal of the STSE approach (and its
application to embed ESD into science texts) is to foster
an understanding of the wider impacts of applied science
and technology and so enable actions for achieving a
sustainable future. Embedded ESD should encourage
learners to refl ect on the issues and their attitudes toward
them. SD issues need to be connected to learners’ own
lives to encourage meaningful refl ection and informed
actions. By taking this approach, learners are encouraged
to understand how their lives are connected to science,
technology and society. They can then become active
decision-makers and problem-solvers, advised by their
knowledge of science and informed by their personal
worldviews (Johnston, 2002).
Constructivist perspectives on the nature of learning
are founded on how people make sense of their
experience. Consequently, they have much to
off er the discussion of embedding ESD in science
textbooks. Authors wishing to explore these
perspectives further should see Constructivism as
Educational Theory: Contingency and Learning, and
Optimally Guided Construction (Taber, 2011).
3.2.1
Problem-based learning
Problem-based learning (PBL) aligns well with the
thematic and STSE approaches discussed above (see
sections 4.2 to 4.4 for examples). The fact that projectbased
learning and problem-based learning share the
same abbreviation can be the source of some confusion.
Project-based learning originated in medical schools as
‘competency-based learning’ around 1949 (see Frank
et al, 2010). Problem-based learning may be seen as a
progression of this, posing real-world problems using
case studies. For our purposes, the diff erence is largely
semantic with some minor operational distinctions.
Table 2 summarizes the similarities and diff erences in
the approaches and associates these with the ESD key
principles presented in Box 2.
Table 2: Project-based learning versus problem-based
learning properties associated with ESD principles (see Box 2)

Similarities
• A focus on open-ended questions/evaluations.
• Th e capacity for issue-centric applications of content and skills.
• Both build 21st-century success skills (future thinking).

Problem-solving contexts have been recognized
as eff ective ways to develop learners’ cognitive
reasoning, social knowledge and communication
and decision-making skills in science education
(Hmelo-Silver and Barrows, 2008; Kim and Tan, 2013).
An interactive setting for solving problems provides a
context in which learners can make claims, negotiate
and integrate diff erent types and levels of evidence
and knowledge and look for solutions to socially
relevant questions. PBL provides fertile ground for
embedding ESD in the form of a story or scenario (see
section 4.4). While this is particularly – although not
exclusively – eff ective for early-stage learners (Harris
and Katz, 2016), it is easily adapted for middle- and
high-school students (see section 4.4).
At the end of a given topic, embedding authors
may also fi nd this a useful self-check for the learner
– assessing their own understanding of both the
substantive science being taught as well as the
embedded SD component(s). Data analyses, analysis
of media articles and scientifi c appraisals of sciencerelated
projects and applications, which have relevant
connections with learners’ living experiences, are
all baseline resources available to textbook authors.
Useful further information on this approach can be
found in Larmer (2015) and Savery (2015).
IN SUMMARY
● STSE approach. Embedding ESD into science
topics can be enhanced greatly by aligning the
issues discussed (SSIs) with real-life experiences
relevant to the learner audience.
● PBL approach. This should encourage active rather
than passive learning by providing the stimulus
for analysis, debate and the proposal of researchinformed
solutions.
● Thematic approach. Embedding ESD should
develop science textbooks as an important
resource and reference point for supporting
learners and teachers by contextualizing their
understanding of the science being studied and
the socio-scientifi c and sustainable development
issues associated with its application.
Figure 4 draws together these three approaches,
revealing how the thematic approach integrates
with the STSE approach to explore the
interconnectedness of issues. It shows PBL as a
means of actively engaging the learners’ attention
with SD issues and the scientifi c knowledge being
presented.

Examples of embedding ESD in
science content
4.0
The following sections provide curriculum-based examples with advisory commentary to support the
embedding of ESD in science texts. These examples are not intended as recipes but are outline approaches.
They give authors scope to customize, taking into account diff ering curricular requirements, personal specialist
skills and the diverse cultural identities of the readership (and authorship!).
Understanding and accommodating learners’ modes of communication and perceptions of the world is
essential to be able to explore value-laden sustainability issues and associated SSIs. Section 4.1 builds on the
considerations of language style and author perspectives put forward in section 2.0 and provides a comparison
of approaches and an example of good practice using a recognized textbook. This operates at elementary/
primary level, however, the principles remain the same at more advanced levels.
Sections 4.2 to 4.4 provide original examples closely integrated with learning outcomes from a range of curricula
as a guiding template for authors approaching embedding ESD. The importance of making strong links with
curriculum learning outcomes, while also engaging with learners’ real-world perceptions and experiences
following a constructivist ethic, has already been emphasized. The examples presented in sections 4.2 to 4.4
consider how this can be achieved by applying the strategies discussed in sections 3.1 to 3.3.
4.1
Topic: Forests – use of
inclusive and accessible
language and ESD
perspectives
Principle 8
Most science textbooks adopt a utilitarian perspective
and approach to communicating science content.
Their modes of communication are frequently
perceived as remote, with few ‘real’ connections and
little personal engagement with the learner.
Forests and forest management are common topics
in curricula worldwide but perceptions of their
importance to our well-being and our interactions
with them vary widely. It is useful to consider
contrasting perspectives in dealing with this subject
at primary-level science (biology) as an exploration of
good practice in the context of ESD (see section 2.0).
Typically, mainstream textbooks approach this
subject by regarding forests as economic resources.
One such (elementary) Grade 5/6 extract promotes
an understanding of forests as valuable resources for
lumber, rubber, fruits, pulp and other commodities.
Having established this outlook, the textbook
then emphasizes the commercial and economic
perspective of large-scale employment:
‘There are over 300 million hectares of forests in the
United States … Many forests are located on public
land. Others are owned by individuals, private timber
and paper companies. Forest industries in the US
provide jobs for more than one million people. Because
new trees can be planted to replace tress cut down,
forests can be renewable resources.’ (Padilla, 2006).
The text then considers diff erent methods of logging
– showing diagrams of chainsaws, clear cutting and
selective cutting – leading to replanted or diverse
tree growth. Although sustainability is implied as a
consideration of the outcome of selective felling, this
is not the main thrust of the presentation and wider
issues of sustainability and the learners’ role in this are
not addressed.
The rhetorical question is then posed: ‘Why else are
forests important?’ with the response ‘Because they
produce oxygen, absorb pollutants, and help prevent
fl ooding and control soil erosion.’ This sentence is not
a simple ‘statement’ but involves several abstract and
diffi cult concepts. How ‘forests produce oxygen’ or
‘absorb pollutants’ are complex ideas which, although
taught later in the syllabus at more advanced levels,
are usually not understood at primary level.
These are anthropocentric perspectives and the
complex concepts are introduced prematurely. They
do not enhance the personal relationship between
the subject being studied and the learners’ ‘lived-in’
experiences, cultural identities and environments.
A contrasting example is the chapter provocatively
titled ‘Whose forests?’ from the Grade 5 textbook on
Environmental Studies (EVS) in India (NCERT, 2008,
Chapter 20, p. 182). EVS is the integrated form of
teaching science and social studies at primary level
(Grades 3–5). Box 3 provides an excerpt from the
National Syllabus for EVS (NCERT, 2006, p. 94).
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 79
The National Elementary Syllabus document (NCERT,
2006, p. 127) underpinned by this framework
consciously embedded an ESD perspective into EVS.
The following example chapter, ‘Whose forests?’, was
developed around the key questions for the subtheme
‘Forests and forest people’ in this syllabus:
Have you seen or heard about a forest?
How do people live in forests?
How is their life being threatened by
forests being cut?
Have you heard of a park or sanctuary?
Who looks aft er it?
Does anybody own it?
Have you seen a place where trees are
worshipped or protected by the villagers?
(NCERT, 2006, p. 127)
Box 4 (overleaf) shows the opening page of this
chapter. It begins with the true story of a woman
protagonist. Suryamani, who belongs to the
indigenous Kuduk-speaking community of forest
dwellers in the state of Jharkhand, strives to protect
the forest and her community’s local knowledge.
Learners consider forests through the eyes of the
community, their collective wisdom and their
perennial struggles through a ‘pedagogy of empathy’
(Rampal and Mander, 2013).
Advisory note for authors
‘Real-life’ documents, such as personal letters, historical
travelogues, biographies, family records and oral
narratives, are an eff ective means of personalising
subject content. Similarly, instead of using typical
illustrations of disembodied hands holding
instruments, textbooks can include an array of visuals
that refl ect an engaged multicultural human presence.
A textbook page designed as a dynamic visual text
can speak to learners and arouse their interest more
eff ectively than cold and authoritative science text.
Box 3
Excerpt of foreword from
National Curriculum
Framework 2005 (NCERT 2006)
‘Conventionally biologists divide living
things broadly into two categories
‘plants’ and ‘animals’. Th e idea of ‘plants’
is considered simple enough to be
presented in primary school along with
‘parts of a plant’, ‘functions of the parts
of the plant’, etc. But why should this
(reductionist) way of looking at a plant
be considered more ‘natural’ or even
desirable for a child? In fact, extensive
research across the world has shown that
young children fi nd it too abstract to
make a distinction between living and
non-living, or to divide the living world
between plants and animals … Th is has
led some primary school curricula to
postpone these conventional categories
and fi rst allow space to children to
explore their own intuitive ideas, in
order to achieve a better understanding
later, of how science tends to classify
them diff erently …
‘(In this syllabus they learn about
‘plants’ as connected to people, within
the larger theme of ‘Family and Friends’)
so in Class IV they look at ‘fl owers’
and fl ower sellers, or discuss ‘who
trees belong to?’, while in Class V they
move on to ‘forests and forest people’,
the notion of parks or sanctuaries,
and … in this way they are enabled to
construct a more holistically connected
understanding, from a scientifi c, social,
cultural and environmental perspective,
that is enriched with an aesthetic and
caring appreciation of plants around
them.’ (NCERT, 2006, p. 94)

‘Whose forests?’ Grade 5 (NCERT, 2008, latest reprint 2016)
􀀔􀀛􀀕 Looking Around
Daughter of the jungle
Look at the picture. Where do you think these children are off
to, with little bundles on their sticks? When you find out you
too would want to go with them!
The children are going to the forest. There they jump, run,
climb trees and sing songs in their language called Kuduk.
They pick the fallen flowers and leaves, to weave them into
necklaces. They enjoy the wild
fruits. They look for birds,
whose calls they imitate.
Joining them in all this fun is
their favourite didi – Suryamani.
Every Sunday Suryamani
takes the children to the forest.
As they move around, she
shows them how to recognise
the trees, the plants, and animals. Children enjoy this special
class in a forest! Suryamani always says, “To learn to read the
forest is as important as reading books.” She says,”We are forest
people (adivasis). Our lives are linked to the forests. If the forests
are not there, we too will not remain.”
20. Whose Forests?
Suryamani’s story is a true story. Suryamani is a ‘Girl Star’. ‘Girl Stars’ is a
project which tells extraordinary tales of ordinary girls, who have changed their
lives by going to school.
Teacher’s Note : Encourage children to share their experiences and imagination
about forests. Planting thousands of trees does not make a forest. It is important
to discuss the web of relationships between plants, trees and animals in a forest,
to see how they depend on each other for food, security and habitat.
Nitin Upadhaye
Teachers’ note
There should be debate on the need for – and impacts associated with – the building of big dams, roads, mining
projects, etc. It is important for learners to discuss and understand that all of these – drawing out water, oil or
extracting minerals from under the ground, or commercial fi shing from the seas – are examples of using our
‘common resources’. All these are important issues today (NCERT, 2008, p. 185).
Suryamani says:
‘To learn to read the
forest is as important
as reading books.’
She takes young
children every week
to the forests to know
themselves: ‘We are
forest people. Our
lives are linked to the
forest. If the forest is
not there we too will
not remain.’
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 81
Th e language of this textbook consciously
invokes a true narrative of human agency to
present the life-long struggle and drama of
saving forests, not merely as ‘management
of forests’ as a decontextualized ‘technoscientifi
c’ issue. Diff erent actors relate what
forests mean to them, while the text invites
learners to think about their concerns.
Refl ection and informed actions are
also encouraged in the same academic
context, leading with an original letter
written by a Grade 10 learner from a
tribal community to the chief minister
of her state.
Th e indigenous people’s sustaining
wisdom of common resources is
shared without the need to sermonize
on the conservation of natural
resources. It is worth noting that once
natural resources are introduced as a
commodity for human exploitation, it
then seems to be contrary to speak of
‘conserving’ them.
Th is textbook opens a debate on
political issues, making students
think about notions of development
and reminding them of the major
Right to Forest Act 2007.
Th e above comparison and example of good
practice shows how the topic of forest ecosystems
can be handled in two very diff erent ways. Th e
more conventional approach treats forests as
‘resources for human consumption’, enunciated
through a style of information delivery that is
largely impersonal and transactional. In contrast,
‘Whose forests?’ embeds the perspective of
sustainable development and social justice in
the text. By using a range of language styles and
registers in the narratives of diff erent people,
records such as the Forest Law and a student’s
letter, ‘Whose forests?’ invokes the agency
of human engagement to nurture students’
empathy. While language style and register
are referred to here in an Indian context, they
have the ability to resonate strongly with a
global readership embracing a great diversity
of cultural identities, environments and ‘ways
of knowing’. For textbook authors engaged in
embedding ESD, this is a useful reminder that
appropriate language register and style can
be important tools for connecting with and
developing learners’ desire to make associations
between subject-specifi c content and wider
sustainability issues.
What do you think is a forest?
What else is there other than trees?
Why does Suryamani say: ‘If forests are
not there, we too will not remain’?
Th e contractor did not allow Suryamani’s
people to go into the forest. Why?
Is there any place around your area
which you feel should be open to
everyone, but where people are not
allowed to go?
Who do you think the forest belongs to?
Right to Forest Act 2007
People who have been living in the
forests for at least 25 years have a right
over the forest land and what is grown
on it. Th ey should not be removed
from the forest. Th e work of protecting
the forest should be done by their
Gram Sabha (village body/local self
government).
Suryamani’s uncle Bhudhiyamai says:
‘Forest is our “collective bank” – not
yours or mine alone.’
Are there other things which are our
collective wealth?
So if someone uses more, everyone
would suff er?
Sikhya, a Class X girl in Orissa, wrote a letter to the chief minister.
Read a part of the letter.
‘A forest is everything for us adivasis. We can’t live away from the forests
even for a day. Government has started many projects in the name
of development – dams and factories are being built. Forests, which
are ours, are being taken away from us. Because of these projects, we
need to think where the forest people will go and what will happen to
their livelihood. Where will the lakhs of animals living in the forests
go? If there are no forests, and we dig out our lands for minerals like
aluminium, what will be left ? Only polluted air, water, and miles and
miles of barren land …’

STEP 1 Identifying learning outcomes
This example addresses sustainability issues
associated with the manufacture, disposal and
recycling of plastics. The learning outcomes
associated with this example are taken from the
Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) General
Certifi cate of Secondary Education (GCSE) for ages
14 to 16 (2016) and Advanced Level (A Level) in
Chemistry for ages 16 to 18 (2015). Boxes 5 and 6
detail the learning outcomes that underpin this
example and also show how ESD learning outcomes
may be associated with those referring to subjectspecifi
c content.
STEP 2 Developing a theme and identifying
curriculum opportunities for embedding
For the organic chemistry of plastics topic, an
appropriate central theme might be ‘an alternative
understanding of plastics as a renewable resource’.
Section 3.1 discussed the value of using a schematic
mapping tool (Figure 1) to identify associations
between curriculum specifi cations, SSIs and wider
SD issues. Figure 5 shows the application of this tool
to explore curricula for opportunities for embedding
ESD in this aspect of organic chemistry.
This approach has the dual advantage of identifying
associations between science content and SD issues
while also mining the curriculum for opportunities
for embedding ESD into a given topic. The subject
knowledge – in this case, organic chemistry – can
then be used to associate many interconnected
SD issues with the manufacture, use and disposal
of plastics.
Advisory note for authors
The examples in the following sections
(sections 4.2 to 4.4) are not intended as
exhaustive treatments of curriculum
requirements. Key learning outcomes
from current curricula have been selected
as being indicative of opportunities for
embedding ESD. It is hoped that the
prospective textbook author may note
how opportunities have been identifi ed
and expanded upon and will fi nd this a
useful guide to forays into similar
curriculum material.
4.2
Topic: Organic chemistry – plastics manufacture and uses
APPROACH: Thematic and problem-based learning (sections 3.1 and 3.2.1)
Suggested ESD learning outcomes
Learners should be able to:
1. Critically evaluate the positive and negative aspects of the
manufacture and use of plastics.
2. Use the knowledge of cracking in polymerization to
compare renewable alternatives with oil as the resource for
manufacturing plastics.
3. Use the knowledge of organic chemistry to recognise that
what society currently designates as rubbish can be redefi ned
as a resource and suggest actions to fulfi l this.

understanding of:
Learning outcomes:
1. Th e fractional distillation of crude oil.
2. Fractions as containing mixtures of hydrocarbons (alkanes) with

Plastics fulfi l many essential and benefi cial roles in
learners’ daily lives. While there are many serious
negative unsustainable impacts associated with the
manufacture and use of plastics, it is important to
acknowledge the positive infl uence they have had
on our lives. Benefi ts such as anatomical implants/
prosthetics, electrical insulators, food storage and
preservation have become essential to individual
lives and whole societies. For this reason, authors
should note that Figure 5 identifi es positive
associations (in yellow text on the right) as well as
negative associations (in red text on the left) and
emphasizes that it is not the existence of plastics
that is problematical but the manner of their use
and disposal.
As part of an extended curriculum, strong links may
be made to other areas of study, such as:
● Environmental sustainability (biology/chemistry
and ecosystem studies).
● Economic sustainability (economics/long-term
viability of resources).
‘The fractional distillation of crude oil to produce
hydrocarbons’ and ‘nomenclature and structure
of hydrocarbons’ are two topics that are common
foundation concepts in many organic international
chemistry curricula at this level. The detail of the
following example assumes that learners are
already familiar with these concepts. It builds on
this foundation to introduce the chemical processes
of addition and condensation polymerisation,
addressing the learning outcomes noted in Boxes
5 and 6 using the subject-specifi c content as a lens
through which to develop embedded ESD.

EXAMPLE 2
Organic chemistry – plastics manufacture and uses
Organic chemistry: aromatic compounds, polymers and plastics
‘an alternative understanding of plastics as a renewable resource’
Most plastics at the molecular level consist of chains of hydrocarbons (polymers) derived from the
fractional distillation of crude oil. Although natural polymers, such as rubber, have the properties of
some synthetic plastics, most plastics in use today are manufactured using oil as a source of hydrocarbons.
Plastic bags, bottles and food cartons are made of petrochemicals, harvested from oil by fractional
distillation. Th e plastics industry uses nearly 5 per cent of the world’s oil supply. Oil is a limited and nonrenewable
resource and, as a result, current plastic manufacture and use may be seen as unsustainable
with many interconnected SSIs.
Th e polymers used to manufacture plastics have been an area of rapid research and development,
shaping many consumer patterns and lifestyle choices. Great benefi ts have been gained from their use in
surgery, food hygiene, building and construction, electronics and fl ight – including space fl ight. While
there are negative issues associated with the development of modern plastics, these benefi ts must be
acknowledged in any consideration of their role in society.
Th e negligent disposal of plastic waste and its persistence in the environment is a problem that
overshadows the benefi ts of plastics usage. Its robustly non-biodegradable properties present a longterm
problem on a global scale.
Recyclability and biodegradability are two major issues. When one tonne of plastic bags is reused or
recycled, the energy equivalent of 11 barrels of oil is saved. When regarded as rubbish to be thrown away,
plastic bags are a waste of a valuable, non-renewable resource.
Advisory note for authors
The opportunity for embedding ESD here is to associate recycling and biodegradability with the chemistry of
plastic manufacture (see Box 5, learning outcome 5, ESD learning outcome 3; and Box 6, learning outcomes 1–4,
ESD learning outcomes 2 and 3).
ESD question How can chemistry address the sustainable use of plastics made from
fossil fuels?
Science question Use the internet to learn about polymers made from bioplastics – how
do they diff er from polymers made from oil?
Advisory note for authors
The opportunity to embed
ESD here is to consider what
alternatives to oil might be
used as source material in
the manufacture of synthetic
plastics (see Box 5, learning
outcomes 1–5, ESD learning
outcomes 1 and 2).
Advisory note for authors
Asking ESD questions at
this point enables learners
to use their developing
knowledge of the chemistry
underpinning the
manufacture of plastics to
understand the questions
more fully and to consider
potential solutions to the
problems posed.
ESD question What are the environmental, health and social problems associated
with current attitudes towards the disposal of used plastics?
Science question How can chemistry help to change the perception of used plastics from
rubbish to a valued renewable resource?

Hydrocarbons and polymers
Aliphatic hydrocarbons are linear chains that may have branches
with substituent atoms or molecules attached. Aromatic
hydrocarbons are cyclic hydrocarbons that may contain a
benzene ring and may also form part of a chain. Repeating
sequences of these chains are called polymers. Th ere are two
major forms of polymerization presented at this academic level:
1) addition polymerization and 2) condensation polymerization.
Th ese form the building blocks for the manufacture of plastics.
Polythene – Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)
(recycling no. 4)
Uses: fl exible wraps; rubbish and rubble bags
High Density Polyethylene (HDPE)
(recycling number 2)
Uses: drinks bottles, containers for soft foods such
as margarine, grocery bags
Th e simplest addition polymer, polyethylene is an unbranched
aliphatic polymer composed of thousands of -CH2- units
(monomers). Ethene is formed by a free radical addition
reaction. Polyethethylene (polythene) polymerization
occurs because two monomers are added to each other, with
elimination of a double bond in the monomer.
Advisory note for authors
As a foundation for the future consideration of recyclability, the
chemistry of the substitution of atoms of diff erent elements into
addition polymers to form plastic polymers (such as PVC polyvinyl
chloride or PP polypropylene) should be introduced at this point. In
other words, we are setting up the chemical foundations for evaluation
of sustainable practices, such as recyclability and biodegradability.
When an atom of chlorine is exchanged for an atom of
hydrogen in an ethene monomer, the resulting addition
polymer is polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Figure 6). If chlorine
is then substituted for a methyl group (CH3), this results
in polypropylene and the recycling number increases to 5
(see Table 3, which associates the ease of recycling common
polymers). Th e substituted molecules can produce toxic
by-products that limit recycling processes.
Condensation polymerisation
Condensation polymerization involves condensing two
monomer units together, formed by the elimination of a water
molecule once the monomers are linked. Dacron is a polyester
polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET). It is formed when
ethylene glycol (an alcohol) reacts with terephthalic acid
(a carboxylic acid) to form an ester bond, ejecting a water
molecule in a condensation reaction.
Th is type of condensation polymer combines small molecules
that contain A units (terephthalic acid) and B units (ethylene
glycol), which are joined in sequence, such as -A-B-A-BA-
B-. Th e ease with which plastics can be recycled depends
on how easy it is to reclaim constituent polymers back to
useful monomers leaving a non-toxic by-product. Th e type of
bonding and constituents of polymers greatly infl uence how
easily they may be recycled/reprocessed or transformed into a
new product. Table 3 provides an index of the recyclability and
recycling options most commonly adopted.
Figure 6: PVC and PP monomers and addition polymers
86 | SCIENCE
PET is commonly used to make drinks bottles and food packaging but recycled PET can also be made
into fi bre for carpets; fabric for t-shirts or fl eece jackets; fi bre fi lling for sleeping bags, winter coats, sheet
and thermoformed packaging; and automobile parts such as bumpers and door panels.
Plastics can be reused thermally, chemically and physically. Th ese are expensive and diffi cult processes
but recycling can be built into the production process, such as in the manufacture of polyvinylchloride
(chloroethene PVC). Chloroethene is made from ethene via 1,2-dichloroethane, which is then cracked:

ESD question
Why might it not be possible to recycle some plastics safely or easily?
Apart from chemical aspects, (discuss) what other factors might limit/
prevent eff ective recycling?
ESD question Use Table 3 to research what ‘end of life’ options exist for dealing with
those plastics that cannot be recycled?
Science question Why do you think PET has a recycling number of 1?
Science question Why do PVC and PP have two recycling numbers (3 and 5 respectively)?
What chemical factors cause this reduction in recyclability?
Biodegradability and bioplastics
A third of all plastic is designed to be thrown away (with an expected usefulness of less than one year).
Th e economics of plastic production support this unsustainable approach – it is inexpensive to produce
and durable so is frequently designed without any thought of its reuse.
Th e problem has been worsened by the global trade in cheap commodities – driven by low wages in
economically vulnerable parts of the world – as well as an insatiable appetite among consumers in
developed and emerging economies for bottled water, elaborate packaging and ‘cheap and cheerful’
goods such as toys.
To be biodegradable, a material has to be capable of decomposing naturally through exposure to
microorganisms. Biodegradation requires polymer chains to be broken into fragments small enough
for microorganisms to act upon them. Petroleum-derived plastics do not exist in nature. Consequently,
there are no microorganisms naturally adapted to decomposing them. Polyethylene polymers do not
biodegrade since long chains of -CH2- groups are almost impervious to microorganisms.
Bioplastics are made from polymers refi ned from plant material, such as corn starch, and are
biodegradable. A common bioplastic is polylactic acid (PLA).
Science question Research the structure of polylactic acid (PLA). What makes this
biodegradable?
ESD question
Drinks bottle manufacturers now replace 30 per cent of the petroleumderived
ethanol in normal PET plastic with bio-derived ethanol. Th is
does not make it biodegradable. Why not? How does this make plastic
manufacture and use more sustainable?
Science question What are weak sites in a polymer chain? How might the C=C bond be
considered a weak site? How do weak sites contribute to biodegradability?
ESD question How might weak sites be built into the manufacturing process?
Advisory note
for authors
The science and ESD
questions above are
designed to integrate
subject-specifi c content
with SD issues and
the problems are
designed to seek out
potential solutions
to the issues through
the lens of the subject
knowledge gained. For
example, the question
about how bio-derived
ethanol contributes to
sustainability through
its inclusion in PET

student to think about
how petroleum-based
resources such as
ethanol are conserved
by replacement

STEP 1 Identifying learning outcomes
This example addresses sustainability issues
associated with the curriculum topics nuclear
reactions, radiation and nuclear decay. It
employs the STSE approach, supported
by problem-based learning in the form of
calculations and integrated subject specifi c/
ESD questions. Box 7 provides the curriculumspecifi
ed learning outcomes that underpin
the example, drawn from WJEC GCE A Level in
Physics (2016).
Advisory note for authors
To fully integrate the two sets of learning outcomes noted
in Box 7, it is important to establish a good understanding
of the properties of radioactivity and radioactive particles.
Learners who have undertaken calculations of the longevity
of radiation in the environment will then have the ability
to undertake an informed evaluation of the socio-scientifi c
and sustainability issues associated with the role of nuclear
energy. The STSE approach enables such an evaluation by
presenting a range of opinions from sources in the public
domain (see below).

Topic: Physics – nuclear reactions
APPROACH: STSE and problem-based learning (calculation/discourse) (see sections 3.2 and 3.2.1)
Suggested ESD learning outcomes:
Learners should be able to:
1. Assess the role of nuclear energy as a component of sustainable
development.
2. Undertake an informed risk/benefi t comparison of nuclear versus fossil
fuels for long-term energy security.
3. Understand the importance of inter-generational issues associated with
radioactive waste disposal.
4. Assess the role of nuclear energy as a component of sustainable
development.

connections between the nature, penetration and range for ionising particles.
3. How to make allowance for background radiation in experimental measurements.
4. Th e concept of the half-life, T½.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 89
Advisory note for authors
Associated with all these issues is the control that some nations have in deciding which countries can access nuclear
science and development. It is important to note that any limitation placed on the access to such technology also
limits the positive benefi ts for those societies. The role of ESD in this context is to promote critical evaluation of the
facts and enable informed participation in decision-making processes associated with nuclear science. This example
aims to encourage students to apply their understanding of nuclear reactions to evaluate the risks associated with
nuclear energy production. Physics learning outcomes 1, 3 and 4 are addressed in the opening sections of this
example and ESD learning outcomes are fulfi lled in the later sections.
STEP 2 Identifying curriculum opportunities for
embedding
Figure 7 explores the curriculum learning outcomes
to identify opportunities for embedding ESD in
this aspect of physics. It has been noted earlier in
this chapter that a major role of ESD is to inform
debate and foster critical evaluation of SD issues,
prompting decisions and actions. Therefore, in Figure
7, nuclear energy appears on both the negative and
positive sides of the chart, indicating the uncertainty
surrounding the issue.
The nuclear issue diff ers from many other SSIs in
that decisions and actions surrounding it are almost
entirely controlled by government interests for
security (nuclear weaponry) and economic factors.
This has clear implications for a number of SD
issues at local, national and global scales, such as
international social equity, environmental protection
and the maintenance of peaceful relationships as
well as energy security and the economic wellbeing
of populations. Nevertheless, knowledge
and application of nuclear reactions provide tools
and techniques to treat cancer and undertake
diagnostic and therapeutic radiotherapy. Many other
benign applications of nuclear technology can be
identifi ed. The contrasting nature of these two very
diff erent applications of the science emphasizes
the need for greater evaluation of the sustainable
development issues associated with nuclear science
for safeguarding the present and ensuring future
well-being.

EXAMPLE 3
Physics – nuclear reactions/nuclear energy
Radiation (radioactive decay)
Th e term ‘radionuclide’ refers to an atom that is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay into another
new client. Radioactive decay (radioactivity) is the process by which the nucleus of a radionuclide loses
energy by emitting radiation.
parent nuclide → daughter nuclide + nuclear radiation
Material that spontaneously emits such radiation is considered radioactive. Nuclear radiation consists of
alpha (α) particles, beta (β) particles (high-energy electrons) and gamma radiation.
Alpha (α) particle radiation (decay):
particles consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (a charge of 2+, and mass of 4 amu.)noted as, 2
4α or
2
4HE because they are the same as a helium nucleus. Decay results in a new element being formed.
Example – Radon decays into polonium when it emits an alpha particle. Here is the equation for that
radioactive decay:
Impact on living tissues: Alpha particles are slow, have a short range in air and can be stopped by
a sheet of paper. However, their mass and speed makes them capable of substantial ionisation and in
contact with human tissue they cause much more damage than other forms of radiation.
Beta (β) particles: High-energy, fast-moving, negatively charged electrons ejected from the nucleus to
balance the loss of protons.
Example: Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon (a carbon atom with 8 neutrons instead of the
usual 6). Here is the equation for the beta decay of carbon-14 into nitrogen.
Impact on living tissues: Beta (β) particles have a longer range and more penetrating power than alphas.
Th ey can cross the skin barrier into cells directly but ionize much less strongly so cause approximately
1/20th of the damage to tissues as the same dose of alpha particles.
Gamma radiation: Very high frequency electromagnetic radiation, emitted by nuclei in an excited state
in the form of electromagnetic waves. It has no mass or charge.
Impact on living tissue: Gamma rays do not lose much energy as they travel because they do not
interact to the same extent with the matter they pass through. Gamma rays have a high penetrating
power and a very long range. Th ey can interact with cells in the body to make them non-functional and
can cause mutations and malfunctions in DNA.
Half-life
Th e activity of radioisotopes decreases exponentially with time. Aft er a given time period, the amount
that has yet to decay is halved. Th e time taken for this halving of activity is called the ‘half-life’ – the point
at which half of the original material will have decayed.

Calculate the half-life for uranium-238
Example calculation T½ = (Number of atoms) (ln(e)decay constant)
Rates of decay vary and may be predicted mathematically according to the expression:
Nt = N0 * e-kt
Nt = number of atoms
T = time
N0 = number of atoms at t0
K = decay constant (provided)
Substituting for uranium-238 results in a half-life of 4.5 x 109 years (4,500,000,000 years)
Whereas:
Polonium-212 only has a half-life of 3 x 10-7 seconds (0.000 000 3 seconds).
So ! half of the uranium-238 in existence now will still be here when the sun dies!
Nuclear energy generation and sustainability
‘Nuclear energy is recognized as being carbon-free technology for energy production. CO2 emissions
between 5–7 g per kW/h compared with coal 900 g per kW/h. Th e waste produced can be eff ectively
stored and local leakages are minimal and global eff ects are limited. Conversely, nuclear power stations
are viewed by others as accidents waiting to happen – if not in the near future then certainly at some
point in the very distant future.’ (Rowe, 2017, pp 34–41).

Science question What is enrichment?
Science question
Weapons-grade enriched uranium-235 comprises 0.72 per cent isotopic
abundance of uranium used in nuclear reactors, which is used for
enrichment as fuel and nuclear weapons. Calculate the half-life for this
element. (Answer: 704 million years!)
Science question
Plutonium-239 can be enriched more easily in the reactor of a nuclear
power plant. Calculate the half-life of this radionuclide.

Advisory note for authors
The following exercise adopts an STSE scenario to provide a platform for debate and evaluation of the viability of
nuclear energy. The articles come from diff erent cultural backgrounds (the USA and India). This exercise addresses
ESD learning outcomes 1–4 (Box 7), underpinned by curriculum learning outcomes 1 and 4. Other countries and
regions, such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, could be chosen for a culturally relevant discussion of nuclear disasters.
Alternatively, European examples may be found for discussion of the use of nuclear energy as a major provider in
France or its discontinuation in Germany.

EXERCISE
Consider the arguments presented in the two
contrasting articles presented in Boxes 8 and 9.
Use the guide questions at the end of the exercise
to formulate ideas for presentation/debate/
discussion with your school/group.
Box 8
Making the safe,
sustainable investment
It is clear that alternatives to fossil fuels must be developed
on a large scale. However, nuclear power is neither renewable
nor clean and therefore not an option. Even if one were
to disregard the waste problems, safety risks and dismal
economics, nuclear power is both too slow and too limited a
solution to global warming and energy insecurity. Given the
urgent need to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
the long lead times required for the design, permitting and
construction of nuclear reactors render nuclear power an
ineff ective option for addressing global warming.
In fact, improving energy effi ciency is the most costeff
ective and sustainable way to concurrently reduce
energy demand and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Wind
power already is less expensive than nuclear power. And
while photovoltaic power is currently more expensive than
nuclear energy, the price of electricity produced by the
sun, as with wind and other forms of renewable energy, is
falling quickly.
Conversely, the cost of nuclear power is rising. When the
very serious risk of accidents, proliferation, terrorism and
nuclear war are considered, it is clear that investment in
nuclear power as a climate change solution is not only
misguided, but also highly dangerous. As we look for
solutions to the dual threats of global warming and energy
insecurity, we should focus our eff orts on improving
energy conservation and effi ciency and expanding the use
of safe, clean renewable forms of energy to build a new
energy future for the nation.

A case for nuclear energy
India’s Civil Nuclear Power Programme uses thorium
and uranium to produce sustainable renewable
energy. Th e Union Budget of India for 2016–17
allocates Rs. 3,000 crore per annum for the next 15–
20 years. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley remarked
that this investment is required to diversify sources
of energy for the future. India currently has 21
nuclear power reactors in seven locations. Together,
they produce 5,780 MW of electric power. Two
months ago, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India
(NPCIL) signed a contract with Électricité de France
(EDF) to set up six more nuclear plants around the
country. According to the International Agency of
Atomic Energy (IAEA), in 2015 India generated a
total of 34,644 GW.h of electricity through nuclear
power. Th is amounted to just 3.53 per cent of India’s
total energy production. India should increase its
reliance on nuclear energy.
A recent report released by Greenpeace India
indicates that an average Indian was exposed to
more lung-damaging particulate pollution than a
Chinese in 2015. In both countries there has been
an increased use of fossil fuels over the last decade.
Using control technologies, China was able to reduce its particulate pollution by 17 per
cent. By contrast, pollution through particles like dirt, soot and smog increased by 13
per cent in India during the same period. According to the World Health Organisation,
pollution in major cities in India like New Delhi has worsened over the past decade.
India only has 39 air quality monitoring stations whereas China has 1,500. Nuclear
power produces no air pollution and no greenhouse gases. It seems time for India to
regard nuclear power as a serious alternative source of energy, along with wind, solar
and hydropower. Recently, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan ‘cannot do
without’ nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is clean; the price is not fl uctuating; and nuclear
is far and away the cleanest form of energy in current use. Th e International Energy
Agency (IEA) predicted in 2014 that projects relating to nuclear energy are going to
increase by 60 per cent through to 2040. Nuclear energy is under-favoured because of
outdated safety and waste disposal concerns and because it has been capital-intensive.
Super-safe small modular reactors that reprocess most of the waste should overcome
these concerns. It has been estimated that during 2016–17, 41,500 GW.h of energy will
be produced through nuclear energy, which is an increase from last year.
According to IEA, India currently has more than 250 million people without electricity
supply. Most are in rural households and live below the poverty line. Th e aim of the
government as revealed by Mr Jitendra Singh of India’s Department of Atomic Energy is
to triple the current nuclear power generation. In order to meet national and especially
rural electricity demands, the Modi government should promote nuclear energy.

STEP 1 Issue identifi cation and association with
curriculum requirements
Issue: Declining bee populations
Textbook authors should note that this issue relates
to the wider curriculum requirements of ecosystem
dynamics, food security and agricultural practice.
It engages well with learning outcomes taken from
Canada’s Grade 7 science curriculum for British
Columbia (Box 10), where the ecosystem, biodiversity
and food web concepts feature strongly. (These are
also common ideas in science curricula worldwide.)
Box 10
Learning outcomes for the elementary
science curriculum, Ministry of Education,
Province of British Columbia, Canada
Life science: habitats and communities (2005)
Learners should be able to:
1. Analyze the roles of organisms as part of
interconnected food webs, populations,
communities and ecosystems.
2. Assess survival needs and interactions between
organisms and environment.
3. Assess the requirements for sustaining healthy
local ecosystems.
STEP 2 Connecting issues with learning
outcomes
When introduced in textbooks, this issue can be
connected/expanded to ESD learning outcomes,
such as those noted in the lower half of Box 11
(GM crop monoculture and use of pesticides and
insecticides), while maintaining strong links with
curriculum specifi cations. The textbook should also
seek to support such associations with sciencebased
research outcomes, which may be evaluated
by the learners and which increase the validity of the
points of view forwarded. For example: ‘Researchers
have noted that global warming also impacts on
bumblebee habitats and results in bee population
decline.’ Figure 8 shows how the generic model
introduced in section 3.2.1 adapts to the declining
bee population scenario in this example.
The declining bee population and loss of colonies
is a global ecological and economic concern. It is
recognized as an indicator of ecosystem disruption
that is potentially attributable to a number of
unsustainable land management and agricultural
practices.
4.4
Topic: Ecosystem dynamics, plant and animal interactions
APPROACH: Issue-centric STSE using storyline and problem-based learning
In contrast to the previous examples in section 4, this example shows the potential of the STSE model for
embedding ESD in textbooks using an issue-centric entry point while still making strong associations with
curriculum requirements.
Suggested ESD learning outcomes:
Learners should be able to:
1. Understand the dependence of food
security on natural systems.
2. Appreciate the impacts that industrialized
agricultural practices have on original land
and methods of agriculture.
3. Evaluate human impacts on local
ecosystems and expand this to a
global perception.

and issues
STEP 3 Identifying curriculum opportunities
for embedding ESD
Most curricula make clear that scientifi c inquiry
and investigation skills are essential 21st century
competencies for learners. The ability to evaluate
SD issues in an informed manner should be similarly
considered. The investigative skills associated
with the exploration of sustainable development
issues integrate well with problem-based learning
approaches. Learners recognize the problem, plan
for problem solving, process their plans and arrive at
conclusions or solutions. While Figure 8 clarifi es the
relationships between ESD and the other domains
of the model, it does not give clear guidance on
how curriculum opportunities may be identifi ed and
engaged with. Figure 9 employs the same mapping
tool that was used in previous examples to address
these shortcomings. It also makes clear how this
technique creates a central focal point for wrapping
science topics around related and relevant issues.
Advisory note for authors
The ‘story’ in this example is close and relevant to the everyday life experiences of Canadian students living in rural
areas. The original storyline was developed in the context of British Columbia to encourage learners to understand the
local bee population problem as it relates to their everyday lives. This context may need to be adapted to relate to the
lives of learners who reside in urban or other diff erent geographical environments.
Textbook authors might wish to consider this key question
What are the origins of the issues identifi ed and what embedded material will enable learners to identify with these
and address them in their own research? Here, the powerful role of the textbook lies in its ability to align the story and
learners’ inquiry skills with the science curriculum being followed.
• Disruption of natural
ecosystem function
• Loss of soil integrity
• Food web disruption
• Loss of food security
Curriculum opportunities
• Living organisms and their surroundings
• Reproductive biology of plants and insects
• Interconnectedness of food webs,

EXAMPLE 4
Elementary science (biology – habitats and communities)
Advisory note for authors
Sequence for topic structure using STSE scenario approach with problem-based learning (Figure 7).
1. Introduce science concepts. Understanding of the SSIs raised by the story is informed by the curriculum shown in
Box 11, in this case, concepts such ecosystem function, sexual reproduction of fl owering plants, food webs and
insect pollination. The curriculum-based science can then be translated into research-informed identifi cation
of SSIs and wider SD issues. This gives learners an academic framework with which to contextualize the story/
scenario.
2. Present the STSE story/problem context.
3. Instigate investigation. Inclusion of students’ inquiry activities in the textbook topic is important to enable learners
to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This may be undertaken as a series of questions designed
to promote investigative skills as preparation for debate/discussion.
Research activity: Read the story in Box 11 and think about the issues raised.
Box 11
Bee populations decline
Storyline: Th e broad geography and climate of British Columbia, Canada, means agricultural
activities are abundant. Th ere are many farms around this region and British Columbians
are heavily involved in agriculture, visiting farms to harvest produce (for example, cherries),
gardening, etc. Th ere are also many private and commercial bee keepers, who keep hives in
their gardens.
Th is story begins with children playing around their garden, which contains several bee
hives. Th e children love to eat honey from their hives and are curious about how their parents
harvest it. Th ey hear their parents saying that the amount of honey they harvest is declining.
Th e children ask why and the parents tell them there are fewer bees in the area than there have
been in the past. Th e children begin to wonder why the bees are in decline and so begin to
research the bee population.
Th ey ask: ‘Why is this happening?’
Equally this approach may be scaled up to relate to an older cohort using the same techniques. Box 12 shows an
example of a related but more advanced article considering the same subject. A series of curriculum-focused science
and ESD questions follow to promote critical thinking skills and consideration of wider SD issues informed by the
curriculum-led science being studied.

Pesticides linked to bee decline for fi rst time in countrywide
fi eld study
Alison Benjamin, Th e Guardian, Th ursday 20 August 2015
Landscape-wide research by a UK government agency on oilseed rape fi elds in England and
Wales shows links between neonicotinoids (pesticides) and honeybee colony losses. A new
study provides the fi rst evidence of a link between neonicotinoid pesticides and escalating
honeybee colony losses on a landscape level. Th e study found the increased use of a pesticide,
which is linked to causing serious harm in bees worldwide, as a seed treatment on oilseed
rape in England and Wales over an 11-year period correlated with higher bee mortality
during that time.
Th e total area of land planted with oilseed rape in England and Wales more than doubled
from 293,378 hectares (724,952 acres) to 602,270 hectares over that time and the number of
seeds treated with the imidacloprid pesticide increased from less than 1 per cent of the area
planted in 2000 to more than 75 per cent of the area planted with oilseed rape by 2010.
Th e honeybee is the most important commercial pollinator, globally responsible for
pollinating at least 90 per cent of commercial crops. Th ey are the most frequent fl ower
visitor to oilseed rape. Th e report’s authors said: ‘As long as acute toxins remain the basis of
agricultural pest control practices, society will be forced to weigh the benefi ts of pesticides
against their collateral damage. Nowhere is this tension more evident than in the system with
the world’s most widely used insecticide, the world’s most widely used managed pollinator
and Europe’s most widely grown mass fl owering crop.’
Th e UK government has always maintained that neonicotinoid pesticides do not threaten
bees. It has laid the blame for high honeybee losses on the parasitic varroa mite, which
spreads viruses, and wet summers that prevent bees from foraging.
A European-wide two-year ban on a number of pesticides linked to bee deaths came into
force in December 2013. Last month, the UK government temporarily overturned the ban
on two pesticides on about 5 per cent of England’s oilseed rape crop. Th e Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Aff airs (Defra) said the emergency authorisation did not apply
to imidacloprid. It added that the use of this particular pesticide had fallen dramatically in
the UK, down from 43,900 kilos in 2005 to just 7,250 kilos in 2013.
A Defra spokesperson said: ‘Th is paper provides evidence that neonicotinoid seed treatments
can reduce the need for more pesticide use on crops. Large-scale fi eld studies are needed
to fully understand their eff ects on the environment. Th e government makes decisions on
pesticides based on the best available scientifi c evidence.’
Paul de Zylva, senior nature campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the Fera study added
to the growing evidence showing the harm neonicotinoid pesticides do to pollinators. ‘Th e
pesticide industry can’t continue to maintain that there is no eff ect of their products on
honeybees and wild bumblebees and solitary bees,’ he said.
Activity for older learners: Prepare answers to these questions for discussion with your class groups and teachers.
ESD question Would all countries be aff ected equally by declining bee populations?
Science question How would the use of GM crops be aff ected by declining bee populations?
Give reasons for your answer.
Science question What biological factors other than pesticides might be responsible for bee population decline?
ESD question If the use of pesticides was discontinued or reduced, how do you think this would aff ect world
agriculture and global food security?
ESD/science
question
What biological alternatives to the use of pesticides might be able to be used to protect agricultural
systems from attack from insect populations?

Final considerations
5.0
Researchers have found that many learners develop stereotypical views of science as boring, Eurocentric
and male dominated (Johnston, 2013; Özel, 2012; Archer et al, 2010; Tucker-Raymond et al, 2007; Zhai,
Jocz and Tan, 2014).
In this chapter we have noted that, in many cases, school science is disconnected from learners’ everyday lives
and fails to portray a world with which they have a personal affi nity. Portraits of scientists in the media, such as
children’s books and magazines, also present certain stereotypes. In the interest of putting our own house in
order, it is important to note that there still appears to be a male bias among those learners who defi ne science
as the natural home for their studies, personal development and career aspirations. Additionally, in many parts
of the world, poverty exerts pressures that exclude many minority groups from this important area of human
endeavour.
The guiding principles, models and strategies considered in this chapter all focus on issues as they are defi ned
under the overarching term ‘sustainable development’ (United Nations 2015). Some issues can be recognized
more easily than others in the embedding process and some are more easily addressed than others. The
mapping tools used in the examples provide opportunities to develop extended associations and relevance
in the areas of citizenship, social justice and gender/social equality. It would take many examples to ensure full
awareness of all the issues valid under this umbrella term and we hope that those included here will provide
useful templates for textbook authors to follow.
A legitimate criticism of any example might be that it is limited by addressing a specifi c suite of SD issues to
the exclusion of others. In the case of the science examples presented in this chapter, there is inevitably a
focus on physical impacts. It should be acknowledged, however, that where these impacts occur, there is a
range of associated economic, sociological and political pressures that have their origins in these impacts. We
acknowledge the diffi culties and challenges that science textbook authors might face in embedding ESD and
pay due respect in advance to their eff orts. The authors of this chapter in no way claim to have all the answers.
However, on the basis of our joint experience, we hope the discussion and examples in this chapter highlight
issues too often neglected. Embedding ESD in (science) textbooks has been the central focus of the chapter.
However, after engaging with this closely, we hope that it becomes clear that the next logical step is to develop
a fully integrated curriculum embedding ESD as a major step towards supporting future generations achieve
more sustainable practices and viewpoints.
Science needs to be
more inclusive of
marginalized and
minority groups

Geography is
used for wars
but has a huge
potential to
foster peace
WHILE GEOGRAPHY CAN be thought of in terms
of knowing the names of capital cities, it can also
be seen as a way of (re)organizing the world. It can
draw straight and arbitrary borders but can also
make sense of complex systems at a glance. It can
reinforce existing power relationships or question
them. Geography is used for wars but has a huge
potential to foster peace. It can help us understand
local issues as well as highlight their links to global
phenomena. Geography can be looked at as a static
set of encyclopaedic knowledge or as a dynamic way
of seeing, thinking and contributing to the world. The
variety in understandings of geography is mirrored in
the variety of approaches to geographical education,
infl uenced by a number of diverse pedagogical
approaches. This chapter addresses this variety and
off ers ways in which geographical education can
contribute to educating for sustainable development,
peace and global citizenship. It focuses on related
implications for textbooks and discusses ways of
embedding ESD, used as an umbrella term.
The fi rst section outlines ways in which geography
can contribute to sustainable development (SD),
peace and global citizenship and their related
educations. The second section examines this link at
a more concrete level and presents tools for authors
wishing to embed ESD into geography textbooks.
Two checklists (presented as ‘spider-webs’) have
been developed to off er guidance when shaping
geographical content for ESD and for elaborating
geographical tasks in coherence with ESD. This
tandem relationship between content1 and pedagogy
is a central issue within the chapter and will be looked
at again in the third section, which focuses on new,
potential and existing embedding examples.
The understanding of SD, ESD and embedding aligns
with the one presented in the Introductory chapter:
● The option to work according to a weak
(anthropocentric) or strong (biocentric) conception
of SD is left open because an integrative conception
of SD has been chosen for this work (see p. 16).
● When embedding is concerned, we follow the idea
of a strong ESD structure (see p. 17).
● ESD is seen as a ‘built-in approach’ according to
Sterling’s defi nition (2004, in Lotz-Sisitka et al,
2015, p. 73), tending to a ‘whole system re-design’
(see p. 18).
‘When you meet people at a party and tell them you’re a geographer, they tend to
ask you about distant places, capital cities and longest rivers. In my experience, they
rarely ask you about globalisation, sustainability, inequality or the other big issues
about which geographers actually have a lot to say.’
(Jackson, 2006, p. 199)
1 We understand content as a combination of factual knowledge and a way of organizing it along concepts related to the discipline (see sections
1.1.3 and 1.2.1). Other aspects of knowledge, such as procedural knowledge (for example, reading a map), are included in the use of the word
‘knowledge’ and are addressed, for example, in section 1.2.2).
106 | GEOGRAPHY
What has geography to do with
sustainable development, global
citizenship and peace – and what
does this mean for education?
1.0
1.1
Geographies and
their contribution to
sustainable development
We will look at three ways in which geography has
the potential to contribute to SD:
● In combining physical and human geography.
● In using the complementarity of diverse
approaches to spatial variability.
● In considering ‘core concepts’ of geography for
organizing geographical facts.
1.1.1
Combining physical and human
geographies for SD
A fi rst distinction within geography is the one
between physical and human geography, with both
looking at the spatial dimension of studied subjects.
Diff erent areas of the world may set their focus on
one or the other. However, there is now a broad
consensus that contemporary geography should
aim to investigate the interrelation between human
and physical geography, as made clear in the 2016
International Charter on Geographical Education:
‘Geography is the study of Earth and its natural and
human environments, [it] enables the study of human
activities and their interrelationships and interactions
with environments from local to global scales’
(IGU-CGE, 2016, p. 4).
This ‘bridging’ theoretical position equips geography
to look at production and development from the
perspective of ecological and social sustainability,
and not merely from an economist’s view of
conservation of resources for economic production.
This gives it the potential to contribute to a strong
vision of SD. Studying the interrelations between
ecosystems and societies, which are sometimes
considered as being a part of the ecosystems, also
helps to see our planet and its components as a
system with imbricated subsystems. In other words,
‘Earth is seen as a human-environment-system from
a spatial perspective’ (Rempfl er and Uphues, 2012,
p. 9). This encourages us to acknowledge the
intricacies of our relationships with societies across
the world, and our dependence on the environment. It
shows the necessity of stewardship and collaboration
across cultures to solve global challenges, and
encourages us to refl ect on the consequences of our
choices and actions on our living systems, which, in
turn, infl uence us. This ‘bridging’ position also allows
us to look closely at natural ecosystems as models of
sustainability and to see potential parallels in the way
our societies work.
1.1.2
Describing, understanding and
shaping the world for SD
The second part of the defi nition of geography given
in the 2016 International Charter on Geographical
Education states that: ‘While geography often bridges
natural and social sciences, it is pre-eminently the
discipline that deals with spatial variability, i.e. that
phenomena, events and processes vary within and
According to the classical Greek etymology,2 geography may be understood as the intellectual eff ort of ‘writing’
the ‘earth’. Reinfried and Hertig (2011, p. 5) acknowledge that ‘basically, the object of geography is the earth or
earth surface’. However, they underline that beyond this general defi nition, understandings of geography can
vary. This is stressed by Morgan (2013, p. 274) when stipulating that ‘rather than a singular Geography, there exist
multiple geographies’ as the discipline has moved ‘through a sequence of paradigms, from a focus on regional
geography through a range of quantitative, humanist, structuralist approaches, lately heavily infl uenced by
post-modern cultural thinking’ (Rawding, 2013, p. 288). The aim of this section is not to close a debate that
has endured for centuries, but to point out general trends and possible articulations to illustrate how diff erent
geographies can be of interest to SD. The second part of this section discusses the implications this has for a
geographical education contributing to ESD. The refl ections are articulated around elements from the 2016
International Charter on Geographical Education, a document that has a broad acceptance worldwide.

between places and therefore should be regarded as
an essential part of the education of all citizens in all
Societies,’ (IGU-CGE 2016, p. 4).
Geographical discourse around spatial variability
can be articulated in three ways of thinking about
the world. They can be considered ‘at the same time
successional and complementary in their mindset’,
(Rétaillé, 2000, in Reinfried and Hertig, 2011 p. 8).
These three ways can be summarized as follows
(Rétaillé, 2000; Varcher, 2008; Hertig, 2011; all in
Reinfried and Hertig, 2011):
● One perspective sees the world as a planet whose
parts are localized, named and characterized,
with topographical maps as a starting point
(idiographic approach). The focus is on describing
the specifi cities of these parts in relation to others.
This perspective can be related to approaches
prevailing in the 1950s (see Hartshorne, 1959)
and they still have an infl uence today within
regional geography. ‘Each place being unique
in its characteristics, the outcomes of similar
environmental and socioeconomic processes
may vary between places, and similar problems
may require diff erent strategies in diff erent
places’, (Maud, 2015, p. 19). For example, a densely
populated city in a semi-arid climatic zone does
not organize energy consumption in the same
way as a city with a low population density in a
cold area. Therefore, they will look for adapted
solutions when aiming to reduce the emission of
greenhouse gases. This perspective contributes
to understanding local issues in depth and
determining how they may relate to issues
elsewhere, therefore helping to shape locally
relevant alternatives for SD.
● Another perspective sees the world as an entity that
is measured and organized (nomothetic approach).
The aim is to identify localization rules and spatial
organization patterns to highlight regularities and
invariants within space, be it patterns of polarization
(for example, concentration of services in cities) or
diff usion (for example, population movements).
This can relate to the quantitative revolution of
geography as initiated by the work of Schaefer
(1953). Quantitative data, modelling and thematic
maps are core tools within this approach, having
gained power with the improvements in remote
sensing and geographical information systems.
As ‘spatial distributions have environmental,
economic, social and political [causes and]
consequences’ (Maud, 2015, p. 19), it is of interest
for SD to look at them. For example, in Australia
‘the spatial concentration of the population into
just fi ve cities has environmental consequences,
because of the concentration of pollution or
the construction of water storages, and political
consequences, because of the infl uence of urban
voters on governments’ (ibid). This is of relevance
to SD because it helps in identifying unsustainable
schemes and their reproduction at a large scale,
prioritizing areas of intervention, identifying
leverages for action and analyzing possible eff ects
of change.
● A third perspective sees a world whose meaning
and fi nality is to be explored. It looks at ‘actors and
their intentions and thereby draws the cultural,
symbolic and political dimensions of space and of
spatial facts to our attention’ (Hertig, 2011; Varcher
2008, all in Reinfried and Hertig, 2011, p. 8). This
perspective, gathering humanistic and cultural
approaches to geography, is articulated along
three closely linked aspects:
– The study of place allows us to identify dynamics
of power and social relations present in society.
Cities, for example, would be studied in terms
of social justice and environmental issues (see
Harvey, 1973). The fact that some parts of a city
lack basic infrastructure, inducing pollution and
illness through the absence of waste-treatment
plants, shows unequal access to services
and resources among the city’s population.
Therefore, looking at ways in which a place is
organized can help in identifying unsustainable
(or sustainable) practices and can address issues
of social justice.
– People give spaces meanings based on
their subjective, social, economic, cultural,
political and ethical experiences (Tuan, 1974
and 1975; Massey, 1994 and 1994b; Frémont,
2005; Hubbard, 2005). A forest has a diff erent
meaning for a community living in it and seeing
its spiritual dimension than for a corporation
wanting to exploit wood for economic purposes.
Both actors will interact with the forest in
diff erent ways. Understanding the meaning
given to a place helps to identify more or less
sustainable forms of human-nature or humanhuman
interactions and gives insight into the
perspectives of people aff ected by or carrying
out unsustainable practices.
– Similarly, actors shape a place according
to their needs, representations, values and
worldviews, as well as their power in society
(Cosgrove and Daniel, 1988; Dalby, 1991; Ó
Tuathail, 1996). Therefore, they have the power
to reinforce narratives, bias, stereotypes and
power relationships – or to challenge them in
presenting alternative ways of shaping places
(Dalby, 1991; Ó Tuathail, 1996). Planning to build
a supermarket in an industrial area inaccessible
by public transport shows diff erent logic and
values to planning a network of small shops in
a densely populated area. It also has a diff erent
impact on the environment and society. In
other words, the representation of what is
‘adequate’ planning diff ers and is related to the
societal and individual values given to space
To describe
specifi cities of
localized places, to
identify localization
rules and spatial
organization patterns
and to look at actors
and their intentions
when shaping space
are three facets of
geography that
contribute to a better
understanding of
SD-related issues

Geography of products
Contribution to SD
and its components, and to power relationships
between actors within this given space. The
consideration of values and power within spatial
action makes a core contribution to SD because
it deals with issues of equity, justice and peace.
In all these three aspects, actors are not considered
neutral and can be seen as individuals or as
collectives, such as enterprises, local communities
and organizations from civil society, governments
or supra-national government bodies. Audigier
(2011) describes this continuum between the
individual and the collective as social scales. This is
crucial to SD because it looks for a balance between
individual needs and common interests and aims to
set sustainability-driven priorities among diverging
interests. It is also of relevance to citizenship in
general, as mentioned in the 2016 charter, as well as
for global citizenship, social justice and peace.
In brief, focusing on actors and related spatial
actions while looking at place and space as
indicators of social organization and worldviews
can help to identify (un)sustainable practices and
underlying values that may lead to inequities and
resource depletion. It therefore questions the
roots of (un)sustainable practices and beliefs and
addresses confl icting interests while having the
potential to help identify blocking or supportive
mechanisms for SD. In the same logic, geography
also has the power to suggest alternative ways of
organizing place and space in coherence with SD.
This implies that geography may have an evident
political connotation and is strongly determined
by socio-economical, cultural, ideological and even
personal contexts (see also section 1.2.3). On the
other hand, geography has the power to infl uence
these contexts. In this sense, a geography that
follows the vision of SD has the power to reshape
places and spaces and create alternative worlds.
Figure 1:
Complementary
approaches to spatial
variability – moving from
a descriptive geography to
a geography of processes
Figure 1 illustrates these three ways of seeing the
world. It also shows that the relevance of geography
to SD is compromised if the descriptive level is the
only level considered because taking patterns and
processes into account is of crucial importance for a
better understanding of SD-related issues.
1.1.3
Organizing spatial knowledge
along core concepts
Underlying concepts common to all ‘geographies’
can be identifi ed in the defi nition of geography given
by the 2016 International Charter on Geographical
Education: place, space, scale and environment.3
Environment is understood as ‘our living and nonliving
surroundings’ (Geographical Association,
2012, p. 4) and these are addressed explicitly. They
are considered to be ‘core concepts’ of the discipline
(Matthews and Herbert, 2008, in Morgan, 2013) and
seen as ‘important ideas’ or ‘integrative concepts’ that
help to organize geographical knowledge (Reinfried
and Hertig, 2011; Geographical Association, 2012;
Brooks, 2013). Other candidates include location
(Geographical Association, 2012) or ‘time’ (Taylor,
2008, in Brooks, 2013).
PLACE is a part of the earth’s surface, or a location,
given a unique character by the human and natural
phenomena present in it (Reinfried and Hertig, 2011).
A place is ‘given meaning by the people who live in
and use it’ (Lambert, 2011, p. 262).
SPACE is a ‘three-dimensional uninterrupted surface
of the earth on which everything is located and
3 Interaction or interrelations are sometimes used more or less as
synonyms for ‘environment’.
A geography that
follows the vision of
SD has the power to
reshape places and
spaces and create
alternative worlds

(Australian curriculum).4
SCALE is a way of looking at ‘geographical phenomena
and problems at diff erent spatial levels, such as local
scale, and global scale (spatial scale)’ (Australian
curriculum).
ENVIRONMENT in the wide sense ‘is the result of the
interaction of physical and human features creating
the conditions and resources on which life on earth
depends’ (Lambert, 2011, p. 162).
Talking about these core concepts, Lambert (2004)
distinguishes between the ‘vocabulary’ of geography,
seen as geographical facts, which are mobilized by
good ‘grammar’, seen as geographical concepts, in
order to make sense of the world. He therefore insists
on the power of thinking geographically, which is
an approach gaining in acceptance (see also 1.2.2).
Jackson (2006) goes a step further in affi rming that
it is crucial to see these concepts in relation to one
another. For example, linking place with space
helps us recognize the interaction between local
specifi cities and broader dynamics. And looking
at an issue at diff erent scales while identifying
their connection to one another helps us change
perspective and identify implications at certain
scales not visible at others. The interrelated nature
of these core concepts contributes to the holistic
approach promoted by SD and global citizenship.
Both are strongly rooted in local processes while also
considering ‘the bigger picture’. Through the study
of geography, therefore, we can better understand
the (un)sustainability of our individual and collective
actions and are able to interpret the spatial relevance
of social, environmental and political changes at local
and global scales in our daily lives.
The idea of process mentioned in the defi nition also
implies that time plays a role. Thus, time is not only
an historical concept but also a geographical one
(Taylor, 2008, in Brooks, 2013). It enables us to look at
the evolution of a landscape and the related values
of a society. For example, large roads entering cities
illustrate the central status of cars in the western
world of the 1960s. This way of structuring space
is still visible at present, although urban planning
now tends to set a clearer focus on public transport.
Looking at evolutions in space over time echoes the
fact that SD is about intergenerational equity.
These elements are refl ected in the summary
below. They infl uence the understanding of how
geographical education contributes to ESD, as
discussed in the next section.
SUMMARY
A geography contributing to SD is one that:
● Combines human and physical geography by
looking at the interaction and interdependence
between societies and their natural environment
at diff erent spatial scales, thus having a holistic
approach inherent to SD.
● Combines the description of places, the analysis
of patterns in space and the study of spatial
processes shaped by actors. It does this in such
a way as to ‘read’ the world to gain a better
understanding of sustainability issues and to
‘write’ the world in proposing alternative ways of
organizing space for SD.
● Refers to core elements common to all geographies
that underline specifi c contributions the discipline
can make to SD (for example, looking at various
spatial scales).

Implications for
geography education and
its contribution to ESD
Whether it is through appreciating the beauty of
Earth, the immense power of Earth-shaping forces or
the often ingenious ways in which people create their
living in diff erent environments and circumstances,
studying geography helps people to understand
and appreciate how places and landscapes are
formed, how people and environments interact, the
consequences that arise from our everyday spatial
decisions, and Earth’s diverse and interconnected
mosaic of cultures and societies. Geography therefore
is a vital subject and resource for 21st century
citizens living in a tightly interconnected world. It
enables us to face questions of what it means to live
sustainably in this world. Geographically educated
individuals understand human relationships and
their responsibilities to both the natural environment
and to others. Geographical education helps people to
learn how to exist harmoniously with all living species.
International Charter on Geographical Education,
2016, p. 5
This description of geography’s contribution to
education introduces the idea that geographical
education has an explicit link to SD and an implicit
link to global citizenship and peace. The evident
contribution of geography to SD discussed in the
previous section has created a close relationship
between geography education and ESD. Several
national school systems and curricula already
promote the integration of SD (as content) or ESD
(as a pedagogical concept) into school geography,
and many ESD experts are geographers. Smith
(2013, p. 257) says: ‘It is the geography subject area
within the school curriculum that is often given
major responsibility for teaching and learning
about sustainable development.’ In other words,
geographical education has the potential to make
a core contribution to ESD, depending upon
which type of geography and which pedagogy are
implemented.
This potential, however, is under-exploited. The
developments in geographical education over the
past six decades have introduced a theoretical and
pedagogical focus on issues such as SD, ecological
and social relationships and responsible citizenship
(Soltman, 2006). However, it is taking time for these
changes to be broadly refl ected in school textbooks
(Sunny, 2006). Some examples that harness this
potential have emerged (see last section), but often
the type of geography that is promoted still focuses
on a descriptive ‘capes and bays’ approach using
methods that are not favourable to ESD.
To exploit that potential more systematically, the
following section discusses how geographical
education can contribute to ESD by looking at
two important aspects of textbooks: the type of
geographical content that is worked on in the
document, and the kind of pedagogy applied.
1.2.1
What type of geographical content favours ESD?
Based on the conclusions of section 1, geographical content favouring ESD focuses on the interrelation
of natural and human systems, looks at the diff erent facets of spatial variability (including the role of
actors) and articulates spatial knowledge around key geographical concepts.
Example for the topic of natural hazards
An examination of the topic ‘natural hazards’ (seen as natural phenomena aff ecting human societies)
shows how a textbook writer can contribute to ESD through content. A key element in addressing the
topic is the understanding of the natural phenomenon or risk. For example, how volcanism works, why
it is mostly located at the limit of tectonic plates, the diff erent types of volcanism and so on. Another
fundamental aspect of the topic is the consideration of the vulnerability of the societies confronting the
risk. By studying societies that have settled around volcanoes and coped with the related risks, we are
able to identify the diff erent factors infl uencing the degree of vulnerability. Th is would be a classical way
of tackling the topic.
Looking more precisely at the interrelation of societies and their natural environments can introduce a
more critical perspective relevant to ESD. Natural hazards are oft en considered in terms of fatalities and
the damage aff ecting human populations. In this sense, humans are seen as victims of ‘nature’. However,
a close look at the human-nature interrelation shows that human activity sometimes intensifi es the risk.
Whereas landslides have a natural dimension (geology, slope, heavy rainfall or type of vegetation), the
related risks can be enhanced by human activities such as deforestation or the digging of a road, which
destabilize the fragile equilibria of a slope. Human activities can also reduce the mitigating eff ect of
ecosystems in the face of certain risks. If mangroves along a coastline are destroyed to develop tourismfocused
infrastructure and boost a local economy, the natural protection they off ered against tsunamis is
Geographical

potential to make
a core contribution
to ESD, depending
upon which type
of geography and
which pedagogy is
implemented.
But this potential is
under-exploited

reduced, increasing vulnerability. In the case of the landslide and the tsunami, the hazards can no longer
be considered only ‘natural’. Th is holistic understanding of natural hazards is of central relevance when
refl ecting such issues to steer them toward sustainability.
A textbook writer can also use geography to contribute to ESD by looking at the topic of natural hazards
through the lens of actors, thus focusing on vulnerability and risk management. Issues of inequality can
be addressed by looking at reasons why an earthquake has more impact in Haiti than in Japan, or why
certain groups within a population are more exposed to the risk of a volcanic eruption. Oft en, a lack
of alternatives pushes poorer people to settle in risky places. In the case of an emergency evacuation of
a city, under-privileged groups might be exposed to risk for longer if the government fails to organize
public transport for people who do not own cars. Th ey may also lack access to important information
communicated through means not accessible to everyone. Th is highlights how socio-economic issues
of resources, power and governance infl uence vulnerability. Vulnerability can also increase according to
the meaning people give to a certain place, which might explain why they are prepared to live in riskier
areas. Understanding these issues helps highlight alternative options for managing risk by taking into
consideration people’s beliefs and elements of social justice, global citizenship and peace.
1.2.2
Which features of
geographical pedagogies
contribute to ESD?
Geographical investigation both satisfi es and
nourishes curiosity. Geographical perspectives help
deepen understanding of many contemporary
challenges such as climate change, food security,
energy choices, overexploitation of natural resources
and urbanization. Teaching geography serves
several vital educational goals. Building on people’s
own experiences, learning geography helps them
to formulate questions, develop their intellectual
skills and respond to issues aff ecting their lives. It
introduces them not only to key 21st century skills
but also to distinctive investigative tools such as
maps, fi eldwork and the use of powerful digital
communication technologies such as Geographic
Information Systems.
International Charter on Geographical Education,
2016, p. 5
Three central elements of geographical education
can be highlighted from this paragraph: the
importance of ‘investigation’, the idea of having
a ‘geographical perspective’ on current issues
and the evidence of ‘building on people’s own
experience’.
The central role of investigation
Investigation has played a central role in geography
since the origins of the discipline, leading to ‘a
practical and empirical approach concerned to
collect and present the facts’ (Matthews and Herbert,
2008, in Morgan, 2013, p. 279). A reliance on selforganized
methods of acquiring knowledge is
crucial to ESD, so giving learners the opportunity
to practise geographical inquiry is one of the ways
in which geographical education contributes to
ESD. This includes questioning a spatial reality to
identify its central issues, gathering information
from a variety of sources, practising fi eldwork,
evaluating the information gathered, putting it into
perspective with established ‘scientifi c’ knowledge
and communicating the fi ndings (see DGfG, 2012;
Smith, 2013; Ministry of Education Singapore,
2016). Fieldwork, as an important characteristic of
geographical investigation, encourages learners
to explore elements of their everyday lives and
surroundings, thus developing a link to local issues
In this example, content is organized around
geographical concepts such as interrelations (human
impact on nature and vice versa), place (looking at
hazards in Haiti and Japan, or at the meaning given to
a place exposed to a risk), space (volcanism happens
mostly along the limits of tectonic plates, governance
and economic power infl uence vulnerability) and
scales (equity in risk management at local and
international levels within societies). Keeping these
in mind and highlighting their relationships is one
specifi c contribution of geographical education to
the complexity inherent in ESD. It rejoins the idea
that addressing a topic in such a holistic way is a
base for training the system-competence of learners.
Students have to be able to ‘read’ and ‘write’ the
world as a system that is composed of sub-systems
linked by a complex set of relationships (see Rempfl er
and Upuhes, 2012). The German Association for
Geography (DGfG, 2007) considers this system
competence to be the core of geographical education
and sees it as making a central contribution to ESD,
saying: ‘Learners can only participate in SD if they
recognize and understand complex and global
relationships’ (Riess and Mischo, 2010, and Rost
et al, 2003, in Rempfl er and Upuhes, 2012). The
geographical content presented in the textbook has
to contribute to this system competence.
We will now address the fact that school geography
has, in some parts of the world, built up a distinctive
pedagogy that contributes to ESD (Smith, 2013).
Giving learners
the opportunity to
practise geographical
inquiry is one of
the ways in which
geographical
education
contributes to ESD
112 | GEOGRAPHY
and contributing to a sense of ownership and
responsibility vital to ESD. Maps and graphics can
be a basis for inquiry, as well as a result of it. They
are powerful tools in understanding the spatial
dimension of an issue as well as synthesizing
and communicating complex and sometimes
contradicting data. This emphasis on the visual
synthesis of geography makes a key contribution to
tackling the complex issues inherent in ESD and is
strengthened by the emergence of remote sensing
and geographic information systems. Moreover, as
maps and other visuals refl ect the worldviews of
the people who made them, a critical point of view
on how an issue is represented can be developed.
This encourages a critical reading of sources of
information.
Textbook authors need to adopt a pedagogy that
works on this kind of procedural knowledge. This
should include tasks that enable learners to identify
a geographical issue, interoperate and create maps,
work with methodologies to gather information
and then compare the information they have
collected with stabilized knowledge. Figure 3 gives
an example from an existing textbook, showing the
steps to be taken for leading an inquiry in the field
(see also fifth ESD-compatible existing example in
section 3.2).
Learning to think as a geographer
The importance of ‘having a geographical
perspective’, as mentioned in the 2016 charter,
echoes a shift in geographical education from
‘learning about geography’ towards ‘learning to think
as a geographer’ (Lambert, 2004; GA, 2009; Reinfried
and Hertig, 2011). To plan a new district on a map in
groups and to observe that a place is shaped in various
ways according to the values of those who plan it; to
debate the effi cacy of using biofuel according to its
impact on societies and the environment at diff erent
spatial scales; and to identify an interrelation
between the introduction of a new technology and
a change in surrounding ecosystems are tasks that
mobilize geographical facts while training students
to ‘reason geographically’. Learners are progressively
able to mobilize the core concepts of the discipline to
analyze a situation from a geographical perspective,
which echoes the idea of system competence seen
in the preceding sub-section. Training for such
a geographical perspective contributes to ESD
because it tackles the inherent complexity of
sustainability issues. It looks at conflicting interests
or possible synergies in a given space, opening the
way to the negotiation process. From there, to take
the idea of participation central to ESD seriously,
learners can reflect on what this could mean for
‘acting geographically’, even if the school setting
does not always inherently foster this action
competence. It is, however, possible to study and
reflect on possible alternative developments and
their implication on space and to identify strategies
to implement them. Some projects even allow
learners to ‘train in participation’ by implementing
a project within the school or the local community
but this can only be suggested in a textbook.
For textbook authors, this means adopting a
pedagogical approach that trains these ways of
‘thinking geographically’, creating tasks that ask
learners to analyze a sustainability issue under a
geographical perspective and work on ‘questions of
geography’ as shown in Figure 4. These questions,
echoing what was put forward in section 1.1, can be:
Where is something located and why? What patterns
and processes can be observed in space? How are
society and the natural environment interrelated?
What spatial actions have been taken by which
actors and with what representations? At what
spatial scales? (see sources at the bottom of Table
1). Making the link to participation implies working
with dilemma situations fostering a negotiation,
or situations in which learners have to decide
which spatial action to take while refl ecting on the
consequences of their choice and on strategies they
would implement for achieving their spatial action.
More examples are given in sections 2 and 3.
Building on people’s own experience
The third point mentioned in the paragraph from
the 2016 charter quoted above talks about how
school geography is linked to learner-centred
approaches – ‘building on people’s own experience’.
The idea is not to blur the limits between ‘objective’
knowledge and learners’ preconceptions, also called
social knowledge, which is a risk evoked by Firth
(2011). The idea is to help create a link between
individually lived geographies and consolidated
geographical knowledge, and between locally
‘lived’ issues and global phenomena (see subsection
1.2.3). This implies that we recognize the
need to include the learners’ own experiences and
geographies (Holloway and Valentine, 2000) and

geographical knowledge and being able to question
that knowledge that a balance advantageous to
ESD is to be found. This tension also leaves space for
integrating community knowledge in addition to the
more classical and critical knowledge (see Figure 4
(Gutstein, 2007) in the Maths chapter). This is a central
issue for ESD because it makes the link to local issues
and contributes to relevant knowledge of SD. It is
also central to geography education itself because
‘formal, academic geography that has become
institutionalized is not the only form of geographical
knowledge’ (Bonnet, 2008, in Morgan, 2013, p. 279).
1.2.4
Conclusion: the importance
of achieving the right blend
of content and pedagogy
in geographical education
for ESD
School geography has the potential to contribute
greatly to ESD through its content and pedagogical
approach. To maximize geography’s potential, it is
important to achieve the right blend of content and
pedagogy from the outset. Subject-centred and
learner-centred approaches must be considered
together, not as opposing poles. The examination
of the ecological-social relationship and its
dynamics within space can be enhanced
through a pedagogy that allows learners to
question, examine, discuss and have diff erent
opinions, even on geography itself. This enables
geographical education to contribute to greater
democracy at local and global levels and to work
to achieve ecological sustainability and peace.
Figure 5: Content and pedagogy are two intertwined
aspects of the same approach to geography
The rest of this chapter will use tools and examples to
provide a structured way to address the link between
geographical education and ESD.
1.2.3
Refl ecting on geographical
knowledge for ESD
A textbook author can also include a refl ection on
geographical knowledge itself and make learners
aware that it is ‘socially constructed’ (Morgan,
2013, p. 274): ‘Geographical knowledge does not
innocently refl ect the “real world” but instead refl ects
the subjective interests of geographers which are
infl uenced by values of given societies in given times’.
This challenges a prevailing idea that there is an
objective ‘real world’, which is studied by geographers
to produce ‘knowledge’ that is then transmitted to
students in schools (ibid. pp. 273–274). The debate
around the human origin of climate change clearly
shows how knowledge production can be at the heart
of societal discussion. In some cases, governments
can choose to focus on voices from scientifi c margins
to avoid questioning present economic practices,
thus infl uencing which knowledge should be
considered ‘true’. In the case of natural hazards, it
can be interesting to question why these hazards
are defi ned as ‘natural’. Perhaps it is easier to adopt
a fatalistic point of view that emphasizes natural
phenomena than to question economic and political
choices that may increase risk and/or vulnerability.
Therefore, making maps and ‘writing’ geography in
textbooks, in eff ect, plays a political role. This should
be dealt with consciously and looked at by the
textbook author on the one hand, and integrated in
such a way that the learners become aware of it on
the other. This is true as early as in primary school –
where pupils start working on their sense of place,
citizenship and social engagement – and remains
valid all through the school years as learners develop
their own images of the world and create their own
personal geographies. According to this perspective,
the idea of ‘critical school geography’
(Huckle, 1997), which promotes
critical thinking on geography itself
as a core target of geographical
education, is in line with the critical
thinking at the core of ESD.
However, questioning geographical
knowledge should not mean drifting
into relativism and ‘alternative facts’
while ignoring the importance
of existing knowledge built over
a long period by a community of
researchers and agreed upon by
major parts of society. This process
leads to a certain ‘objectivity’ of
knowledge (see Young, 2008; Young
and Muller, 2010; Firth, 2011; Morgan, 2013), giving it
the legitimacy of being what is studied at school and
having the power to go beyond personal experience.
It is only when you know a lot about natural hazards
that you can question whether they are ‘natural’.

Embedding ESD
in geography
textbooks is not only
a matter of working
with a certain type
of geographical
content, but also
a matter of using
pedagogical
approaches
consistent with ESD
Getting tangible: how to embed ESD
in geography textbooks
2.0
As stipulated in the Introductory chapter (see section 1.5.1), school systems and their textbooks vary worldwide.
For example, certain countries focus on factual knowledge while others concentrate on competencies. Related
learning objectives vary according to the context. To remain as inclusive as possible, while taking the idea of
blending content and pedagogy seriously, the development of textbooks is addressed in this section through
a double perspective. One approach considers ways of working with geographical content in coherence with
ESD, the other looks at ways of orientating geographical tasks along ESD pedagogical principles or guidelines.
To maximize the potential of geographical education for ESD, both approaches should be considered in an
interrelated way. This means that embedding ESD in geography textbooks is not only a matter of working with
a certain type of geographical content, but also a matter of using pedagogical approaches consistent with ESD.
This mingling of both approaches (content and pedagogy) helps to avoid the transmission of sterile information
and mechanical application of factual knowledge devoid of meaning and contextual relevance. It can contribute
to developing geographical competencies5 relevant to ESD, as shown in Figure 6. Having two possible ‘entries’
provides enough fl exibility to embed ESD coherently with contextualized learning objectives, which will have to
be defi ned by textbook authors according to local specifi cities.

Geographical tasks

Figure 6: Combining content and pedagogy to develop ESD-relevant competencies
To address these two possible ‘entries’, a tool
articulated in two parts has been elaborated (see
overview of the embedding tool). One part suggests
criteria for working on geographical content so that
it is relevant to ESD (see Spider-web 1), the other
part triggers a refl ection on geographical tasks
that foster ESD (see Spider-web 2). After a general
explanation relating to the spider-webs, an example
on the topic of water illustrates how it is possible to
use them. A third sub-section briefl y presents three
complementary tools of interest in ESD to show
possible articulation between existing tools and the
approach we present here.
How to use the spider-webs6
The aim of the two spider-webs is to provide an
orientation for authors wanting to embed ESD in
their geography textbook. They are a thinking tool
designed to take an ESD-relevant perspective while
developing the textbook, rather than a normative
imperative to which every part of the textbook has
to correspond rigidly. This fl exibility is needed for
several reasons:
● The diff erent branches of the spider-webs are
related to one another, which implies, in general,
5 See the defi nition given in the Introductory chapter.
6 Th e idea of using spider-webs in the fi eld of ESD was developed by a team of Swiss researchers wanting to embed ESD in teaching practices
(Kyburz-Graber, Nagel and Odermatt, 2010 and Kyburz-Graber, Nagel and Gingins, 2013). Th e team has developed a ‘content’ spider-web with
ESD-relevant ‘thematic areas’ such as ‘ethics and culture’ or ‘natural resources’ as well as a ‘pedagogical principles’ spider-web similar to the one
presented in this chapter. Th e tool was tested by around 130 teachers before being published. In this chapter, the ‘content’ spider-web has been
adapted so as to work on aspects of geographical content contributing to ESD, and the ‘pedagogical principles’ spider-web has been adapted to
match the competencies presented in the Introductory chapter.
116 | GEOGRAPHY
that more than one branch of the spider-web is
addressed at a time. For example, looking at the
‘human-environment interdependencies’ usually
implies looking at ‘actors’ and their spatial actions
(Spider-web 1). Or thinking of alternative options
for the future (‘facing the future with creativity’)
requires critical examination of the present
situation (‘critical thinking’) (Spider-web 2).
● Following the same logic, the content and tasks
of the textbook can be categorized in various
ways and thus address more than one branch
of the spider-web. For example, understanding
why volcanoes are concentrated along the limits
of tectonic plates can be categorized under
‘localization’ (where and why there?) as well as
under ‘patterns and processes’ (there is a system in
the fact that volcanoes concentrate along the limits
of tectonic plates). In the same way, population
settlements and dynamics can be looked at
under these both perspectives (‘localization’ and/
or ‘patterns and processes’). For tasks, a roleplay
taking into consideration diverse perspectives
can address the principle of ‘critical thinking’
and/or the principle of ‘dealing with values’. If the
aim of the roleplay is to fi nd a common solution,
the principles of ‘collaboration and communication’
and ‘facing the future with creativity’ are addressed.
● It is also possible that some elements of a chapter are
seen rather as a prerequisite for looking at an issue
under a geographical perspective and so do not
fi t systematically in the spider-webs. For example,
if working on climate change, understanding how
the greenhouse eff ect works and pointing out the
specifi cs of present climate changes compared
with previous natural variations could be seen as a
prerequisite for looking at climate change under a
geographical and therefore spatial perspective. Or,
if a link to spatial logics is integrated (for example,
climatic zones), this point could correspond to the
criteria ‘patterns and processes’.
What the spider-webs allow:
● They help authors keep an overview of the type of
geographical content and pedagogical approaches
used. It prevents, for example, a chapter omitting
to look at the underlying value of a given spatial
organization within a sustainability issue. They
provide a base that helps authors to take into
account complementary perspectives of a
geographical issue or a complementary set of tasks
to contribute to ESD as much as possible. This does
not mean that the aim is to tackle every aspect of
the spider-webs at all times, which is diffi cult at the
task level and could lead to superfi ciality. However,
looking at ‘patterns and processes’ taking into
account ‘human-environment interrelations’ and
the role of ‘actors’ in these patterns and processes
contributes more to ESD than looking at patterns
and processes alone because it leads to a deeper
understanding of a SD issue. See completed Spiderweb
1 for content and completed Spider-web 2 for
pedagogical principles.
● They help set a focus that could enhance the
contribution of a given chapter or task to ESD. For
the natural hazards topic in section 1.2.1, looking
in detail at the ‘human-environment interrelations’
as well as the underlying values (‘dealing with
values’) of given spatial actions can lead to a critical
refl ection (‘critical thinking’) of the human role in
natural hazards. This contributes more to ESD than
if the hazards are simply considered to be ‘natural’.
● They can be used to work at two levels: chapter
(the outline of the chapter) and task.
2.1
How to select geographical
content for ESD – content
criteria
Infl uential charters and declarations (Haubrich,
2007; IGU-CGE, 2016) state that it is unwise to seek
a consensus on a global geographical curriculum,
heterogeneity being too important. Of course, major
topics such as climate change, migration, natural
hazards, urbanization or water might appear in most
school curricula. However, the intention of having a
‘content’ selection tool is to allow the presentation
of any geographical topic relevant to the context in
which the textbook is written and to examine it from
a specifi c angle. The following criteria presented have
been derived from the contributions of geographies
to SD as discussed in the fi rst section of this chapter
and echoed in the ‘ways of thinking as a geographer’
already identifi ed in Table 1.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 117
Table 2: Characteristics of geographical education that can contribute to ESD
Geography textbooks develop ‘ways to think like a
geographer’ when they…
The contribution to SD and, therefore,
to ESD
Allow learners to understand why things are located
where they are: localization and why there?
Example: Most urban areas are located near a lake
or a river because they provide water and transport
possibilities. Most volcanoes are located along merging
or diverging tectonic plate limits where magma comes
up to the surface.
Every sustainability issue has a spatial localization.
Understanding the logic of this localization helps
anchor the issue in a local reality and its specifi cities.
Th is is to be taken into account when thinking of
alternatives for SD. Geography specifi cally addresses
such localization issues.
Illustrate the interrelation between humans and the
natural environment by looking at infl uences of and on
spaces: human-environment interrelation in space.
Example: Climate change aff ects human activities that,
in turn, aff ect the climate.
Th is human-nature interrelation is at the core of SD
and allows us to see things as a system where elements
are intertwined. Geography specifi cally illustrates these
interrelations in space.
Take into consideration the interrelation among
human societies/groups/individuals by pointing out
diff erent actors and the impact of their worldviews and
decisions on space. Th is implies that underlying values
and power relationships and their infl uence on spatial
actions have to be made explicit because not every
actor has the same values or the same decision power.
Learners can be considered one of these actors: actors.
Example: Houses of rich people take more space and
are situated on better locations that the huts of poorer
people, thus showing power relationships in space.
SD is about choices, values and participation so it is
essential to look at actors and governance issues in
order to understand their impact on space, the way
they are aff ected by space, and what their conceptions
concerning issues of sustainability are. Taking into
account diff erent perspectives, confl icting interests and
ways of solving them contributes to addressing issues
of peace and social justice. Geography specifi cally
makes the link between the choices of actors and their
impacts on space.
Refl ect issues at diff erent spatial scales, from the local
to the global and vice versa, and make interactions
between these scales clear: spatial scales.
Example: Biofuel might seem to be a good solution
for mitigating climate change when considered at the
scale of a western country, but is a problematic solution
when considered at a wider scale because it challenges
food production in most countries that produce it in
large quantities.
In a globalized world, a local action can have a global
impact and vice versa, which implies it is not enough
to address a topic at one scale. Moreover, SD as well
as global citizenship integrate the idea of solidarity at
a worldwide level, which can be taken into account
by linking diff erent scales and groups of people.
Geography specifi cally brings this ability to examine
topics at various spatial scales.
Look at spatial patterns and geographical processes
in a dynamic perspective. Th is includes patterns of
polarization and diff usion of phenomena but also the
evolution and organization of space over time: patterns
and processes.
Example: Economic activities of the tertiary sector
have been concentrated in city centres but are now
frequently located in the suburbs, implying other
mobility behaviour.
SD is also about linking local processes to broader
patterns leading to possible generalizations and the
identifi cation of unsustainable practices at a broad
level. Moreover, SD is not a static concept and is,
therefore, a process. Geography contributes to this
understanding by identifying patterns and evolving
spatial organization.
118 | GEOGRAPHY
Based on these criteria, the working tool presented
below has been developed to help select
geographical content for ESD. To give meaning to
the content and avoid a ‘pile up’ of knowledge that
might make little sense to students, it is important
to articulate content either around a contemporary
issue (is water a human right?) or a question to be
solved (how can we be fair in water management?).
This can also be articulated around a case study (is it
possible to resolve the tensions around the Mekong
river?). See Fabre (2014), Pache and Hertig (under
press) and the Science chapter of this guidebook for
further insight.
Spider-web 1:
A tool to help textbook
writers select geographical
content relevant to ESD
As an example of how the tool can be used, we will work out the topic of water showing a possible implementation
at the level of a chapter and at the level of a task. The contribution to ESD is made explicit.
2.1.1
Example of selecting content for the topic of water
– CHAPTER LEVEL
Question along which the chapter can be articulated: How can we manage water in a way that
benefi ts most people without depleting the resource?
Localization: Where and why there?
Explain where water is to be found and why it is found there at a global (water stock in the poles) and/
or a more local/regional level (shape of the water basin and types of rocks constituting it, rainfall and/or
presence of glaciers, lakes created by human intervention, such as dams or dykes, and so on).
Contribution to ESD: By refl ecting the localization of water availability and explaining the water cycle,
geography gives information on the repartition and renewal capacity of a resource. By appreciating the
subtlety of those mechanisms and the limits of the system, value can be given to water. A good understanding
of water availability locally and worldwide is of crucial importance when identifying (un)sustainable
practices or thinking of possible future scenarios and related alternative solutions (for example, what if all
glaciers disappeared as a result of climate change? Would human intervention, such as a dam, solve the
problem in place X?).
Which human-environment interrelations?
Show the link between the presence of water and human activities illustrated in space (for example,
urbanization, fi shing settlements, industrial activities and energy production, transport infrastructure
and so on, but also water-related risks and related management measures) and the impact of human
activities on water (for example, control of riverbeds through the building of dykes and dams that

aff ect local ecosystems, pollution and its impacts on aquatic ecosystems and surrounding inhabitants,
over-consumption of the resource because of demographic pressure, ineffi cient irrigation habits or
water-demanding activities, such as golf courses in dry countries). Give examples of unsustainable and
sustainable interrelations.
Contribution to ESD: By understanding water as a system of which our societies are a part, and seeing
diff erent uses of water, learners become aware that water availability is not only a matter of the quantity of
water present but of how it is used. Th ey also understand that they, as consumers, are part of the system and
that all society is dependent on the resource. Looking at the human-environment interrelation contributes
to a holistic understanding of the issue, pointing out the consequences of certain actions on the environment
but also on societies in turn.
Which human-human interrelations, which actors?
Make clear that there are numerous actors, with diff erent perspectives and values, who need and/or
deal with water, who have diff erent degrees of power to interfere with the access and management
of the resource. Pointing out diff erent perspectives, power relationships and how these are visible in
space is a crucial element when talking about water-management confl icts and refl ecting alternative
solutions. A multinational company exploiting a spring, for example, has diff erent intentions to a local
community exploiting the same spring for its own needs. Th e company may have more power than the
local community, depending on the position of the government and existing regulations. Th e impact on
space could be that the local community might have to move and that a water-treatment plant would be
built near the spring. Another example can be given of how such confl icting interests have been solved
in a peaceful way within the frame of sustainability, showing what impact this has on space.
Contribution to ESD: Th is raises awareness that water-related infrastructures refl ect values and power
relations contribute to seeing the world as a system that is infl uenced by the merging or confl icting
interests of individual and collective actors within a given space. It helps to address problems at the core
of sustainability issues and to identify the actors at the root of spatial action that can support or hinder
change. It also helps to refl ect solutions, taking into account issues of peace and social justice while looking
at water distribution.
At what spatial scales?
Point out that water management can be examined at diff erent spatial scales and may make diff erent impacts
at these scales. For example, the impact of constructing a dam might be considered positive at a regional
or national level because it could provide electricity or water to a surrounding area and thus enhance the
quality of life for part of the population without emitting CO2. However, it might make a negative impact
on existing ecosystems and local human communities as a result of fl ooding. At an international level, the
dam might prevent enough water reaching areas in need in a neighbouring country.
Contribution to ESD: Being aware that the construction of a dam has diverse impacts at various scales helps
to tackle water management as a complex and systemic issue. Considering the environmental and social
impacts at various scales diminishes the risk of taking decisions valid only at one scale – and which might be
unsustainable. It helps learners to think about compensatory measures that take into account biodiversity
and social justice if the dam is built.
What dynamic (patterns and processes)?
Show that the presence of water attracts human activities but that too great a concentration of these
activities leads systematically to the depletion of the resource in areas where it is not abundant enough.
As a consequence, confl icts between various water users can arise. Make visible the fact that spatial
issues and infrastructures related to water have changed over time and that the development of various
economic sectors, such as tourism, has increased pressure on water in many countries. For example,
Brazil’s position as an emerging market has increased its construction of hydro-dams. Complete with
examples of positive evolution towards greater sustainability.
Contribution to ESD: Working with patterns aff ords a ‘big picture’ vantage point and highlights recurrent
logic related to water availability, distribution and use. Th e process-oriented nature of geography helps us
to take into account the possible evolution of these patterns. Both elements are of great use when identifying
unsustainable patterns of water consumption and when thinking or planning future developments in
sustainable water management.

2.1.2
Example of selecting content for the topic of water
– TASK LEVEL
● Situation (as text): Th e factories on the river X use water for processing their goods, which
are successfully sold for export, providing a strong fi nancial income for the local communities.
However, these factories are polluting the river to such a degree that its natural systems are
breaking down, adversely aff ecting the health of all living things that depend on the river –
humans included. A decision has to be taken on what to do: the situation cannot continue.
Th e local governance system allows participation of civil society to a certain extent.
● Actors’ perspective (in illustration and text): Pictures of several actors are inserted in the
textbook with related texts expressing their perspectives, their relationships with the river and
their decision-making power. Th e factories are represented by economic actors, whose aim is
to make money but whose businesses depend on the right to use the river, granted by the local
government. Th ey have a lot of power because they fostered the area’s economic development.
Th e local government representatives depend on the industrial activity because it brings in tax
money. Th ey also have to ensure the health of their community and ecosystems, be it only to
secure their re-election. Th ey have the power to intervene through legal means by not renewing
the right to use the river. Th e members of the local community are aff ected by pollution and
fear for their health. But quite a signifi cant amount of people are employed by the factories
and some wealthy community members can aff ord and appreciate the produced goods. Th e
community is weak in terms of its power but can wield infl uence if its members gather together
to exert pressure at a political level or if factory workers decide to strike.
● Impact on space (as a map): A schematic map of the area showing geophysical aspects,
existing industrial infrastructures around the river and localization of the communities.
Th e spider-web corresponding to this example would look as follows and is to be articulated with the

spider-web have been addressed. Th e choice of
the content tackled within each ‘branch’ will be
infl uenced by the expected learning outcomes, the
chosen general question to be answered and the
pedagogical principles addressed. If future thinking
is to be worked on, the chapter should include more
examples of sustainable ways of addressing water
management. Having set the general framework
for the content of a whole chapter, the same logic
would apply for refl ecting on the content of specifi c
tasks, as shown in the next section.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 121
As already explained in ‘How to use the spiderwebs’
at the beginning of section 2.0, more than
one criterion is generally fulfi lled, even at the
level of a task, but not all criteria are considered
because it is diffi cult to take into account all
aspects at the task level. Ideally, the aim would be
to have tackled all elements in an articulated way
while completing all tasks within the chapter.
Th e ‘content’ spider-web can also be used to
analyze the content of an existing textbook to
identify how it is ESD-compatible, for example,
when considering a new adapted edition.
Figure 7 shows an illustration from an
Figure 7:
Geographical content

Social Geography of Rajasthan, Sunny (

existing textbook, Sprout: A Social Geography
of Rajasthan. The example focuses on actors
and their perspectives in relation to the
construction of a dam. However, it also reflects
the situation at different scales and looks at the
human-environment interrelation by showing
environmental impacts. Starting from such
geographical content, it is easy to embed ESD
by imagining tasks inspired by the pedagogical
principles described in the next section. See
also the example showing how, based on
existing content in a textbook, a set of tasks can
be added so as to enhance the embedding of
ESD (see sixth example in section 3.0).
122 | GEOGRAPHY
2.2
How to create tasks in
geography that embed
ESD – pedagogical
principles
The previous section has shown how the choice of
geographical content integrated in the textbook can
contribute to ESD. This can be tackled in parallel with
pedagogical approaches favourable to ESD. Section
2.2 shows how to mobilize geographical tasks and
specifi c features of geographical education, such as
investigation and fi eldwork, mapping or working
on ‘ways of thinking as a geographer’ (see Table 1),
to make them relevant to ESD. A fi rst sub-section
looks at some general pedagogical principles or
guidelines that are not specifi c to but are necessary
for ESD. The second sub-section addresses more ESDrelated
pedagogical principles or guidelines. These
echo the competencies presented in the Introductory
chapter.
2.2.1
General pedagogical principles
Taking the following general principles into account
sets a pedagogical base favourable to ESD:
● The textbook is learner-centred, which means that:
– The textbook supports teachers in taking
into account learners’ preconceptions and
worldviews. This is important in geography
because a sense of place is a very individual
matter. As mentioned in section 1.2.3, being
learner-centred should not be set in opposition
to being knowledge-centred – the textbook
supports ways of making links between
learners’ personal geographies and stabilized
geographical knowledge. An example of this is
to be found in section 3.2.
– A link between the learner’s language and
scientifi c language is made. One possible way is
to include some texts written by young people
acquainted with the topic.
– Abstract knowledge is made comprehensible
and meaningful through contextualization
(working on local case studies, for example) and
facilitating pedagogical approaches.
● The textbook helps enhance the student’s ability
to become an independent learner (see also
the principle of acquiring knowledge in Table
3) and so adopts an approach tending towards
constructivism. This implies that the textbook
encourages learners to gather some information
themselves (such as through fi eldwork or
conducting internet research) and either presents
some blank space for learners to write down their
result or suggests they do it on a separate sheet.
In both cases, the teacher is the one validating the
information gathered. It might be helpful to have
some supporting comments in the teacher’s guide,
if applicable.
● Geography is about reading and writing the
world, so it is essential that the textbook transmits
diff erentiated worldviews that challenge
stereotypical visions and negative categorizations.
This implies that:
– The wording present in the textbook is chosen
carefully to avoid reinforcing stereotypes (see
the Languages chapter) and marginalized voices
are represented. The word ‘underdeveloped’
could be replaced by ‘less developed from a
capitalist perspective’ because communities
less integrated in the present economic
globalization process might have a relation to
nature and resource consumption that is much
more relevant to sustainability issues than most
‘developed’ communities. When talking about
such communities, it can be interesting to
include some texts produced by their members,
showing their perspective on mainstream
understandings of development.
– The images chosen for the textbook complement
the text and challenge stereotypical visions of
the world at the level of gender, religion, wealth,
development and so on. Maps, in particular,
have to be chosen very carefully because they
are a powerful means with which to ‘write’ the
world. For example, maps that ignore minorities
and so foster the worldview of those in power or
reinforce mainstream perceptions (for example,
the north-south dichotomy or the importance of
GDP as the only measurement of ‘development’)
should be balanced with maps questioning
these issues (for example, a map illustrating the
Gross National Happiness Index).
– Generalizations should not show only one
perspective on an issue, as has been done in this
extract:
The underdeveloped and poor countries are
located in Africa and Asia. They are distressed
by wars and have no natural resources and
no ways of exploiting them. Several of these
countries are governed by dictators, who keep
the riches for themselves while a large part
of their population lives in extremely poor
conditions, with no food, no schools …

While part of what is written above corresponds
to a certain reality, it would off er a more
diff erentiated perspective if it included positive
examples of countries in Africa and Asia, where

functioning governance systems have reduced
poverty and where some parts of the population
exemplify civil courage and initiatives that
everyone could learn from.
● As already mentioned, geography deals with
systems by acting as a bridge between the natural
and social sciences while focusing on the spatial
dimension. It is possible to reinforce this systemic
approach by making links to related disciplines (for
example, physics when looking at climate change,
or history when focusing on processes). Within
this guidebook, the exercise on the trajectory of
a typhoon in the Maths chapter or the example
focusing on bees in the Science chapter would
be possible ways of looking at an issue in an
interdisciplinary perspective.
In addition to these general principles, the ones
that follow relate more directly to ESD and so are
particularly relevant when embedding ESD in
geography textbooks.
2.2.2
ESD-related pedagogical
principles
These ESD pedagogical principles or guidelines
are related to competencies presented in the
Introductory chapter, with the following variations
aimed at reducing the list:
● Solving issues/problems/confl icts is addressed
here in the principle of collaboration and
communication as well as the one of participation.
● Changing perspectives is included in refl ecting on
values and critical thinking.
● Thinking and acting inclusively is part of showing
solidarity and responsibility. We have named this
principle ‘bonding and stewardship’ because a
sense of ownership underlies the idea of solidarity
and responsibility.
● The idea of creativity, not present in the original
list, has been integrated in facing the future
because ‘thinking outside the box’ is central to
fi nding solutions and considering alternative ways
to develop societies.
The articulation of these principles can be seen here
in Figure 8.

Acquiring knowledge
Figure 8: ESD-related pedagogical principles or guidelines
The pedagogical principles presented in Figure 8
are overlapping because they can be combined
and nourish one another. For example, having a
deep understanding of a system helps a student to
look critically at an issue, which might help them
to imagine creative alternatives for the future.
Eventually, all these principles should contribute to
participation because committed action towards SD
is central to ESD. The idea of acquiring knowledge
underlies all other principles because being able to
gather SD-relevant knowledge autonomously is a
core issue (Audigier 2011, Pellaud 2011) and relates
to all other principles. This transversal principle
complements the one about the learner’s autonomy
mentioned under the general principles. It is not only
about learning ‘how to solve a task in the textbook
autonomously’ but about being an independent
citizen in a fast-evolving world, where facts that are
valid today – as well as current ways of thinking and
doing – might soon be outdated.
The following section shows how geographical tasks,
based on the pedagogy of geographical education
seen in section 1.2.2, can be orientated along these
principles to contribute to ESD. This should be
done in interaction with the elements relating to
geographical content, tackled earlier (see Spider-web
1). Spider-web 2, which addresses the pedagogical
principles to be considered, has been developed
using the same logic that was applied to the content
criteria. As already explained (see ‘How to use the
spider-webs’):
124 | GEOGRAPHY
● Most aspects of geographical education can
contribute to more than one of the abovementioned
principles because they are interrelated,
Fieldwork, for example, can create a link to a local
community and thus foster the idea of bonding
and stewardship but can also contribute to dealing
with systems and acquiring knowledge.
● The spider-web can be used for an overview of the
pedagogical approaches within a whole chapter or
it can help to create individual tasks. In this case,
not all principles can be addressed at the same
time but can lead to a complementary set of tasks
within the chapter.
Here, again, the aim of this section is to suggest
pathways that textbook authors could follow in their
process of embedding.

the following ESD-related
pedagogical principles
Examples of what it implies for geography textbook authors when

Bonding and
stewardship
Connect students to a community
and/or the environment, allowing
a sense of wonder and empathy
as well as physical and emotional
belonging so as to enhance their
stewardship and their sense of
responsibility and willingness to act.
Work with the ‘sense of wonder’ geography education can generate. Use the opportunity
that investigation and fi eldwork off er to create a link to local surroundings and capitalize of
the fact that diverse cultures are studied to give people a sense of global citizenship.
For example:
• Give instructions and methods for making surveys, drawing landscapes and/or maps
in the fi eld.
• Suggest ways of experiencing local geographies (land art, participation in community
projects, etc.)
• Integrate narratives that enhance the magic of the human-nature relationship or work
on evoking empathy for people in other parts of the world.
• Pay attention to the aesthetic of textbooks and integrate visuals that can touch the
emotional world of learners.

Refl ecting values
Make underlying values explicit
to foster understanding of other
people’s perspectives but also
awareness of possible synergies or
confl icting interests. Compare
them with the idea of basic needs,
intra- and intergenerational equity
and a framework of values related
to SD, peace and social justice to
avoid relativism.
See the remarks immediately after
this table.
Make underlying values of spatial actions and mapping visible, link them to the vision of SD
and discuss the meaning people give to places. For example:
• Ask learners to take a position on a certain spatial issue and leave blank spaces so they
can record an argument, making the underlying value of their choice explicit. Then
have them refl ect their choice on the basis of extracts from the Earth Charter.
• Foster roleplay aimed at solving a given space-planning issue. Give the diff erent actors
diverse values.
• Make learners plan a new district or a new region according to their values or to given
values (for example, social inclusion versus segregation, or beauty versus economic
growth). Compare the results and discuss the values that emerged. Identify which
scenario best tends towards SD.
• Identify mental models at the root of a spatial situation considered to be unsustainable
(see Figure 10: the Iceberg Model).
Critical thinking
Provide learners with tools helping
to identify, understand and question
the central and sometimes hidden
issues (such as power relationships)
of existing situations and ways of
life, as well as mechanisms that lead
to the successful implementation
of sustainable practices (question
the status quo and ‘look behind the
curtain’). Encourage learners to look
at diff erent perspectives, including
confl icting ones, and build a
personal opinion.
Identify patterns and processes, look at diff erent perspectives on spatial issues at various
scales and use investigation methods to access diff erent kinds of geographical information.
For example:
• Ask learners to identify a central geographical issue related to SD within a given text or
analyze a given map.
• Integrate classical ‘scientifi c’ knowledge, critical knowledge and informal community
knowledge (see section 1.2.3), suggesting ways of articulating them.
• Insert information in the textbook that fosters the understanding of underlying
mechanisms. For example, in the case of humanitarian aid, show how competition
between NGOs slows the aid process or how countries show their power by promising
large amounts of money for aid, promises that are not always kept.
• Ask learners to consider provocative questions such as ‘Why is climate change a
problem when climate has always changed?’ to point out the specifi cs of the ongoing
change related to human activity (see Figure 10: the Iceberg Model).
Give instructions so that learners search the internet for information that is diffi cult to fi nd,
such as the costs of the last football World Cup, make them cross-reference diverse sources
and discuss why such information is diffi cult to fi nd.
Dealing with systems
Present situations and issues as
a system in which nature and
societies are intertwined and look
at the dynamics of this system
while including diverse linear and
non-linear interactions. Highlight
how societies rely on nature and
how nature and societies aff ect
each other.
Use the focus on the human-environment interrelations at diff erent scales to look at the
world as a system. For example:
• Integrate tools to help learners explore a local and familiar subject, taking into account
diff erent aspects and perspectives and showing how they are linked (see Figure 9: the
Sustainability Compass).
• Show ways in which natural systems are sustainable and make learners refl ect on what
human societies could learn from them.
• Present an unfi nished mindmap with the words ‘water’, ‘salad’ and ‘petrol’ and ask
learners to link these elements and explain their relationships. Then ask students to
refl ect on what would happen if the word ‘petrol’ were taken away.
• Ask learners to invent an alternative ending for a situation/story presented in the
textbook after having changed an element of the situation (see also facing the future
with creativity).
126 | GEOGRAPHY
Facing the future
with creativity
Give room to imagination, divergent
ideas and inventions to be explored
so that alternative visions of existing
situations and ways of doing can be
developed. Encourage learners’ visions
of possible futures and confront them
with reality. Train them to anticipate
the impacts of present actions on
future generations. Teach learners to
take advantage of change.
Use the dynamic nature of geography to look at processes and imagine future evolutions.
For example:
• Ask learners to draw their vision of how cities will be in 100 years’ time, then how
they would like them to be. Compare both drawings with the vision of sustainable
cities and identify which depiction is nearer to a sustainable city. Identify two
measures that could be taken to move towards such a city (link to participation).
• Let learners explore and choose from future scenarios and/or alternatives on given
geographical subjects and ask them to mobilize their acquired knowledge to justify
their choices.
• Based on factual knowledge presented in the textbook, ask learners to write an
article about a specifi c geographical issue (for example, risk management given a
rise in global temperature of 2°C or more; their own life as grandparents observing
the changes that have happened in the environment, city, transport, interaction
between people, and so on) as if they were journalists in 2100.
• Work with ‘what if?’ stories, such as ‘what if petrol were free/unavailable’ or for smaller
children ‘what if chocolate were free?’ Older learners could be asked to draw a
diagram showing diff erent levels of consequences and how some of them might be
connected (see also dealing with systems).
• Provide half a story illustrating the evolution of a geographical issue up to the
present day and let them write the end (once freely, then asking them to take into
consideration principles of SD). Compare with existing scientifi cally based scenarios.
Collaboration and
communication
Help learners to know themselves
(for example, their values and
goals) and recognize others’ values
and goals so as to acknowledge
diversity. Encourage them to work
together towards a common aim,
acknowledging the benefi ts of
working together but also the
diffi culties that can be addressed
constructively. Make it possible for
learners to elaborate opinions and
choices. Train them to communicate
clearly about collective analyses
and visions or about personal choices
and opinions.
Work with the fact that space is shared by several actors and so requires collaboration and
communication when being planned and used. Use the power of maps and other graphics
for synthesizing and communicating complex information. For example:
• Structure content so as to allow students to work on it in diff erent groups: each
group brings part of a ‘puzzle’ around a common question. With this example,
students can work in expert groups (three students work on the environmental
importance of water, three on the economic one, three others on related
social issues, then the groups are mixed to solve a given problem with their
complementary expertise).
• Create an exercise in which learners are asked to refl ect on the best ways to achieve
diff erent societal aims by choosing between ‘collective’ or ‘individual’ measures or
both to show the importance of collective solutions.
• Have learners investigate an SD issue and communicate the results as a graphic or a
map based on statistics so as to learn visual communication.
• Integrate a geographical situation in which diff erent actors use diverse types of
speech (for instance, comic-type illustrations) and ask learners to link the speech to a
given context (more or less formal).
Participation
Let learners take a stand, identify
possible opportunities to act and
develop implementation strategies: Is
there a possibility to act? How would
it work individually or collectively?
Who can help me? Who do I have
to consult? Where can I fi nd help to
support my project?
Remark: although experiencing action
can only be suggested by a textbook
and has to be realized ‘live’, identifying
strategies and planning a project can be
worked on in the textbook.
Use learner-centred pedagogies found in geography to get learners active, and work on
the role of actors in shaping space.
• Elaborate on a situation in which learners are asked to make a collective decision (for
example, to have a school garden) after having researched the subject (individual,
collective, legal, environmental and economic implications) and considered diff erent
perspectives presented in the textbook. Then ask learners to map their project and
defi ne steps to implement it (and, if possible, make it happen).
• Ask learners to choose between three action-scenarios facing an environmental issue
and identify one measure that would help in making the chosen scenario true.
• Have learners follow the diff erent steps to be taken to implement a project. The
textbook would indicate these steps and leave a blank space in which learners can
inscribe what that means for their project. The Pyramid Model in Figure 11 can
support this process.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 127
Two remarks are to be made concerning this table.
1. When working on the principle refl ecting values,
the aim is to make implicit values explicit, link them
to one another and to a common reference related
to SD (for example, the common guidelines of
the Earth Charter). In the process, it is essential to
distinguish diff erent scales (looking at underlying
economic logics explaining the way transport of
goods is organized or looking at my individual
transport choices) and diff erent steps. When working
at an individual level, personal values and their
translation in space can diff er greatly and should be
acknowledged and given room as they are, without
being judged. That means that if someone prefers
living in an individual house in the countryside and
someone else in an apartment in the city, the fi rst
step would be to make underlying values and needs
explicit (‘I like calm and the possibility to play in the
fi elds’ in the fi rst case; ‘I like meeting other people and
being near to urban activities’ in the other) without
commenting on them.
A second step can put the formulated values into
perspective, looking at the values of others and at
pros and cons of each way of living at individual and
collective level, as well as for the natural environment
(what would it mean for me, for others and for the
environment if everyone had a detached house/
everyone lived in apartment buildings?). A third or
alternative step could be to take a further perspective
and make an explicit link to the normative aspect of
SD in comparing each way of living with globally
accepted documents, such as the Earth Charter. Or
to devise an exercise based on the availability of a
resource: you have X square metres to lodge X people,
what kind of lodging will you have to plan? (see
comment on the second ESD-compatible existing
example in section 3.2). On this basis, it would be
possible in a fourth step to discuss alternative ways of
living and organizing space, taking into consideration
the elements tackled. If working directly with
learners’ perspectives could be stigmatizing or not
relevant, alternatives are to use ‘external’ pre-existing
examples or to work at another scale.
In brief, working with the values underlying spatial
organization is about working on these steps and
not just about telling learners what is right or wrong.
Vare and Scott (2007, pp. 193–194) acknowledge
that prescriptive measures promoting ‘behaviours
and ways of thinking, where the need for this is
clearly identifi ed and agreed’ (for example, recycling)
might make sense on the short term. However,
they add that the capacity to think critically on
these same prescriptions and to ‘test SD’ ideas is
essential in the longer term (for example, maybe it
is more appropriate to produce less waste than to
recycle, or recycling infrastructures might take away
employment from poorer people who earn a living
from recycling). In other words, although they see
both approaches – the prescriptive and the refl exive
– as complementary, they write that the ‘future will
depend less on our compliance in being trained to do
the “right” thing now, and more on our capability to
analyze, to question alternatives and negotiate our
decisions’ (p. 194).
2. Some suggestions present in the table lead to selfexploration
by the learner, fi eldwork and interaction
with non-educational actors. Whereas these activities
cannot be realized only by working with the
textbook, the last is a central learning tool to facilitate
instructions, work on methods and allow meaningful
ways of institutionalizing the acquired knowledge,
as suggested under acquiring knowledge. This,
however, implies that the textbook cannot be used
as a ‘ready-made recipe’ but requires the active role
of the teacher, who is seen more as a learning coach
than a knowledge transmitter.
Acquiring knowledge
Help learners to gain SD-relevant
knowledge by themselves
(individually and in networks),
look at it critically and compare it
with existing knowledge. Provide
methodologies for acquiring
knowledge or require learners to
generate methodologies.
The central role of investigation in geographical education brings an important added
value to working on this principle. Present methods and critical points to be considered for
gathering geographical information. It is also possible to include spaces in the textbook to
take note of gathered information in a structured way. Possible processes worth explaining
could be:
• How do I read and interpret a map/image/cartoon?
• How do I lead an inquiry from the perspective of SD? (See Figure 3.)
• How can I work out questions for an interview and how can I identify relevant
people to interview?
• How does the information I gathered relate to existing knowledge present in the
textbook and how does it relate to SD?
• How do I identify SD -relevant information and how do I synthesize information? (For
example, working with keywords or mind maps.)
• How do I represent information? (For example, the process for elaborating a map, a
mind map, a poster, or a PowerPoint presentation.)

2.2.3
Example of creating geographical tasks along ESD
principles for the topic of water
To illustrate how these pedagogical principles can be implemented within a geography textbook, an
example based on the content developed previously for the topic of water will show how geographical
tasks can be elaborated to contribute to ESD. Th e activity presented here requires that at least three
examples of possible ways to shape the human-nature and human-human interrelation in a sustainable
way have been worked on in the textbook previously. Th is will enable the learners to build on what they
have done already. Possible learning outcomes are that the learners will be able to:
● GIVE one reason explaining why the initial situation can be considered unsustainable and why a
change has to be undertaken.
● EXPLAIN the perspective of each implicated actor regarding change and identify one confl ict of
interest.
● PRESENT a possible alternative development and give two arguments explaining how it solves the
problematic situation in the best possible way.
● EXPLAIN one impact this alternative has on
– Th e river (an increase or decrease in pollution).
– Two implicated actors.
– Th e local spatial organization.
● COMPARE two possible alternative developments and evaluate which is more in coherence with the
principles of SD, giving two related arguments.
● DRAW the spatial impact of the most sustainable solution.
As a reminder, tasks in this example are based on the content of the previous ‘polluted river’ scenario as
set out in section 2.1.2. on p. 120.
• Situation (as text): The factories on the river X use water for processing their goods,
which are successfully sold for export, providing a strong financial income for the local
communities. However, these factories are polluting the river to such a degree that its
natural systems are breaking down, adversely affecting the health of all living things
that depend on the river – humans included. A decision has to be taken on what to do:
the situation cannot continue. The local governance system allows participation of civil
society to a certain extent.
• Actors’ perspective (in illustration and text): Pictures of several actors are inserted in
the textbook with related texts expressing their perspectives, their relationships with the
river and their decision-making power. The factories are represented by economic actors,
whose aim is to make money but whose businesses depend on the right to use the river,
granted by the local government. They have a lot of power because they fostered the area’s
economic development. The local government representatives depend on the industrial
activity because it brings in tax money. They also have to ensure the health of their
community and ecosystems, be it only to secure their re-election. They have the power to
intervene through legal means by not renewing the right to use the river. The members
of the local community are affected by pollution and fear for their health. But quite a
significant amount of people are employed by the factories and some wealthy community
members can afford and appreciate the products. The community is weak in terms of its
power but can wield influence if its members gather together to exert pressure at a political
level or if factory workers decide to strike.
• Impact on space (as a map): A schematic map of the area showing geophysical aspects,
existing industrial infrastructures around the river and localization of the communities.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 129
Tasks
• Learners are asked to identify one argument for the status quo and one for a change per actor. In the textbook, a
table with one line for each actor and two columns (pro and con arguments regarding change) helps to organize the
information.
• In groups of two or four, the students are required to develop one idea for a possible alternative, taking into account
the fact that the regeneration capacity of the river is overcome and there is a risk that further collapse of the ecosystem
would be irreversible. Th ey can refer to the previously seen example to elaborate the alternative, which they have
to justify. In the textbook, a space is provided in which the learner can write down the imagined alternative and its
justifi cation.
• Th e elaborated alternatives and their justifi cations are presented to the class, the aim is to be as convincing as
possible. Th e class votes on the suggestion they fi nd most adequate and convincing. Underlying values aff ecting the
vote are discussed.
– A blank space is provided in the textbook in which to write down the result of the vote and the main related
arguments.
– In a list of possible underlying values present in the textbook, learners underline those relevant to their
situation. Th is list has to prompt refl ection of ecological sustainability and social justice but also contains
unrelated values, such as the profi t motive.
– Using a coloured pen, learners mark whether the decision will make a positive (☺) or negative (☻) impact – or
both – on each actor in the table they had previously fi lled.
– On the map, they draw the implications of their decision on the way space is organized.
• Learners use the given documents to determine which actors have most power in decision-making and underline
them in the table to answer the question: ‘Would the decision within the community have been the same as yours if
you had taken existing power relationships into account?’ According to the answer, another colour can be used to
see who is aff ected positively or negatively by the decision that has been taken (it is supposed that those in power
will be aff ected positively), and what impact this would have on space.
• As a last step, the textbook provides a text presenting the alternative the community has found ‘in reality’ for the
studied case and a related map showing the impact of the decision on space. Learners compare the solution they
have imagined with the real one and are asked to evaluate which best respects ecological sustainability and social
justice and why. Th e textbook leaves a blank space for learners to write down the answer and its justifi cation. If the
imagined situation is close to the real one, learners can simply explain in what ways it is sustainable.
• Space is left for a general concluding comment, such as: ‘To take into account the long-term sustainability of the
aff ected communities, the preservation of the river and the health of the communities had to be set as a priority.
Industrial activity was reduced so it was no longer aff ecting the ecosystem, while still generating some income. An
alternative activity, not reliant on the river, had to be found for the people no longer employed by the factories.’
A spider-web corresponding to this example is as follows.

Completed Spider-web 2 shows how the following ESD principles are addressed
in this exercise
● Dealing with systems has been tackled in the described situation itself (echoing the humanenvironment
interrelations and the actor content criteria) and through the work around implicated
actors and their power relationships. Th e dynamics of the system are illustrated when learners refl ect
on the implications of a change on parts of the system (positive/negative impact for each actor and on
the river) and on the system as a whole (map of the alternative development).
● Critical thinking has been worked on by setting out the pros and cons of change and making visible
the partly confl icting interests and power issues of diff erent actors.
● A refl ection around values is addressed by the fact that the underlying values of each actor and of the
common vote are made explicit. Th e action of drawing a map shows the implication of a given choice
and its underlying values on space.
● Room is left for facing the future with creativity because learners need to imagine alternative
development possibilities, based on the information given in previous examples and for each actor.
Th ey then can link their deductions to the real situation.
● Participation is fostered through the need to fi nd a common solution, the voting process and the
examination of the consequence of a choice on space.
● Collaboration and communication are also addressed when the alternative solutions are discussed in
groups. Communicating these solutions in a convincing way is part of the task.
Ways to make interdisciplinary connections
● Possible link to natural sciences – chemical pollution of water, river ecosystems.
● Possible link to language – type of speech according to status in society, use of language for advocacy
while presenting the imagined alternative solution (see Language chapter,), constructive negotiation.
● Possible link to mathematics – calculate coordinates for locating the industrial area, calculate the
diff usion of pollution according to the water fl ow, determine statistics related to health issues.
2.2.4
Examples of tools that work along ESD principles
within geographical education
Th ere are many useful tools and methodologies to help integrate sustainability issues into geography
textbooks. We present a very short selection of three to show how existing cross-curricular tools can
be used within an embedding process in geography and how they can be articulated with the ESD
pedagogical principles presented above. Some tools are optimal for working more specifi cally on one of
the ESD pedagogical principles but oft en they can help foster several of them, depending upon how (in
which ‘pedagogical scenario’) they are implemented. Th e origins of the presented tools are as following:
● Th e Sustainability Compass and the Pyramid Model of learning and planning for sustainable
development were developed by the AtKisson Group and have been widely adopted in educational
circles through the NGO Compass Education (http://www.compasseducation.org). Th ey are available
for free at http://atkisson.com/acceleratorlite.
● Th e Iceberg Model is a widespread system-thinking tool presented by Goodman (1997) and adapted
for use in various fi elds since then: http://www.appliedsystemsthinking.com/supporting_documents/
Intro4WsandHow.pdf
SUSTAINABILITY COMPASS for exploring sustainability issues
Th e example used for water is shown here again to illustrate a way of using the Sustainability Compass.
Th e tool takes the familiar direction points of North, East, South and West and gives them the labels
Nature, Economy, Society and (personal) Well-Being. Th is helps to integrate the diff ering aspects of
sustainability so the user can have a much more complete vision of the sustainability issues surrounding a
particular topic. It works well for geography topics, bringing in a spatial dimension. Th e idea is that when
educators and learners become better systems thinkers and better understand the interconnectedness
of the human and natural systems all around them, their capacity to see areas where change can help to
steer these systems toward sustainability increases.

Considering the previous
water example, the Compass
shows that, on one hand, the
economies around the river are
particularly successful, providing
a strong fi nancial income for the
surrounding communities. On
the other hand, these industries
may be polluting the river to such
a degree that its natural systems
are breaking down, which can
adversely aff ect the health of
all living things that depend on
the river. In this example, the
economic and partly societal
aspects may score well around the
river, but the natural and personal
well-being aspects may be poor
enough to highlight that current
practices are unsustainable in
the bigger picture.
Figure 9: Sustainability Compass used for the topic of water with a focus on rivers
Textbook writers can use the Compass in three possible ways:
● As a tool for themselves. By placing a topic or issue in the middle of the Compass, textbook writers
can look at ways to take each compass point into account. Th is can help for a detailed implementation
of parts of the spider-webs (for example, human-environment interrelations for content and critical
thinking or dealing with systems for principles). For example, when writing a unit about rivers, a
writer can use the Compass to be sure he/she has provided
the necessary information needed for seeing the big picture
of how our human systems depend upon and aff ect rivers.
● As a tool provided to educators in the teachers’ guide, if
any. Teachers can use the Compass in their teaching in
complementary ways to the textbook. Th ey can use it for
brainstorming with the class on an issue or to help planning
their teaching unit.
● As a tool provided to learners.Th ey can examine a topic or
issue in much the same manner, or assess the sustainability of
an issue. Putting the issue in the middle of the Compass allows
learners to look for positive and negative ways in which the
issue aff ects the sustainability of each compass point. Th ey
thus can then get an overall picture of the sustainability of
the issue as a whole.
Link to the ESD pedagogical principles
Th is tool is ideal for dealing with systems and is one way of addressing the core geographical
concept of human-environment interrelations, making the link between the individual
and a broader context looked at from three perspectives. In doing so, it also fosters critical
thinking as confl icting interests might emerge. If an exercise is added whereby learners need
to think of possible scenarios if a component of the system changes, the idea of facing the
future with creativity is also worked on. Eventually, the compass can also be considered as a
method learners can integrate for the principle of acquiring knowledge.

ICEBERG MODEL for exploring underlying causes
Th e Iceberg Model is a way of exploring the underlying causes
of an event and corresponding driving values. By placing an
event at the tip of the iceberg, you can work your way under
the surface to identify the patterns of behaviour that led to
the event. From there, you can dive deeper to understand the
systemic structures that fostered those behavioural patterns.
Finally, you reach the mental models of the society that laid
the foundations for the event. Th e idea is that an intervention
at the level of mental models has the most leverage.
As with the Sustainability Compass, this model can be used
for the textbook writer, the teacher or the learner.
PYRAMID MODEL for exploring sustainability learning and action
Th e Pyramid Model is a way of looking for solutions to sustainability issues. We start at the bottom of
the pyramid and look at what is happening, why it is happening, what we can do and how we can do it.
As with the Sustainability Compass, this model can be used by the textbook writer, teacher or learner.
1. Event
4. Mental models
3. Systemic structures
2. Patterns of behaviour
1. What is happening/has just happened?
Climate is changing in the Alps.
2. Has it happened before or does it happen in other places?
Climate is changing at worldwide level. Climate has always changed but the change
is accelerating and reaching an amplitude that can induce major changes in our
livelihoods.
3. What are the forces at play contributing to these patterns?
The beginning of the accelerated change is related to the beginning of the industrial
era in western countries, now reinforced by production patterns of emerging
countries. It can be deduced that human activity plays a role in the current change.
4. How does our thinking allow this situation to persist?
The current economic and consumption-dominant models impede mitigation of our
impact on climate. Tackling this has the highest leverage.

school level, we could write to the principal to suggest building bikesheds or buying
canteen food locally.
3. We can act at an individual level (taking public transport or cycling, limiting our mobility,
living in a city centre rather than in a suburb with detached houses, buying local
products, etc) We can infl uence urban planning decisions (mixing commercial and
residential areas, avoiding planning low-density suburbs with poor access to public
transport, etc) through pressure groups or elections.
2. Mobility increases (more people own cars, urbanization causes people to commute further
to work, products are grown, manufactured and consumed in diff erent places, etc)
1. We produce too much pollution related to mobility

Link to the ESD pedagogical principles
Th is tool is ideal for working around the principle of refl ecting around values, critical thinking
but also dealing with systems. In showing underlying driving forces, it might foster creative
alternatives that look at the root of an issue. If an exercise is added whereby learners must think
of possible scenarios if a component of the system changes, the idea of facing the future with
creativity comes to play. And if the model can be used for further learning/exploring of the
world, it can again contribute to the principle of acquiring knowledge.

Examples of embedding in geography
textbooks
3.0
The natural hazards topic has been used to show what type of geographical content can contribute to ESD (see
section 1.2.1). A complete example around the water topic has been elaborated to show how to use the spiderwebs
for embedding ESD. This section presents further examples of ways to embed ESD in geography textbooks.
● A fi rst one shows how both spider-webs can be used, in this case for a topic related to urban planning
designed for very young children. This implies that a teacher’s guide is available: most of the information is
aimed at teachers because their pupils are not advanced in reading and writing.
● Further examples show how the spider-webs can be used for analyzing existing material and developing it
towards ESD:
– Five examples are extracted from textbooks that already address embedding to a certain extent. A
comment shows how this can be taken further. The topics tackled are: vital and secondary needs and their
impact on spatial organization; urban planning; mobility; agriculture; environmental confl icts.
– A last example shows how embedding can begin with a resource book’s existing content and then be
completed with geographical tasks following the ESD pedagogical principles. The topic is desertifi cation.
Aside from the fi rst example, the pragmatic focus on existing material aims to:
● Demonstrate that some existing material already embeds elements of ESD and can be used as inspiration
● Show that embedding ESD does not necessarily mean starting from scratch but that existing material can be
used as an entry point.
● Make explicit the articulation between existing practices and possible further embedding.
Link to the ESD pedagogical principles
Th is tool is ideal for working on facing the future with creativity and participation, helping to link
global issues with local actions (thus tackling scales). It requires a good understanding of a present
situation, thus mobilizing critical thinking, dealing with systems and refl ecting around values.
And again, according to how it is used, a contribution to acquiring knowledge can be seen.
Other resources provide more tools to help embed ESD in geography textbooks. These
include:
● The Part and the Whole from the Swedish International Center for Education for Sustainable
Development suggests ready-made activities for embedding ESD in geography, emphasizing
the idea of (global) public good: http://lun.gu.se/digitalAssets/1451/1451398_the-parts-andthe-

EMBEDDING EXAMPLE
Daily geographies for young children
Exploring the places of our ‘daily geographies’ (home classrooms, gardens, school buildings, etc) is a
possible fi rst step of geographical education. Th e spaces where we carry on our daily lives are the ideal
context for working on the basic spatial patterns defi ning our private and social geographies. Th ey help us
to understand the relation between places and their functions and to get in touch with the interrelations
between the diff erent actors who share these spaces. Exploring daily places can be considered preliminary
‘geographical work’. Moreover, school buildings are social spaces, they work through synergies and
interrelations between humans and natural environments. Understanding the balance and negotiations
underlying these synergies and interrelations deals with the values and meaning of sustainability. Th is
example shows how such elements can be integrated within a related chapter, looking at content fi rst and
then at a corresponding set of tasks.
Selecting content for the theme of daily geographies – chapter level (pre-primary)
Core question: Is our school people- and nature-friendly or can we make it so?
Sub-questions: Who is in our school and how is this refl ected in space? Is our school welcoming to
everyone? Is our school nature-friendly?
Localization: where and why there?
Looking at where the school is located in a district and understanding why it is located there is a
fi rst step towards ‘thinking geographically’ (see also next sub-section: ‘which human-environment
interrelations?’). At another scale, the relevance of the location of each place inside the school building
can be addressed: the classrooms, the corridors, the access points. Furthermore, it helps to consider the
role played by two spatial categories: distance and accessibility (see also ‘patterns and processes’). What
are the advantages of being located next to the corridor or to the playground? We gain time. We do not
have to cross all the building to get to the playground. We have more time for outdoor activities. Or why
isn’t the playground next to the carpark? Because it might be dangerous (security and pollution). Th is
kind of refl ection is an introduction to the relationship between places and their functions.
Contribution to ESD: ESD is about starting from our own daily experiences. Geography can contribute
to this by stressing the importance of understanding our private and social experience in daily life and
how crucial space is in infl uencing this. It is also a base from which to start refl ecting on how space
organization can be more or less inclusive and sustainable.
Which human-environment interrelations?
To analyze the physical environment of the school or to work on the bond children might feel with the
natural elements of their surroundings (a tree, a bird, the view of the lake, etc) can be a way to start addressing
these interrelations. Where is the school located (on a hill, on fl at land, near a river)? What implication does
that have (we only have a short walk to school because it is in the city near our homes but our playground
might have been bigger if we were in the countryside). Alternatively, to stay at school scale: what was done
to let the sunlight in? Is there a place that is windier? Is there any green space in the playground?
Contribution to ESD: Looking at the way we organize space in relation to our natural surroundings
allows us to introduce a core aspect of ESD – showing things as a system. Geography specifi cally
illustrates these interrelations in space by stressing the link between places, functions and rules, and
their relation to the natural environment.
Which human-human interrelations, which actors?
In exploring daily places, pupils deal with some very relevant spatial queries. Are we the only users?
With whom do we interact? Does everybody use the school the same way? Who decides if something
has to be modifi ed in the school building? Schools are, essentially, social spaces and studying them
‘as geographers’ means understanding the human-human relations aff ecting the private and collective
activities we carry out within these spaces.
Exploring daily places
can be considered
preliminary
‘geographical work’.
School buildings are
social spaces, they work
through synergies and
interrelations between
humans and natural
environments
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 135
Contribution to ESD: Becoming aware that space is shared by various actors and refl ects their needs
requires us to overcome an egocentric approach to our daily places and to negotiate with others possible
uses of space. Geographical education studies these dynamics in space and so brings an important
perspective on the idea of needs, equity and sustainability.
At what scales?
It is possible from an early stage on to work on diff erent spatial scales and their interaction. Children are
able to understand that their table (private space) is part of a classroom (familiar collective space), which
is part of the school (larger collective space), itself part of a district. Depending on which scale you are
considering, the geographical considerations can vary signifi cantly and a same issue might have diff erent
impacts at these scales. Why is our classroom nicely decorated but the corridor is not? Because we do
not have the same sense of ownership of the corridor, which is shared by more people, some of whom we
don’t even know. Or because we didn’t know we could decorate the corridor.
Contribution to ESD: Empowering our private sense of place at a local level can contribute to ESD
because it makes us feel responsible for a given place, which is the fi rst step towards responsibility.
From there, becoming aware of scales and their interrelations (my table, my classroom, my school) is a
further step linking local to wider scales, which is central to ESD. Moreover, looking at common spaces
(for example, the playground) and working on a sense of ownership of them encourages us to refl ect
on what is defi ned as ‘common’. This can be scaled up to worldwide common goods (for example, our
atmosphere), thus contributing to ESD.
What dynamic (patterns and processes)?
Understanding the role of accessibility and distance in using daily spaces is the fi rst step to introducing
the idea of geography as the study of structures and recurrent logics within space. Th e spatial organization
of the school building illustrates how the function of each place relates to a set of basic geographical
patterns: each classroom is structured in a similar way, except for the decoration, and there is a principal’s
offi ce in each school. Over the years, many playgrounds in urban areas have become smaller as a result of
school buildings increasing in size to accommodate larger numbers of children.
Contribution to ESD: Recognizing geographical patterns helps us to understand ‘the big picture’ and
leads to a level of generalization allowing for comparisons. The process aspect is crucial – keep in mind
that spatial organization is context-bound (in time and space) and might evolve to become more or less
sustainable. Looking at patterns and processes helps us to understand SD issues and look at possible
alternative evolutions.
Example of possible tasks within this subject (pre-primary school)
A possible set of tasks within this chapter would be to identify who is using the school (actors), what
their role and activities are and what spaces they use. Based on this, work would take place around issues
of well-being and integrative equity, always linking the questioning to spatial issues. A last step would
be to make the link between the way school is spatially organized and ways of connecting to natural
elements. Th is set of tasks is presented on the two next pages and is articulated around the following
ESD-related pedagogical principles:
● Bonding and stewardship. To discover a place from a new perspective and to refl ect possible
reorganizations of this space enhances the sense of ownership and familiarity.
● Dealing with systems. Learners become conscious that school is a social space with human
interrelations, built in an environment that has natural components.
● Facing the future with creativity. Learners have to imagine a solution for making the school more
inclusive and more prone to welcoming natural elements.
● Collaboration and communication. As each group of learners has to identify one actor and its
related use of space, the fi nal product depends on the work of everyone. Th e visualization suggested
starts working on ways to represent gathered data.
● Participation. In getting to know the roles of diff erent actors in the school, it is easier for learners to
imagine who has to be addressed if they want to implement change. According to the school and the
solutions suggested by learners, it might even trigger a change for real.
● Acquiring knowledge. By making an inquiry, learners start to become acquainted with investigation
tools and ways to represent results. Th e tools we use, queries we make and activities we undertake in
small places are the same ones we need to tackle neighbourhoods, parks, villages or urban areas.
Looking at patterns
and processes helps
us to understand SD
issues and look at
possible alternative
evolutions

Notes
Children at this age
are still learning
to read and write,
so the textbook mostly
gives instructions
to teachers, as
shown here.
Suggestion for a learning situation
Who is in our school and how is this refl ected in
the space?
Learning objectives – the learner is able to:
• Name at least three actors in the school and explain what their role is, one related activity they
carry out and one way in which they use space accordingly.
• Explain two ways of possible spatial reorganization within the school that favour social and
ecological inclusiveness.
MODALITY: Collaborative group work for step 1 (for example, groups of three learners do the
inquiry for one actor), individual for step 2.
CORE QUESTION: Is our school people- and nature-friendly or can we make it so?
Possible way of introducing the subject
‘OK class, do we think we really know our school?
Do we know it like a group of geographers
would? Do we know who is in our school, what
they do and in what kind of rooms they are?’
Th e teacher can start fi lling in the ‘school’ (see
picture) with what learners already know, or think
they know. Th e aim then will be to verify what has
been suggested and complete what is not known
by making an inquiry that will identify:
● Who is in the school => picture.
● What their name is => writing.
● What their role is (teacher, principal, school
nurse…) => writing.
● What activities are related to this work =>
writing and/or drawing.
● In what places they work and how these places
are organized => picture.
Th e ‘school’ is fi lled with the gathered data (some
parts can be written by the teacher if there is
too much to be written by learners of that age),
with corrections made where the learners’ initial
suggestions were not adequate.
A discussion takes place along the lines of
the following questions:
What can you observe? => For example, not
everyone uses space in the same way, it depends
on your role and your activities.
Do you feel at ease in the space you use or would
you rather be in one of the other identifi ed spaces?
Why? => For example, some children would like
to have the opportunity to go to a quiet corner for
reading because there is too much noise in class
and it is diffi cult to concentrate. You can then ask
if this could be implemented => For example, one
quiet corner could be implemented, but not one
for each child.
When this is done, the ‘school’ can be kept
in class or a picture of the result can be taken,
printed and distributed to the learners. A
concluding sentence based on the observations
is written down as a conclusion for this step,
such as: ‘Not everyone uses the school in the
same way, it depends on your role and your
activities. It is important to organise the school
so that everybody can work and study in it. Th is
is also true for other places.’
STEP 1
INQUIRY
Inquiry into actors,
their activities and
tools and how
they use space.

TEACHER’S PART
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 137
A concluding sentence can be written down to
answer the initial question: ‘Is our school peopleand
nature-friendly or can we make it so?’
An example of a possible concluding paragraph
would be: ‘Our school welcomes many diff erent
people who have diff erent needs and use space
accordingly. It also has some natural elements. It
is people- and nature-friendly but could be more
so. Possible measures would be to have wheelchair
access at the main entrance and to set up a small
garden in the playground. We would have to ask
permission from the principal and would need the
help of teachers in implementing that.’
STEP 3
THE RELATION
TO NATURE
A discussion takes place around what elements
of the natural environment learners like in or
around the school and why they like them. On the
worksheet ‘Is our school nature-friendly?’, learners
draw one of these elements. In a second step,
learners choose from elements presented on the
worksheet and imagine where within the school
area they could be implemented (in the courtyard
or in a quiet place just behind the school?) A map
of the school has to be provided by teachers.
A concluding sentence could be: ‘Natural elements
are part of the places I live in and infl uence my way
of living in them.’
STEP 4
CONCLUSION
1. Does everybody have a space in which to work
or is someone excluded?
2. Could people with disabilities work or study in
our school?
Introduce the worksheet ‘Is our school welcoming
to everyone?’ and discuss possible answers to the
fi rst question before letting the children write
them down. Th e other questions can be solved
individually and then discussed together, based
on what children have written/drawn.
A concluding sentence could be: ‘Th e way a place
is organised can be more or less inclusive.’
STEP 2
INCLUSIVENESS
Based on the inquiry
made in step 1,
discuss the two
following points:
STUDENT’S PART
Is our school welcoming to everyone ?
Would these two children have access to our
school?
If not, what could we do to make the situation
better? Write or draw a possible solution.
With whom would you discuss your idea if you
wanted to implement the measure you describe?

glued in). If one does not exist, it
can be roughly drawn by the teacher,
copied and glued in or drawn by the
students.

Turning existing ESD-compatible examples into
ESD examples
1st ESD-compatible existing example (primary school)
Th e following examples are extracted from a chapter on ‘housing and living’
from a recent textbook that has integrated elements of ESD. Th e fi rst activity is
an introductory exercise composed of the following steps (see French version
alongside 7).Learners are requested to:
1. Draw their dream ‘place to live’ (where would you like to live and how?) in
the blank space.
2. Explain why they would like to live in that place.
3. Say what is most important to them about living in that place.
Analysis
Th is worksheet aims to integrate the learner’s perspective, showing what
is important to them about housing (for example, one child might draw a
detached house with a big garden and a fence around it, while another might
draw an apartment with many children playing together in a communal
area). Th is will allow a link to be made between this perspective and various
aspects of the topic tackled later on. Th erefore, no content is worked on
here. At the level of pedagogical principles, looking at the diff erent drawings
enables learners to refl ect on values associated with what is considered ‘good’
housing and how that aff ects space. Moreover, pointing out that not everybody
considers the same things important introduces elements of critical thinking.
Th e next activity focuses on the
distinction between vital needs (at the
centre of the person) and secondary
needs (around the person) and how they
relate to space.
STEP 1
Th e learner has to draw lines between a
situation and its corresponding needs (for
example, ‘have a meal with friends in the
kitchen’ would be linked to ‘eat’ as a vital
need and ‘socialize’ as a secondary need)
or fi nd out a situation from given needs
(protection and sleep as vital needs =>
‘have a bedroom’).
A discussion takes place on the diff erence
between vital needs and secondary needs
and the sometimes blurred boundary
between both (according to the situation,
running away becomes vital). It is
observed that everybody has vital needs
but that secondary needs can be given
diff erent priorities. A link to the former
worksheet can be made, looking to what
needs the ‘dream house’ addresses.
Note
This kind of worksheet with
many blank spaces can be
replaced by an instruction
in the textbook – the
drawing can be made on
a separate sheet or in the
learner’s workbook.

Th e link to the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of the Child is made, showing that some of
these needs have been translated into rights. Having a shelter is one of them.
STEP 3
Needs are linked to rooms in a house. Conclusions: diff erent places in the house address diff erent needs
and so have diff erent functions. Housing meets numerous needs. In some situations however, there is
very little space and the same place meets nearly all needs.

the proportion of diff erent kinds of housing and the diff erent
ways of using space (for housing, transport, work and leisure).
Analysis
At the level of content, this extract focuses mainly on actors, their needs, perspectives and values, and
how these relate to space. Patterns and processes are looked at when addressing the national evolution
of needs related to housing, which also allows a change in scales. Aspects of localization are also tackled

2nd ESD-compatible existing example (primary school)
Th is part of the chapter addresses the
issue that space is not unlimited. Th is
implies that we need to refl ect on how
space is used: should we leave it to nature,
use it for agriculture, for an industry or
a shop, for parking, a soccer fi eld, for
housing? Th is exercise looks at diff erent
ways of using space for housing.
As a fi rst step, learners have to cut out
pictures of diff erent types of houses
(see image on left ) and design a new
‘ideal’ residential district, sticking the
houses on the voide peaces of land,
according to their own choices (see
image on next page). Each dwelling type
has information about the number of
inhabitants it can house as well as the
space required to build it (one or more
‘squares’). Learners are also asked to
draw some types of infrastructure (roads,
leisure venues, shops) but the choice is
left open. When done, learners count the
number of people who can live in their
district. Th ey compare their district with
those made by others to identify the
scenario that can house the most people
and the one that can house the least,
when looking at which part of the house corresponds to which need. At the level of pedagogical principles,
refl ecting around values is clearly worked on as secondary needs can be seen to be more or less important
to each individual. Here again, critical thinking is also tackled as underlying needs are looked at in space.
Contribution to ESD and further possible steps for embedding
Refl ecting on the diff erence between vital and secondary needs, their impacts on space and the values
underlying secondary needs is a core contribution to ESD, dealing with the basic needs of present and
future generations. Th e parallel to existing norms is also crucial, introducing a link between individual
and collective needs, and between the idea of needs and rights.
Further possibilities for embedding would be to set a focus on spatial scales and human-environment
interrelations. Th is would add elements related to global citizenship and peace, while addressing
potentially confl icting interests between individual needs and ecological issues:
● Add pictures and maps of the houses of children from other parts of the world. Ask learners to refl ect
on whether basic needs are being addressed in all the illustrations and what kind of secondary needs
can be identifi ed. Compare them with those identifi ed in the drawings made by the class in the
introductory activity.
● Add a picture of two to three animals in their habitat and mention some needs they have.
● Introduce a refl ection on concurring uses of space under the perspective of vital and secondary needs.
For example:
– Would you keep a swimming pool in your garden (secondary need) if you knew that a child down
the street had no house (primary need)?
– Would you rather have a big garden or leave some forest for the foxes?
Th e aim is not to moralize but to refl ect the tension between vital and secondary needs concurring in
space. ‘In-between’ alternatives can be discussed. For example, if all the children in the area have access
to the swimming pool, is keeping it more justifi ed, if having access to leisure pursuits is one of the
children’s rights?

looking at the type of houses built. Th ey
are also required to compare their district
with those given in the textbook (see the
image below) and to discuss the notion of
density. In the last step, learners refl ect on
the pros and cons of three scenarios with
diff erent densities from the point of view
of various inhabitants. Here, a link can
be made to the original ‘ideal house’ the
learners have drawn: should it be situated
in a densely populated area or not?
Analysis
At the level of content, this extract focuses
again mainly on actors and their various
ways of shaping a district according to their
worldviews. Th e main idea is to introduce
the idea of density in a given space that can
be planned in various ways. At the level of
pedagogical principles, looking at various
perspectives of ‘planners’ and the related
impact on space can open up towards a
refl ection around values (preference for
individual or collective ways of living
together, space left for green areas,
importance of leisure infrastructures) and
critical thinking. But the idea of planning
a district also addresses facing the future
with creativity.

Contribution to ESD and further possible steps for embedding
Considering the limits of a given space and refl ecting on the best ways to plan it is of great interest to
ESD. Th e subject can lead to refl ection on the carrying capacity of our planet. To go into more in depth,
it would be of interest to focus more on the human-nature interrelations. For example:
● Ask learners to fi nd a way to lodge the maximum number of people in this district so as to be able to
leave other spaces undeveloped. Th is must be done without aff ecting the carrying capacity of the area
regarding water supply and waste management. Th is means there is only a certain quantity of water
available to support a limited amount of people without depleting the resource, and only a certain
capacity to process the waste of a limited amount of people without damaging the environment.
Learners can choose between two limits, one with a cautious use of resources (limit set at X persons if
there is a conservative use of water and little waste is produced) and one with an unconscious use of
resources (limit set at Y if water is used as if it were unlimited and lots of waste is produced).
● Show images of four diff erent climatic environments. Ask learners to consider if the same density
makes sense everywhere, considering the diversity of environments (the carrying capacity diff ers from
one place to another).
● Require learners to empty two ‘squares’ of their former plan to foster urban biodiversity or leave
an area unpaved to enable the ground water to regenerate. Th e learners will have to decide which
infrastructures to ‘sacrifi ce’ and to consider the implications this will have for their district.
For older learners, it would be interesting to think of ways of using resources in a city and how this aff ects
space. An illustration like the one below could be studied and the learners asked to think of two planning
measures that could favour a circular system.

● Have a local waste incineration system or a local organic-based methane production infrastructure to
produce electricity from waste.
● Cluster industrial activities together so the heat produced by one industrial unit can be used by another.
● Create a mix of housing, work and leisure opportunities to reduce the distance between them and thus
reduce the use of fossil fuels related to transport.
Th e textbook can include examples of such cities, which have been analyzed from this perspective as a
previous step.
Considering the limits
of a given space and
refl ecting on the best
ways to plan it is of
great interest to ESD.

3rd ESD-compatible existing example (upper primary school)
Th is exercise is embedded in a chapter on mobility.
It looks at the reasons (work, leisure) for mobility
and its impacts (resource consumption, costs,
pollution but also increased accessibility to some
regions, increased economic activity). It describes
plans to build a new road to enhance traffi c fl uidity
and avoid vehicles driving through a village. Th e
impacts of this new road on various actors are
examined through speech bubbles. Th ey range from
positive impacts (economic development, increase
in tourism, decreased noise in the village, increased
security in the village, increased accessibility of
work) to negative ones (noise for nearby houses,
impact on local ecosystems, impact on landscape,
loss of good arable land, loss of economic activities
in the village). In a fi rst step, learners are asked to
categorize actors (road user or resident of the area
who does not use the road) so as to realize that a
road also aff ects the people who do not use it.
In a second step, learners are
required to identify advantages and
disadvantages of building a road,
looking at each actor and deciding if
they speak for themselves or a wider
group. If a new road is planned in
the area of the school, it is possible
to complete the worksheet with the
results of interviews made in the local
community (see the last two rows of
the table, left ).
Th e learners are then required to
take a stand, giving one argument
and stating if it is an individual or
collective viewpoint. A space is left for
a synthesis, which could be ‘Building
a new road has pros and cons,
depending upon the perspective of the
actor and the impact on environment.’
Analysis
At the level of content, this extract
focuses mainly on the impact of
a spatial action on actors, looking
at the multiplicity of perspectives
and refl ecting the tension between
collective and individual interest.
An opening is made towards the
human-environment interrelation by
evoking the impact on ecosystems and
landscape. At the level of pedagogical
principles, looking at possible
consequences of a spatial action has
elements of dealing with systems. Th e
multiplicity of perspectives as well
as an individual positioning helps to
address critical thinking.

Différents avis sur la construction d’une nouvelle route
La Confédération a prévu de construire
un nouveau tronçon d’autoroute entre deux villes.
Voici les témoignages de quelques acteurs
concernés par ce projet.
Actuellement, la route
principale reliant ces deux villes
traverse plusieurs villages. J’habite
dans l’un d’entre eux. La circulation
dans notre rue principale va fortement
diminuer, surtout celle des camions.
C’est très bien pour la sécurité
de nos enfants.
Denise
Comme conseiller d’Etat,
je suis très satisfait. Ce dernier
tronçon va relier notre région
au reste de la Suisse et
permettre notre développement
économique.
Jean-Marc
Cette autoroute doit
passer juste derrière notre
quartier. Le bruit va être
infernal. Je ne suis pas du
tout certain de vouloir continuer
à y vivre dans ces conditions.
Claude
A cause de cette autoroute,
les voyageurs ne passeront plus
par notre village. Qui s’arrêtera
encore dans ma station-service ?
Je vais pouvoir mettre la clé
sous le paillasson !

uer
Grâce à cette autoroute,
nous pourrons accueillir plus
facilement des touristes et faire
connaître notre ville. Je pense
que ma clientèle va augmenter,
surtout en été grâce
à notre terrasse.
Philippe
Non seulement
cette construction détruira
un marais qui abrite de
nombreuses espèces rares,
mais en plus, le paysage
sera gâché pour toujours !
Béatrice
Une bonne partie
de mes meilleures terres
vont disparaître à cause de cette
autoroute et je ne pourrai pas les
remplacer. Il n’est pas certain que
je puisse garder ma ferme.
Luc
Notre village
se trouve non loin de
ce nouveau tronçon d’autoroute.
Je mettrai moins de temps pour aller

dans mon village d’origine où les
appartements sont nettement
moins chers.

Contribution to ESD and further possible steps for embedding
Th is example contributes to ESD by looking at a variety of impacts the construction of a road can
have and the tension between individual and collective interest, thus working on social scales. Th e fact
that the learner has to give their opinion within these multiple perspectives fi ts well with the idea of
critical thinking and participation at the core of ESD. However, ESD could be embedded even further
by integrating elements relating to human-environment interrelations, spatial scales and patterns
and processes. By focusing more on critical thinking, dealing with systems and facing the future with
creativity, it questions the root of the problem in a way more in coherence with sustainable development
and, to a certain extent, global citizenship (see Figure 11: the Pyramid Model).
● Within the same exercise, two ‘speech bubbles’ could be added. One could mention the fact that
building new roads oft en increases traffi c, therefore solving the problem only in the short term. Th e
other could state that the related rise in CO2 emissions increases the risk of fl ooding in a coastal village
far away.
● A complementary task could present alternative measures, working around the question: ‘Could there
be other solutions to building a new road?’ Possible solutions to be discussed could be:
– To increase the accessibility of the village using public transport.
– To set up an internet platform where people can organize carpooling to reduce the numbers of cars
used every day.
– To improve the mix of housing, work and leisure activities in the area to reduce the need to drive.
– At an economic level, to work more closely with local producers to shorten the food supply chain
and reduce the transport of goods.
Th e learners would then return to the opinion they had formulated originally and take a renewed stand,
giving one argument for it.
4th ESD-compatible existing example (lower secondary school)
Th is exercise for Grade 8 students is based on a chapter that looks at various aspects of Kuttanad, a
leading agricultural region situated around Vembanad Lake in Kerala, south India. Kuttanad is a lowlying
region (below mean sea level) and the lake is surrounded by wetlands of national importance.
Th e region is prone to fl oods every year during the rainy season.
But before that, every summer, it is prone to the entry of salinity
from the sea through the lake. Th e fl oods induce a natural fl ushing
of pollutants and the increased salinity is good for the growth of river
and sea prawns as well as fi sh species. However, these two factors
have made cultivation a challenging task because they require
water to be pumped out to make cultivation possible. Moreover, the
water abundance makes only paddy cultivation feasible. Most of the
cultivated lands seen today are those that have been reclaimed from
the lake over a long period of time, implying a signifi cant decrease
in the lake’s surface.
Some major technological and chemical interventions have been
fostered by the state to shape Kuttanad into an intensive agricultural
area. Th ese include the introduction of pump sets (to pump out
water) and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Moreover, a
salt-water barrier has been constructed between the lake and the sea
(marked on the map as Th annermukkom Bund) and a spillway built
to control fl oods. Th ese interventions – particularly the last two – are
discussed in the chapter. Th e salt-water barrier curtails the entry of
saline water into the lake and the spillway reduces fl ooding. Th is has
helped farmers in Kuttanad by enabling them to grow an additional
crop in the dry season. But it has resulted in a decrease in the number
of prawns, fi sh and mussels. Moreover, it has curtailed the natural
fl ushing of pollutants, which now accumulate in the lake and deplete
the marine life. Th e accumulation of fertilizers in the lake waters have
resulted in the overgrowth and spread of water weeds that adversely
aff ect water transport and the everyday lives of the local people.

Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 145
Learners are requested to:
● Make notes and present to the class on the subjects of:
– saline water entry
– fl ood
– fi shing
– fertility of the region
● Refl ect on the technological and chemical interventions (the introduction of the pump sets, use of
chemical fertilizers and pesticides, construction of the salt-water barrier and fl ood-control mechanism)
and their impact on nature and people.
Analysis
At the level of content, this example focuses on human-nature interrelation, looking at environmental
depletion in a region of national ecological importance, and at how technical innovations and chemicals
aff ect the ecosystem and, in turn, the local community (the fi sher folk). At the same time, it shows an
increase in agricultural productivity important to another community (farmers). Th is considers actors
and related power relationships (between landowning farmers and landless fi sher folk, or between the
state and local communities). It indirectly tackles scale because the innovations might be seen as positive
from the perspective of the state but are detrimental to the local communities. Localization also plays a
role because the salt-water barrier has diff erent impacts on the south and north sides of the lake. At the
level of pedagogical principles, learners deal with systems as they examine the eff ects of technological
innovation on a territory and its inhabitants, eff ects with both pros and cons. Getting to know both
sides of a story, and looking at the impact on local biodiversity and fi sher communities, trains critical
thinking. By examining the opposing economic advantages and social and ecological risks, underlying
values are addressed.
Contribution to ESD and further possible steps for embedding
Th e impact on ecosystems and communities of technological measures linked to economic development
is an important issue of sustainability. For further embedding of ESD, work on the principles of facing
the future with creativity, fostering bonding and stewardship and acquiring knowledge (and to a certain
extent participation) could be added because the textbook is rooted in a local-to-regional context.
Learners could be asked to:
● Lead an inquiry among fi sher folk around the southern part of the lake to understand how they cope
with the situation and to fi nd solutions that take the natural environment and their own interest into
account. Discuss the results of the inquiry in class and then compare it with recent articles or studies
on the subject (for example www.zilient.org/article/kerala-fi shermen-tackle-pollution-clam-theft-protectwetland).
Write down one solution that allows the fi sher folk to make a living while respecting the
environment. Be clear about mentioning various sources, such as your interviews and recent articles.
Further verifi cation may be needed.
– Th is would enable the students to create a link to local communities to better understand their
perspective. It is also a way to see how local communities struggle to defend their interests while
considering the ecosystem, tackling issues of social and environmental justice. It has the potential
to increase ownership and responsibility, while looking at positive human-nature interactions as
well as at the power of participating in societal processes. Th is opens up possible solutions for the
future, linked to SD.
● Discuss with diff erent groups of people, such as farmers and fi sher folk, how they consider the option
of decommissioning of the salt-water barrier. Th is option is frequently discussed in Kerala. Based on
the results of your inquiry, hold a discussion in class to understand the various aspects, pros and cons
of such a move and write down the main elements.
– Th is task enables the students to use their earlier knowledge to imagine the future impacts of a
change to the system. Th is would deepen their understanding of the system around Vembanad
Lake. As this measure has not yet been taken, the learners’ debate will stand in parallel with
ongoing discussions in science and society, which is a situation they might encounter regularly if
participating in SD processes.

5th ESD-compatible existing example (upper secondary school)
Th is exercise focuses on an inquiry method to illustrate how investigation is a characteristic feature of
geographical education. Th e method is about identifying, analyzing and learning how to resolve a local
environmental confl ict. Th e textbook gives learners fi ve steps to follow to search for information, build
their knowledge (in groups of three or four) and propose a solution. Th e fi ve steps are as follows:
● Th e environmental confl ict. Identify a case study looking at local news (see Step 1).
● Th e object of the confl ict. Search for further information around this case study (newspaper/television,
internet, interview with identifi ed actors) to clarify the issue (see Step 2).
● Th e tipping point. Looking at the chronology of events, identify the point when a situation starts to be
confl icting. Look at what has led to this tipping point (see Step 3).
● Th e multiplicity of actors and settings. Reconstruct the chronology of the confl ict and the role of
diff erent actors in diff erent settings (see Step 4).
● What to do? Imagine possible solutions based on your analysis (see Step 5), trying to avoid reinforcing
the confl ict (see Step 4).

Analysis
Th e addressed content depends on the issue being
worked on but it will look at human-environment
interrelations because the exercise deals with
environmental confl icts. Th e method also fosters
a close look at actors and related power issues.
According to the confl ict, localization, patterns
and processes or spatial scale can also play a
role. All pedagogical principles are more or less
tackled by this exercise: the work on a local issue
fosters a sense of stewardship; the confl ict is seen
as a complex system based on a human-nature
relationship; the analysis of actors and related
power relationships addresses critical thinking
and a refl ection around values; facing the future
with creativity is required to imagine solutions;
the analysis of options for confl ict resolution
and the group work ties in with the idea of
collaboration and works on communication
skills; the given methodology is a help for
acquiring knowledge that can be used anywhere.
For this last point, see Figures 3 or 8 for other
examples.
As the textbook only indicates a method, the role
of the teacher is of crucial importance because
they off er guidance in the process and validate
the results of the inquiry (this is already true for
the suggestions made for the previous example). An example of a possible implementation of the method
can be given in a teacher’s guide but the content here is locally bound.
Contribution to ESD and further possible steps for embedding
Th is example looks at confl ict from the perspective of human-environment interrelations and power
relationships between actors having potentially confl icting needs, interests and/or worldviews, which
are recurring sustainability issues. It addresses many aspects, such as the value given to a resource or the
legislative setting of a confl icting situation, and introduces the idea of the tipping point, which is important
in ESD. Th e detailed method given for acquiring and analyzing geographical facts autonomously and the
fact that the example points out the complexity of an issue are further contributions to ESD. Although
this task already embeds many ESD-related elements, it would be possible to go further by:
● Comparing the imagined solution to the principles set out in the Earth Charter to decide whether the
proposal leans towards SD.
● Closing the loop by looking at the possible eff ects of the imagined solution on the natural context (see
Step 2).
6th ESD-compatible existing example: From a resource book to an
ESD textbook (upper secondary school)
Sprout: A Social Geography of Rajasthan is a resource book (including very few tasks) that focuses on
regional geography. Th e following extract on desertifi cation is examined and completed with a possible
set of related tasks.
Desertifi cation and restoration
Desertifi cation is the transformation of arable or habitable land into deserts, which could happen
naturally due to a change in climate or through human practices such as destructive land use. Th ese
imply a simultaneous transition of the landscape as well as of socio-economic relationships. Th e Space
Application Centre of Ahmedabad reports that in 2009, 66 per cent of Rajasthan was under the process
of desertifi cation. A number of reasons are seen to be causing desertifi cation, some of which are:
1. Mining. Th is economic activity involves the removal of the forest cover. Th is implies that the topsoil
gets washed away by wind and water, ultimately giving way to desertifi cation.
148 | GEOGRAPHY
2. Urban land use. Industrial waste, pollution and the construction of buildings and roads on water
drainage ways disrupt the natural fl ow of water.
3. Ground water depletion. Ground water is oft en pumped out at rates that are much faster than that at
which nature can replenish it. Th is causes desertifi cation of forests and farmlands.
4. Waterlogging. Th e Indira Gandhi canal was, among other things, constructed with the aim of
controlling desertifi cation by providing irrigation. It has increased arable land and given access to
drinking water to many people. But with time, water seepage from the canal has caused waterlogging
in numerous areas. At the same time, it has also brought to the surface the saline water that is found
deep underground in most parts of Rajasthan. When saline water comes to the surface then plants
cannot grow, which causes desertifi cation.
Mitigating measures have been undertaken since 1952, when the Desert Aff orestation Research Station
was set up in Jodhpur to control desertifi cation. Eff orts were made to plant trees and to fi x sand dunes.
Trees protect against soil erosion from wind and rain, enrich the soil (with their falling leaves) and
enhance existing humidity through evapotranspiration. Stopping dunes from moving helps to control
the expansion of desertifi cation.
At the same time, more and more voices underline that a number of practices in Rajasthan have traditionally
taken care to protect the desert environments. For example, the construction of water harvesting systems
such as kuis and kunds,7 which collect groundwater in small quantities or rainwater and keep it from
evaporating rapidly, are existing solutions for providing access to drinking water in not too densely
populated areas. Such solutions were neglected when piped water supply was initiated and canals were
constructed.
Adapted from Y. Sunny (2014), Sprout: A Social Geography of Rajasthan, Eklavya Publications, pp. 127–128
Analysis
Th e presented content looks at human-environment interrelations, in this case the impact of human
activities on desertifi cation. Th e phenomenon is presented as having multifactorial causes (which
require multifactorial solutions) and so is portrayed as a system with interrelated sub-systems. General
patterns and processes, such as over-pumping ground water, can be observed over the territory. At the
same time, the cause of desertifi cation diff ers according to where it occurs (for example, deforestation
or water logging), meaning localization plays a role. As there are no tasks, no pedagogical principles are
addressed but the type of content presented opens the way for dealing with systems.
Possible tasks
A very simple set of tasks, based on questions for learners to answer, can easily lead a step further into
embedding ESD. Within this set of tasks, the focus is on dealing with systems, critical thinking, facing
the future with creativity and acquiring knowledge. It also integrates the idea of scale at the content level.
Possible questions would be:
● Do you think planting trees and fi xing dunes will be enough to address desertifi cation in Rajasthan?
Justify your answer.
● Looking at the causes of desertifi cation:
– Find out one other measure that could be undertaken.
– Compare it with the measure suggested by your neighbour, clarifying how your measures would
fi ght desertifi cation, and discuss if they can have a negative impact (for example, by decreasing the
income of a group of people).
7 Kuis and kunds are underground wells, the former tapping groundwater or seepage from another source, the latter using a surface catchment
area intended to collect rainwater.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 149
8 This implies that learners have already tackled climate change, allowing them to make links between chapters.
– Choose one measure based on your discussion to present to the class, explaining why you chose it,
how it fi ghts desertifi cation and what negative impact it might have. Once the teacher has validated
the answers, write down the measures presented by the class in a table like this one.
Measure Ways in which it fi ghts
desertifi cation Possible negative impacts
– Choose the measure you think is the most eff ective, giving two reasons.
● Desertifi cation is also linked to the fact that climate is changing at a global level.8 Is there something
that could be done to mitigate the impact of global climate change in Rajasthan? Will remedial
measures taken only at the scale of Rajasthan help?
● What conclusion can you draw from all this? Write a summarizing paragraph. (An example for the
teacher’s guide: ‘Desertifi cation has many causes and many diff erent and complementary measures,
on both a local and global scale, are needed to tackle it eff ectively. Some of the measures have negative
impacts on certain actors, which have to be taken into consideration.’)
● You can then fi nd out if desertifi cation is an issue in your area. Look at its causes and at solutions that
might have been developed. Compare your results with what you have just seen in this chapter.

THE POWER OF WORDS to shape us and our world,
to determine our relationships with each other and to
our environment, has long been recognized. Eagleton
(1998) discusses this idea as he explores the rise of
English (literature) and its shaping of society. The
relationship between language and society is fully
expressed in the theories of language which posit the
idea, at varying levels, that the world is a construct
of language (see Saussure, 1978; Derrida, 1976,
as cited in Eagleton). Postcolonial literary theory,
for example, exposes the power of language as it
explores how long-lasting characterizations of nation
groups have been produced through language and
have led to their marginalization (see Said, 1978;
JanMohamed 1983). In addition, the relatively new
fi eld of ecocriticism uncovers how, through language,
various conceptualizations of the environment
have been produced, evoking particular feelings,
attitudes, perspectives and values in regard to the
environment. In fact, ecocriticism, with its emphasis
on ways of reading and writing the environment and
human beings’ relationship to it, displays the power
of language to shape our responses to our world.
More currently, the authority of language has been
seen in the impact of social media and marketing in
determining who holds power and who does not in
our societies. The implication of this for education
for sustainable development (ESD) is that language
provides a tool for shaping the world as desired.
In looking specifi cally at the language of English for
ESD, we are, however, mindful of English’s historical
dominance in the colonizing process, of ‘installing
itself as a “standard” against other variants which are
constituted as “impurities”’ (Ashcroft, Griffi ths and
Tiffi n, 1997, p. 283). Yet as Brathwaite (1997, p. 284) in
the same text has argued, the production of ‘Nation
Language’ in the Caribbean region demonstrates the
vigorous success of linguistic variations of English.
Equally important is the position taken by the
Caribbean poet and Nobel Laureate, Derek Walcott,
who asserts that the ‘English language is nobody’s
special property. It is the property of the imagination:
it is the property of the language itself,’ (Walcott,
1986). Interestingly, in the German Curriculum
Framework, Education for Sustainable Development
(2016), English is identifi ed as the most important
medium of global language, although, admittedly,
not the only one (p. 164). The Position Paper of the
National Focus Group on Teaching of English in India
(2006) also affi rms the importance of English: ‘English
is in India today a symbol of people’s aspirations
for quality in education and a fuller participation in
national and international life,’ (p. 1).
We are also aware that the dominance of English
can pose a threat to linguistic minorities. The Global
Education and Monitoring Report 2016, in drawing our
attention to the need for addressing inequality, lists
linguistic minorities among the vulnerable groups
being discriminated against. Moreover, language in
education policies can be a source of wider grievances.
In multi-ethnic countries, the imposition of a single
dominant language as the language of instruction
in schools, while sometimes a necessity, has been a
frequent source of grievance linked to wider issues
of social and cultural inequality (UNESCO, 2016). By
one estimate, over half the countries aff ected by
armed confl ict were highly diverse linguistically,
making decisions about the language of instruction
a potentially divisive political issue (Pinnock, 2009;
Global Education Monitoring Report, 2016, p. 127).
Yet English, despite its hegemonic relationship to
other languages, which may produce tensions and
divisions, is a global language – a lingua franca – and

one of the six offi cial languages of the United Nations.
As such, English off ers the world a space in which
we can speak to each other and build relationships
across borders. In considering, therefore, the value
of English for sustainable development, peace
and global citizenship, we note that one of its key
attributes is the opportunity it presents for building
bridges across diff erent linguistic communities, for
creating a common ground among diverse groups
of people and so enabling eff ective communication.
There are, of course, other language issues that we
need to consider as we engage with using language
as a tool for ESD. These include how to use language
to build social inclusivity, for example, how to ensure
that the gender use of English does not exclude or
privilege one gender. In addition, there is the issue
of cultural context. Language is a tool of culture and
identity. Language teaching and learning must now
emphasize the importance of culture, particularly in
teaching English as a second language or a foreign
language – the culture of the learner is expected to
provide the context even as other cultures or English
culture is acknowledged. We also have to attend to
the use of language specifi c to diff erent disciplines, for
example, the technical, specialized language of science.
There is, therefore, the need for ‘translation’ to reach a
wide community of readers and to ensure inclusivity
(see the Science chapter for a discussion on science
and language).
How then do textbook authors embed ESD in
language? In this chapter, we discuss fi rst the
potential contribution of language to ESD, peace
and global citizenship and then how to ensure this
contribution is made, in other words, how to infuse or
embed ESD in language textbooks.
In addition, we recognize the varieties of English
that exist and their various relationships: English
as a foreign language; a second language; a native
language; the offi cial language in places where other
languages or mother tongues exist and English as
a lingua franca – a global language. The guide for
embedding ESD in English language textbooks,
however, does not distinguish between these groups
and aims instead for a general view that will be
applicable to all at various levels.
Traditionally, the thrust of language teaching
and textbooks has been to develop eff ective
communication skills. To do this, the language skills
of reading, writing, listening and speaking have been
the focus of language teaching. More specifi cally, the
learning of these skills has meant the promotion of
critical thinking skills, the practise of various types of
discourse and the accurate use of language in terms
of grammar, structure and mechanics. By possessing
these skills, individuals have the fundamentals for
eff ective communication. To some extent, language
textbooks have also traditionally delivered content
for ESD. Prose fi ction, poetry and drama have
addressed sustainable development themes, issues
and topics at varying levels.
Language teaching and textbooks can, however,
contribute signifi cantly more to ESD.
With the inclusion of the vision for a peaceful, just
and ecologically sustainable environment, language
content can be more focused on sustainability. In
eff ect, the ‘open content space’ in language can be
used to embed sustainable development themes,
issues and topics. By including authentic and realworld
materials and tasks, the connection between
classroom and community is strengthened. As a
result, students learn to attend to their community
and to become active local and global citizens (see
Down, 2010).
Language can also contribute to ESD through the
development of critical thinking skills. This will
help learners to be more fully prepared to read and
interpret their world accurately and to discern truth.
Learners will, for example, identify stereotyping/
racial profi ling that can lead to injustice, comprehend
‘basic’ science and economic facts that will prepare
them to address environmental, social and economic
crises, and recognize the various fallacies in public
Language can
also contribute to
ESD through the
development of critical
thinking skills. This
will help learners to be
more fully prepared
to read and interpret
their world accurately
and to discern truth
Language, as we discussed earlier, can contribute to ESD by using its power to ‘create’ the world that is desired.
To do this, we must pay close attention to the functions of language.
The primary function of language is to communicate. Using a lingua franca such as English, which people learn
so as to communicate with each other eff ectively, can enable the building of a global language community with
a shared understanding of people and place. This, in turn, enables the development of a common understanding
of the concept and practice of sustainability.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 159
debate that would seek to obscure the threat posed
to human survival by current human activity.
Enabling learners to make informed decisions
and take action as responsible global citizens is
also another way in which language can prepare
a society to address sustainable development
issues. Critical thinking and interpretation skills can
be honed by reading literature. The clarifi cation
of values, the development of empathy and
being open to multi-perspectives – including a
future’s perspective – can be encouraged. Equally
important, students can explore representations
of, and humans’ relationships to, the environment
intimately through literature.
The path to sustainability requires people to make
substantial changes in the way they perceive and
shape the world. Language as a ‘power tool’ can
enable such changes. Through exercises, activities
and tasks using language for peace, social justice
and advocacy, language textbooks can advance
the world’s movement towards sustainability. And
imbricated in this is language learning that provides
the opportunity for people to know who they are
and how to live together. Language learners can
thus be enabled to create a sustainable world.
All the possibilities that language off ers will be
discussed fully when we look at how to eff ect them
in section 3.
What is abundantly clear, is that more is required
of our language textbooks and language teaching if
we are to employ English more fully to help transform
our societies.
Textbook writers and publishers of English language
textbooks, therefore, have an important role to play
in creating a sustainable society. In the pages that
follow, we will discuss specifi c ways to embed ESD in
language textbooks and so help to usher in, through
language, positive changes for our world. These
specifi c ways are to:
Use content in language through the ‘open content
space’.
● Ensure the inclusion of authentic materials and
tasks so that there is a strong relationship between
the classroom and communities and a real-world
connection between language textbooks and
society. (Authentic materials and tasks are defi ned
as materials used and tasks done in everyday life.)
Recognize and use language as a ‘power tool’ to create
a peaceful, just and ecologically sustainable world.
● Develop language as an eff ective tool for
communication and advocacy for ESD.
● Use language for peace (non-violence and
non-discrimination).
● Use language to address social justice.
● Develop language as a tool for identity by
incorporating non-English mother tongues in the
English language textbook.
Use literature to enable learners to make informed
decisions and take action as responsible global citizens.
● Develop through literature critical thinking and
interpretation skills.
● Clarify values through literature so learners
become aware of the values needed to create a just
and a sustainable environment.
● Develop through literature empathy and the ability
to see varying perspectives, including a future’s
perspective.
● Explore through language with literature:
(i) representations of the physical environment and
its relation to social and economic environments;
(ii) human beings’ relationships with the physical
environment so the environment is a key focus.
It is abundantly clear
that more is required
of our language
textbooks and
language teaching,
if we are to employ
English more fully
to help transform
our societies

Embedding ESD in language textbooks
– principles, tools and approaches
3.0
The examination of several language textbooks
reveals the gaps that exist in terms of an ESD focus.
Many books do not explicitly express in their
objectives or content the big goal of enabling
eff ective communication among peoples and of using
language to build sustainable societies. Many books
speak of teaching grammar, the mechanics of English
and writing and reading skills. Some may, for example,
take a thematic approach that uses students’ interests
to teach English. John Warriner’s English Composition
and Grammar, one of the most comprehensive
language texts, identifi es the purpose of the textbook
as helping students master the skills required for the
eff ective use of standard English to help them speak
and write better English. The Kaleidoscope series, in
its Teacher’s Guide (Ginn), takes it a step further. The
writers make the point that language education is not
just to teach pupils about language but also to help
them learn through language. It is, however, in the
English Alive series (Nelson Thornes) that we see a goal
that comes closer to that of a text for ESD. In this series,
the writers include as one of their aims: ‘presenting a
moral purpose common to all major religions when
that is possible’. The qualifi er, ‘when that is possible’,
suggests its secondary status and the text itself may
be said to address that goal only incidentally. The
text series in which English language teaching and
learning appears to be most oriented towards ESD
is that of the Notting Hill Gate 6A Advanced Course
textbook. We will look more closely at this text in our
discussion of the principles for and approaches to
embedding ESD.
The principles that guide embedding ESD in language
textbooks are (these have been expanded already in
section 2):
Principle 1 Include SD content in language by
using the ‘open content space’.
Principle 2 Recognize and use language as
a ‘power tool’ to create a peaceful, just and
ecologically sustainable world.
Principle 3 Use literature to enable learners
to make informed decisions and take action as
responsible global citizens.
These principles are all aligned to ESD principles/
competencies, which have been discussed in the
Introductory chapter.
Box 1

and clarifi cation; developing empathy;

Use the ‘open content
space’ in language for
sustainable development
content
Principle 1
In discussing this principle, we look at:
● Embedding sustainable development content in
the ‘open content space’ in language textbooks.
● Ensuring the inclusion of authentic materials and
tasks so there is a strong relationship between
the classroom and communities, a real-world
connection between language textbooks and
society.
Knowledge about and for sustainable development
has been identifi ed as an ESD competency that
learners need to acquire. Language off ers a place
for sustainability concepts, ideas and issues in what
we refer to as the ‘open content space’. Content,
other than language-specifi c content, is required to
teach language and to develop the competencies.
Conventionally, textbook authors and language
teachers have organized this content along themes
or according to general interest – and sometimes
this selection appears to be very idiosyncratic. This
In this section, we will explore how to embed ESD in language textbooks and so realize language’s potential to
contribute to sustainable development. We propose that embedding ESD in language textbooks will advance
the teaching of English beyond simply teaching a skill. It deliberately employs English to create a better society.

is, however, clearly a space in which sustainable
development ‘content’ can be inserted. Topics
could include climate change; peace; planetary
boundaries; environmental degradation; fair trade;
equity; poverty and hunger. Or topics can be
based on developing an appreciation for (and an
understanding of) place as the social, economic,
physical and cultural issues are explored. The United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals website1
can be used as guide for such selections, especially
as each goal is accompanied by global narratives
that refl ect on it. (The Introductory chapter and the
UNESCO website What is ESD?2 also suggest criteria
for selecting sustainable development topics. See
also The Great Derangement by Amitav Ghosh).
In selecting content, textbook authors will draw on
other disciplines and, at times, will need to ‘translate’
the technical language of the discipline into
language appropriate for their target learners (see
the Science chapter for a discussion of the language
of science).
The idea of using the ‘open content space’ in
language is illustrated in the approach of Jessie
Singer and Ruth Shagoury, who created a unit on
social activism when teaching literacy skills to a
group of adolescents (Singer and Shagoury, 2006).
Singer and Shagoury tell how, through teaching
reading and writing, they created a unit that tasked
students to explore issues of equity. By selecting
reading material by South African writers, such as
Kaffi r Boy by Mark Mathabane, as well as short stories
by Peter Abrahams and Nadine Gordimer, they
introduced their students to international literature
that explored issues of race, equity and identity.
The students’ literacy skills were developed as the
teachers provided guidance on how to understand
diffi cult texts and their writing skills were honed. By
integrating their approach into reading and writing
instruction, Singer and Shagoury provided the
foundation for students to engage in social activism.
What we observe here is the transformation of a
literacy class by the selection of texts that deal with
real-world sustainability issues and tasks that require
students to take action not just in the classroom but
in wider society. The teaching of literacy skills – how
to read and interpret, how to write eff ectively and
accurately – laid the foundation for this. In other
words, the students were given the ‘big purpose’
of literacy, showing it to be a way to understand
the world and a means to transform that world.
Therefore, a language textbook with ESD embedded
will, by teaching language skills, also have content
and activities related to sustainability issues.
The textbook Notting Hill Gate 6A Advanced Course
and examples at the end of this section also
illustrate this use of ‘open space’. The themes and
topics in the examples are based on Sustainable
Development Goal 16 (peace and justice) as well
as the sustainability theme of ‘appreciating place/
community and engaging with community or taking
action for community’. In the Notting Hill Gate 6A
Advanced Course textbook, one unit engages with
the sustainability theme ‘economy and social justice’,
specifi cally fair trade. The unit is titled Global Economy
and Sweat Shops and has sub-topics such as ‘fashion
facts’. Tasks include conducting research on ‘clean
clothes campaigns’.
Another example of using the ‘open content space’
of English teaching is the Learning English Through
Social Issues Resource Package (Sek 2007)3 developed
for the senior secondary curriculum in Hong Kong. A
variety of language points – causation expressions,
comparison of perspectives, debating skills – are
taught through the discussion of social issues. The
social issues chosen in the package include common
topics such as homelessness, deforestation, obesity,
the right to life versus the right to die, but textbook
writers could easily choose issues that are more
relevant to their respective target audiences. The
authenticity and relevance of topics are among the
most eff ective factors in motivating learning. Given
that issues relating to the sustainability of society
naturally concern everyone, students are able to
see the purpose of acquiring the language skills
necessary to tackle them. To encourage students
to discover more about the topics by themselves
and use more of the target language outside class,
research skills – such as how to conduct interviews,
record observations and design surveys – can also
be included. This gives students ownership of their
learning and exemplifi es the complementary nature
of language teaching and ESD content embedding.
The Hong Kong example shows the critical issues
that can inform the content material for language
textbooks with the goal of developing students’
social, economic and environmental knowledge.
It also suggests ways of encouraging students to
change perspectives and to take action to address
these issues while teaching the specifi c language
skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing.
Using today’s critical issues as content to develop
these language skills indicates how ESD can be
embedded in a language textbook. Moreover, it
shows how language teaching can be used to help
create a better world.
It is important to note, however, that including
sustainability issues and themes does not mean

excluding conventional themes, such as love, birth,
death and growing up. In fact, these themes are
extended and deepened because the sustainable
development content opens up a wider sphere of
concerns, takes a holistic view of life and encourages
a greater connectivity between students and their
community. Moreover, by giving students a ‘template’
whereby language skills are taught through the
consideration of local and global survival issues, they
will be able to continue the work in their communities
long after class is over.
There is, however, a possible limitation to the use of
‘open content space’. At present, language education
in Europe is moving more than ever towards being
integrated into other content areas and disciplines in
the curriculum, instead of being taught in dedicated
language classes (Thurmann, 2013). However,
although the value of this approach has long been
recognized, its limitations can be seen if it becomes
the sole means of delivering language education.
For textbook writers focusing on English as a second
or foreign language, this approach is not viable.
Moreover, the curricula for primary and secondary
schools in many countries have dedicated sessions for
language education. These require English language
textbooks, not just subject content texts featuring
aspects of language teaching.

Use language as a ‘power
tool’ to create a peaceful,
just and ecologically
sustainable world
Principle 2
In discussing this principle, we look at developing
language as an eff ective tool for:
● Communication.
● Critical thinking.
● Peace.
● Social justice.
● Advocacy.
● Identity.
The path to sustainability is one that requires substantial
changes to the way we perceive and shape our world.
Language has the power to infl uence this signifi cantly.
Through language we can help to create and construct
a peaceful, just and ecologically sustainable world.
As discussed in section 2, this involves developing
eff ective communication and critical thinking skills,
learning to create through language a peaceful
environment, employing language to address social
justice issues, recognizing the power of language for
advocacy and understanding language as a means to
develop one’s identity.
3.2.1
Developing language as
an eff ective tool for the
communication of ESD
Developing an eff ective tool for communication
is the overarching and specifi c goal of language
education. As discussed in section 2, English can
build a common ground on which we can share
information, ideas, emotions and create connections
between diverse groups of people. When used as an
eff ective tool, language also helps to clarify ideas and
emotions and, in general, helps people to understand
themselves, others and their environment.
The need to communicate eff ectively has acquired
a certain urgency given the growing need to
deal with complex issues such as high levels of
consumerism in a world of fi nite natural resources,
the growth in technology and its devastating eff ects,
and immigration and the refugee crisis. Language
textbooks, now more than ever, need to focus on
providing information, tasks and exercises that teach
students how to communicate their ideas, opinions
and emotions in ways that will open a dialogue that
leads to the ‘truth’.
Exercises for creating and analysing dialogue on a
number of sustainability issues are crucial. By making
references to TV shows and using material from
websites, journals, magazines and other sources, such
as the Global Oneness Project,4 textbook writers can
prompt discussion of real-world topics. These could
include extreme weather conditions, energy sources
and fracking, consumption, land use (housing versus
farmland and forests) or refugees and migration.
Textbook writers can provide students with questions
that help them probe what is being communicated,
how it is being communicated and off er them ways
of discerning the ‘truth’ in such dialogues.
Textbooks will also need to include topics that raise
the issues of ‘how, what and when’ to communicate.
What is the best way to communicate a message?
When is the best time? What type of language
should be used, what diction, tone, emotive words,
metaphorical language should be used? Students
also need to learn the importance of identifying
their target audience, the ‘receivers’ of their
communication. Practice in identifying what an
audience needs and what the sender wants them to
do with the information sent is also important.
A useful exercise would be to provide students with
the facts about a critical issue such as biodiversity
Language textbooks,

and exercises that

loss (or any of the other sustainability issues listed
in section 2) and then ask them to create a short
presentation on it. They will need to determine the
audience, the language to be used and the discourse
form (for example, narrative, exposition) and the
presentation format. Most important, students
should be encouraged to see the urgency of their
task and be prepared to communicate in a clear way
the appropriate content of the critical issue.
Another important textbook task is that of introducing
the students to the process of communication and
helping them to understand the possible barriers
to eff ective communication. Practice exercises in
active listening; recognizing verbal and non-verbal
communication; engaging in pro-social behaviour
(being polite, respectful, waiting one’s turn); learning
to negotiate, persuade and infl uence; learning the
language of confl ict resolution and mediation are all
important in developing students' communication
competencies. These exercises can take the form of
games followed by in-depth refl ection/processing.
Process drama provides another means of engaging
and refl ecting on communication lessons (see Bowell
and Heap, 2001).
A number of these communication topics are
present in language textbooks. There needs to be,
however, more emphasis on the development of
communicative skills so that students are prepared
to be better communicants. Given the mass of
information that people now have to process, the
resulting mental confusion and the tension of living
in this century, it is essential to have more open
and honest communication. It is from such quality
communication, and listening actively to hear
another’s point of view (rather than just listening to
respond), that wholesome human relationships can
develop. And it is from here that understanding and
connecting with self, others and place can develop the
foundation for a peaceful, just and safe world.
3.2.2
Developing critical thinking
skills through language
for ESD
To build eff ective communication, we need to
develop critical thinking skills. Their importance
to sustainability has been emphasized in the
Introductory Chapter. This is also a major part of
language education and is seen, in its most basic
form, in the teaching and learning of comprehension
skills at the literal, inferential and evaluative levels.
The development of these skills can help students
make sense of complex subjects, such as sustainable
development. In fact, the complexity of sustainable
development can be seen in the many ways the
concept has been interrogated. Nolet (2016), for
example, questions the moral prerogative of those
who have benefi ted from development to determine
if and how others should benefi t. Sachs (2016) raises
the issue of population growth and a fi nite earth and
Satterthwaite (2009) responds to that issue by asking
if it is more a matter of a growth in consumers.
Such multifaceted and intricate issues demand a
public that is not only well informed but that has
been taught critical thinking skills. More than ever,
the teaching of such skills must be deepened. Sterling
(2010 p. 33) argues that for a transformative learning
experience, the following thinking skills need to be
emphasized:
Holistic: ‘how does this relate to that?’, ‘what is the
larger context here?’ Critical: ‘why are things this
way, in whose interests?’ Appreciative: ‘what’s good,
and what already works well here?’ Inclusive: ‘who/
what is being heard, listened to and engaged?’
Systemic: ‘what are or might be the consequences
of this?’ Creative: ‘what innovation might be
required?’ Ethical: ‘how should this relate to that?’,
‘what is wise action?’, ‘how can we work towards
the inclusive well-being of the whole system –
social, economic and ecological?’ Practical: ‘how do
we take this forward with sustainability in mind as
our guiding principle?’
Language education with an ESD perspective
off ers textbook writers deeper levels on which
comprehension questions are usually based. The
literal, inferential, critical, appreciative and evaluative
can be expanded to refl ect more of what Sterling
has highlighted.
The exercise that follows illustrates how language
textbook authors can develop critical thinking skills
with sustainable development in mind. Textbook
authors could select a sustainable development issue,
for example, environmental loss and poverty. The
tasks selected could include brainstorming to fi nd
out what students already know about the issue and
to identify their views of existing opinions, attitudes
and claims. This could then be followed by viewing a
video. In this exercise, the YouTube video suggested
is Massa God Fish Can Done, a documentary from the
Nature Conservancy, which introduces students to
the cyclical problem of over-fi shing, the destruction
of the fi shing industry and the poverty of the fi shers.
Using open-ended and guiding questions, the
exercise would require students to think about the
situation in the video holistically by having them
consider the larger context and the local situation
in connection to the global context. Students could
also be asked to review their own as well as received
opinions on the subject by having them consider
how ideas about poverty are refl ected or contested
in the video. They could then be engaged in looking
for connections between the socio-economic issue of
poverty and the environment.
164 | LANGUAGE
An extension of the exercise would have them analyze
the video further by thinking about the causes and
the eff ects of the situation and how those eff ects also
lead to the causes.
Figure 1: Th e interrelation of cause and eff ect
Students could then be asked to think ethically,
creatively and practically as they identify solutions
that could save the fi sh and remove the threat of
poverty from the fi shers. Refl ection on the process
of comprehending the situation, which could then
follow, would provide students with a ‘template’ for
thinking critically about other issues.
Complementing this, students could be asked to
analyze a current news headline or story related to
fi shing, such as ‘Massive Basa fi sh processing plant
opens in St Elizabeth today; over 100 jobs and
counting’ (The Jamaica News Observer, 20 January
2017), in light of the aforementioned video. The
language exercise now moves into the area of
media literacy. The exercise could ask students to
list questions that seek answers to fi ll the gaps in the
story; to identify the perspectives of the narrative; to
refl ect on who benefi ts and how much; to consider
the environmental and employment implications.
The photograph accompanying the news story
could also be content for students to analyze. In this
regard, students could be given guiding questions
that help them to analyze media photos, for
example, who or what is in the photo? Who or what
takes centre stage? Why? How? What is the eff ect of
this? What is omitted from the photo? What appears
on the margins?
The language textbook exercises described here
engage students with sustainable development
content while developing their critical thinking
skills. In eff ect, they provide an opportunity for the
students to apply their critical thinking skills to a realworld
situation.
3.2.3
Using authentic texts and
real-time engagement
We also wish to emphasize the importance of the
authenticity of the material. Students are being
invited to ‘read’ their local and/or global community
in real time. Language textbook writing exercises
could follow a similar pattern. The language
specifi cs of types of writing (expository, narrative,
argumentative, creative), sentence structures,
target audience or grammar and mechanics could
be combined with writing tasks that are directly
connected with students’ communities beyond the
classroom. Students could be asked to write on the
subject of fi shing for their school newsletter, make a
poster for their community on the dangers of overfi
shing or prepare a piece for their school’s Facebook
page. Interviews with local fi sher-folk could also form
the basis for their own video or news story.
Engaging students in language classes often requires
an active approach to language teaching. When
students see that their writing has a real audience,
has a purpose beyond gaining a grade and connects
to a vision of transforming their world, they are
more likely to attend to that work than they would
otherwise. English language textbooks that engage
students in this way will exemplify a language text
with ESD embedded.
3.2.4
Media literacy – another
way to develop critical
thinking skills
Given the complexity of the news, the various ways
in which information is presented and the infl uence
of diff erent interest groups, English can enable
the development of media literacy. Sustainable
development goals and issues often engender
much public debate because they challenge huge
corporations with vested interests in maintaining
the status quo. Climate change, for example, has
given rise to huge debates, with some people, even
today, still questioning its reality. Language textbook
activities can help students learn to analyze the
language of the media to detect fallacies and vested
interests and learn who to trust in this critical era.
‘All media aren’t created equal,’ Paul Fleischman
(2014, p. 154) has asserted. And language as a
medium can be employed to test that. Language
includes the necessary tools to identify bias, circular
arguments, assumptions and emotive diction to strip
language itself to its essentials – the facts. Exercises
on this aspect – language and logic – are generally
included in teaching persuasive writing/building the

argument. Debates and discussions usually provide
opportunities for practice here. The lesson on the
subject of peace and confl ict later in this chapter
includes one such exercise.
3.2.5
Using language for peace
In this section, we uncover the power of language
to shape our thoughts, our feelings and to construct
our reality. We highlight, specifi cally, peace and
social justice as they are two key components of the
concept of sustainable development and ESD.
Textbook writers engaging with language for
peace can make concrete many of the ideas and
principles identifi ed in the Preamble to the UNESCO
Constitution. The Preamble tells us that ‘since wars
begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men
that the defence of peace must be constructed’.
The Preamble thus states that war and peace are
foremost constructs of language. Desires become
translated into thoughts, thoughts into words and
words into action. This picture is further detailed in
the UNESCO publication Peace Education, Framework
for Teacher Education.5 Viewing peace holistically, the
writers describe total peace as a combination of inner
peace, social peace and peace with nature. That
such acts are represented and mediated through
language points to language’s potential to create
peace or war. The text, moreover, argues for the
development of skills in critical thinking and problem
solving for peace.
One of the major contributions that language can
make to ESD is by focusing on the use of language for
peace. In this case, language addresses Sustainable
Development Goal 16 (peace, justice and strong
institutions). The childhood rhyme, ‘Sticks and stones
may break my bones but words will never hurt me,’
has been proved to be spurious time and again – by
spreading hatred, words can hurt and cause death.
Yet words also have the power to heal. There is a
language of peace and it is one we need to use
if we are to bring peace. Through this language,
as Rebecca Oxford (2013) affi rms, we are off ered
the possibility for transforming our societies. The
language of peace enables us to defuse situations of
violence, deal eff ectively with confl ict and improve
our relationships generally. She also points out the
language of peace not only off ers us the vocabulary
for conversing about peace but has transformative
qualities. Oxford describes it as a language
with many diff erent tones: friendly, respectful,
reverential, ecstatic, gently consoling and artistic.
The possibilities for including this in the language
textbook are many. Textbook writers could consider
exercises in which students brainstorm, research and
display peace words using diff erent media. Students
could also be asked to identify or create dialogues
with tones that are friendly, respectful, reverential,
ecstatic, gently consoling and artistic as a way to
learn to use language with tones that are peaceful
(see also Ghosen, 2005).
Describing several peace-building activities that
employed story-telling and drama, Modi (2014b)
observed that they challenged the idea that ‘the
English language classroom is meant only for the
de-contextualized transmission of skills or the
polishing of grammar and vocabulary’. He suggests
that we use questions at the level of recall, inferencing
and critiquing in order to help students to discern
diff erent perspectives and refl ect on important
subjects such as compassion, care and loyalty using
There is a language
of peace and it is one
we need to use if we
are to bring peace

166 | LANGUAGE
stories and drama. Modi’s comments indicate the
kind of activities that can or should be included in
language textbooks with an ESD perspective.
In addition to this, textbook authors in engaging with
language for peace should consider emphasizing
the language needed for social behaviour. At a
basic level, this includes language for simple social
courtesies: ‘How are you?’ ‘Nice day.’ ‘Have a good
one.’ ‘Thank you.’ Yet such simple social uses of
language – uses that could be perceived as nothing
more than insignifi cant rituals – can create harmony.
The language of social courtesy acknowledges
others and creates a space for community. A society’s
dismissal of this function of language can, in fact,
lead to a loss of opportunity for connecting and
valuing the simple existence of others.
Language for pro-social behaviour, as described in
Speaking the Language of Peace (Duff y, 1995), provides
an extension of that basic language function. The
writer addresses language for pro-social behaviour,
such as cooperation, collaboration, affi rming others
and expressing feelings in ways that do not hurt
others, as well as behaviour that promotes peace.
We also think of the role of language in other social
interactions – such as disagreeing with someone,
making a complaint, being critical, responding to
criticism – and consider how language can be used
to promote harmony or discord in these situations.
Evident here is the potential for language textbooks
to bring peace through an analysis of language for
social behaviour.
Aggression and hate are types of behaviour that
prevent the creation of peaceful and sustainable
societies. Language – the choice of words, structure
of sentences and tone – also plays a role in promoting
such behaviour. Identifying the use of such language
in aggressive and hate speech is a key step towards
changing violent thinking, speech and behaviour.
Language textbook writers can address citizenship
education’s concern with hate speech – for example,
as set out in UNESCO’s Countering Online Hate Speech
(2015) or the Online Hate Prevention resources in
Australia6 – by promoting the knowledge and skills to
not only identify hate speech but produce messages
to counter it.
Attending to the emotive level of words (tone,
connotative and denotative word meanings)
is essential in identifying and transforming the
language of hate into the language of peace.
Textbook exercises can encourage students to do this
and to practise translating the language of violence
into the language of peace. Students’ work with
words and phrases and the examination of these in
diff erent contexts (situations of confl ict, harmony,
care, compassion) can lead also to in-depth work
on language as a means to develop relationships
of harmony. Such work, in eff ect, helps students to
become more aware of that kind of language use and
its power to create peace.
Language production, in terms of creative writing,
is a central element of many language textbooks
and provides another opportunity to explore peace.
Focusing on ideas of peace – and on using the
vocabulary of peace even as the causes of its loss may
be part of the narrative – does lead to transformative
experiences. Novels such as Leo Tolstoy’s War and
Peace, Ian McEwan’s Atonement, Alice Walker’s The
Color Purple, Michael Ondaatje’s The English Patient
or Toni Morrison’s Beloved elicit cathartic responses
from their readers. This is equally true of other literary
forms, such as poetry and drama. Such artistic ‘works
of peace’ help contribute to a peaceful world through
their lyrics, imagery and language devices. And as
students are given exercises to analyze these works
of art, they too engage through language with the
making of peaceful societies.
Language textbooks can make use of discourse analysis
for the promotion of peace. Media discourse exercises
can reveal how language can be used for peace or for
violence. Such an analysis of media will include the
examination of the type of headlines used, the various
news stories included, their diction, structure, use of
fi gurative language, the production of stereotypes,
the biases, assumptions, facts included or omitted to
determine the overarching purpose of the discourse
for peace or non-peace. Such analysis reveals language
use in determining attitudes to diff erent groups of
people and nations. The use of language to marginalize
societies and people has been discussed in section 1.
Activities and exercises on unpacking the production
of marginality and stereotypes, for example, can lead
to a greater understanding of the reasons for confl icts
between people and ways to address these. Discourse
analysis, with its emphasis on higher-order thinking,
listening, reading, comprehending and writing skills, is
a tool for understanding language’s role in producing
as well as preventing violence.
Later in this chapter, the example of a unit on
peace and confl ict illustrates various ways in which
language textbook writers can create a unit on peace.
The activities include listening and responding to
songs about peace. It is hoped that the repetition of
words of peace will encourage students to interact
harmoniously with one another. Recognizing that
peace can break down when there are opposing views,
there is a debating exercise to help students fi nd the
appropriate language to express disagreement with
each other. Also included is a tool for managing
confl ict through dialogue: restorative justice circles.
This is being used with success in many schools as well
as in communities in diff erent countries. (For more
ideas about using language for peace, see also the

3.2.6
Using language for social
justice
Here we begin by considering the relationship
between social justice and ESD and will then explore
how language can be used for social justice. Social
justice – the practising of beliefs and policies – forms
the basis of the work of ESD. The presumed authority
and truth of any approach to curriculum and
instruction in public education is always provisional,
historically situated, contextual and political, rather
than fi xed, stable, universal or neutral. This may be
especially true when making policies for socially just
purposes or intentions, as is the case when crafting
texts that address issues of inequity for students.
Stakeholders must learn to treat representations of
policy and practice as provisional and ever-evolving,
depending on context. They must periodically reexamine
fi ndings and implementation to ensure
policies and practices continue to align to the values
of ESD. Doing so prevents processes of rational policy
decision-making from creating unintended pitfalls
and negative consequences that are common even
when unintended and unpredicted. In other words,
social justice work is mired in a web of constant
surveillance that, while it is social-action and change
oriented, it can also be contentious. It is important to
recognize that any lesson can remain adaptive across
contexts to optimize student success.
Textbook authors are mapping out work for
teachers and learners that situates social justice as
the fulcrum for peace, equity and sustainability. It
is of critical import that such work entails equityoriented
lessons to enhance student effi cacy,
engagement, motivation and achievement. By
recognizing that social justice is part and parcel of
ESD, textbook authors will pay explicit attention
and respect to social, cultural, economic, historical
and environmental issues specifi c but not limited to
matters of race, ethnicity, gender, gender expression,
age, appearance, ability, national origin, language,
spiritual belief, size (height and/or weight), sexual
orientation, social class, economic circumstance,
culture and the treatment of animals (CEE, 2009,
belief 2, paragraph 3).
Textbook authors can provide call-out boxes, notes
and lists that defi ne social justice and provide
designs that are responsive to learners in ways
that are socially just. As demonstrated in Table
1 (overleaf ), textbook authors need to be aware
that responsive teaching for social justice requires
an approach that (at least) brackets professionals’
personal beliefs/ideologies in favour of knowledgebased
and socially just teaching practices that
are known to maximize equity for each student as
well as correlate with increased success (Burns and
Botzakis, 2016). Treated in this light, bracketing is a
professional technique that can expand educators’
knowledge of self and other. As such, textbook
exercises should refl ect this. Textbook authors also
need to be aware that the theory of social justice
(Miller and Kirkland, 2010) comprises three key
elements: refl ection, change and participation.
Language for social justice can be addressed
through myriad categories. Table 1 addresses the
possible topics for teachers and outlines how to
select texts that address them.
Textbook authors are

teachers and learners

LANGUAGE TOPIC EXPLANATION EXAMPLE
Hurtful words/
bullying
Each context has off ensive words
that are derogatory and hurtful.
Select examples of those words,
look at their etymology and unpack
the connotations in order to
understand how they can be unjust.
The ‘N word’ in the US can be
considered off ensive to people
of colour depending on the context
and the speaker.
Pronoun use Each context has diff erent pronouns
used or not used to represent
gender. Not all people identify
with a gender or with the gender
they are perceived to be. Review
the pronouns used in various
contexts and consider how they
position identity.
The pronoun ‘they’ is used in the US as
singular so gender is not presumed.
For instance: ‘They were going to the
bathroom,’ or ‘I don’t know what they
were doing.’ In these cases ‘they’ is
considered fi rst person and not plural.
Gender,
positioning
and norms
Each context has historical and
current norms related to gender,
gender expression, gender roles
and gender identities. Beliefs and
their reinforcement aff ect the
way people ‘see’ and ‘understand’
gender. These beliefs then presume
that people have to dress, behave
and even respond in ways that align
with social mores. These beliefs
create stressors that can aff ect
people’s psycho-social-emotional
well-being.
Understand that gender intersects with
other identities (e.g. culture, language,
age, religion, social class, body type,
accent, height, ability, disability and
national origin) that inform beliefs and,
thereby, actions.
Understand gender as fl exible and be
mindful of how specifi c discourse(s) can
reinforce gender norms. Demonstrate
purposefully how gender is fl uid or
exists on a continuum, shifting over
time and in diff erent contexts.

SOCIAL JUSTICE STEPS
(accounting for refl ection, change and participation –
Miller and Kirkland, 2010)
HOW TO SELECT TEXTS
Create a lesson about ways to manifest language justice,
which asks students to identify loaded and hurtful
language used by them, against them and directed
at others. Ask them to do research on terms (e.g.
with people and in texts), review the etymology and
understand the social, emotional and aff ective impact.
Ask them to consider solutions to reduce, reframe and/or
disrupt the use of those terms.
Generate a list of texts and websites across a
range of genres (poetry, short stories, plays,
novels, young adult novels, music, art, etc.) that
include hurtful and off ensive language and are
intended to minimize someone. Be sure these
texts also address forms of healing, redemption
and change. Some of these texts can be
embedded within a teacher’s culture or they can
be examples from other cultures.
Examples of such books for teenagers include
To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee; Every Day by
David Levithan; The Color Purple by Alice Walker.
These websites have excellent resources:

Create a lesson about ways to manifest pronoun justice,
which asks students to identify pronoun use (or lack of)
in their school, local community and state/country. Ask
them to research the terms (e.g. who is named and who
isn’t, how they diff er by context and gender or lack of ).
Ask them to consider how pronouns can marginalize
some people and work with them to develop strategies
for challenging and changing beliefs (e.g. talking to
teachers about how they want to be named/called),
practices (e.g. posters in classrooms and on school walls,
campaigns in the local community) and policies (e.g.
school codes, health care forms and school letters).
Generate a list of texts and websites across a
range of genres (poetry, short stories, plays,
novels, young adult novels, music, art, etc.) that
take up pronoun use in various cultures.

Create a lesson about ways to manifest gender
justice that asks students to understand how gender
expectations position people to behave and perform in
ways that may counter how they identify themselves.
Ask them to make observations in their school, local and
national/state communities (e.g. fi rst, about themselves
in school – their class, sports teams, academic groups –
then in the media, at home, in diff erent jobs, etc.) about
how gendered expectations can lead to negative social
and emotionally aff ective consequences. Work with
students to develop strategies for changing beliefs (e.g.
talking to teachers and others about how they want to
be named/called), practices (e.g. incorporating texts that
challenge and advance gender expectations) and policies
(e.g., working to develop strategies to help build gender
justice/equity in pay, academic opportunities, treatment
and in the law).
Generate a list of texts and websites across a

Language for advocacy
To create a society that is peaceful and just, students
need to learn how to advocate for this. Much of the
work of enabling the achievement of the goals of
sustainable development requires advocating for
policy and action. As students acquire knowledge,
develop attitudes, values and thinking skills for
sustainability, they need also to be enabled to act
on national and global policy levels.
Specifi cally, they need to learn the skills of
advocacy. The teaching of English provides an
ample platform for this because it aims to develop
students’ communication skills – informing,
persuading, clarifying and narrating. Textbook
writers can facilitate this by ensuring that the usual
topic on argument includes the ‘big sustainable
development purpose’. For the planet’s sake,
students need to learn the art of persuasion to have
others understand that the Earth is threatened and
that people can change the situation. The urgency
of changing hearts and minds for a better world
requires textbook exercises and activities that relate
closely to local and global issues by identifying
authentic and real-world tasks and materials.
In preparing students to use language as a tool
for advocacy, textbook authors should consider
exercises that emphasize the importance of what
they need to advocate for, what to express strong
feelings for, who the target audience is, the local
and international agencies or agents to speak to,
To create a society

need to learn how
to advocate for
this. Much of the
work towards
achieving the goals

development
requires advocating
for policy and action
The work of social justice encourages us to look
closely at the conditions that have structured the
system that reinforces beliefs, practices and policies
and that can then inform the identities of our young
people. As we come to work more intently and
review how injustices in diff erent environments can
lead to hurtful outcomes, ESD can help establish
more fair and equitable schooling and social
and cultural environments. This work must look
at root causes, ways to change the exclusionary
political, economic and aff ective practices and the
subsequent conditions that have created injustice in
the fi rst place. To transform schools and educational
systems, we must peer deeply into the conditions in
which language structures were created and then
interlocked with policies, beliefs and behaviour
related to power, privilege and identity. For genuine
change to occur, we have to shift the conditions that
continue to maintain structural inequities that aff ect
today’s schooling environments and that can infl ict
pain and trauma on our young people. By shifting
conditions, we change outcomes and can create fair
and just contexts.
Box 2
Possible genres to include
in textbooks
• Using diff erent textual genres can help
address the issues of injustice set out in
Table 1. Each context will have examples
of required and selected texts that will
lend themselves to this work. Teachers
can choose from a variety of resources
or even have students create their own
materials.
• You can include poetry, music, art,
comics, tattoos, emojis, text messages,
short stories, plays, books, TV, movies,
podcasts, videos, audio books, etc.
• Select texts that address the areas in

unpack language topics.
the type of language to be used (including tone
and diction). In the example ‘my community’ later
in this chapter, we suggest a language advocacy
activity in which students write to their political
representative, councillor or any authority fi gure
for their area on a sustainability issue they have
identifi ed.
In refl ecting on using language as a tool for
advocacy, we are also mindful of the socio-linguistic
skills that are part of this use. Textbook writers could
include activities that require learners to engage
in dialogue with respect, to listen actively and
accurately and to speak or write with a clear purpose
for public benefi t. Exercises that highlight process
and challenges are also important. A good advocate
will need to understand the process and challenges
of eff ective communication. Textbooks should also
include exercises on developing language skills
that will focus on clarity of thought, expression and
style as well as discourse knowledge (perhaps the
language and procedures of the courtroom).

3.2.8
Developing language as a
tool for identity through
mother-tongue use
As indicated in section 1, there is a growing concern
about the hegemony of English in relation to other
languages, particularly the mother tongues of school
students, given that language and culture are closely
linked. Modi (2010) and Durairajan (2005) highlight
the social stigma associated with speaking the
mother tongue – as well as English that ‘betrays’ an
infl uence of the mother tongue – in schools that use
English as the medium of instruction.
The 2014 report on The Promotion and Use of Local
Languages in Primary Education in Senegal states that
when learning at school takes place in a language
that is diff erent from that spoken at home, there is
a symbolic break for the student ‘between the two
major institutions of socialization, which are the
school and the family’. Skutnabb-Kangas (2002), who
has published widely on linguistic human rights,
has argued that the learning of a new language,
including a lingua franca, ought to be additive rather
than subtractive and, therefore, not done ‘at the cost
of diverse mother tongues’. This recommendation
is particularly relevant in the context of the global
refugee crisis that has given rise to new challenges
for language education, with the student population
becoming more linguistically diverse. As indicated
in the Position Paper of the National Focus Group on
the Teaching of English in India (NCERT, 2006), the
mother tongue can be used as a resource in the
English language classroom instead of being treated
as an ‘interloper’. Practically, this implies orienting
textbooks to promote such multilingual activity.
The National Focus Group paper advocates that, at
the lower primary stage, which is taken to be Classes
1 to 3: ‘English can occur in tandem with the fi rst
language(s) for learning activities designed to create
awareness of the world around the child.’ It suggests
doing away with ‘linguistic purism, whether of
English or of Indian languages’, and moving towards
‘a tolerance of code-switching and code-mixing, if
The language of advocacy can be addressed through:
1. ARGUMENT – the logical and clear presentation
of evidence and justifi cations to support a point
of view.
2. AFFECT – assertiveness on one hand and respect
and open-mindedness on the other.
3. STYLE – linguistic choices that add interest,
emphasize and reinforce key ideas and thus
make an impact on the audience.
In the second example module, ‘peace and confl ict’,
a debating task demonstrates how learners’ attention
can be drawn to these strands of the language of
advocacy. As their awareness of these communicative
skills is raised, not only will learners be able to
play an active part in advocating for sustainable
development and peace, but their sensitivity to
how these techniques may be skilfully adopted to
promote non-violence, justice and respect for our
environment will be heightened.

necessary’. This is in keeping with the idea that multilingualism
should be viewed as ‘one of the most
important goals in education’ (Skutnabb-Kangas,
2002) so students from dominant group populations
have the opportunity to learn other languages well,
and students from indigenous and minority group
populations do not have to face ‘linguistic genocide’.
Sagar and Rehman (2011) recognize linguistic
diversity as ‘vital for the long-term survival of
humanity’ because it involves building bridges across
race, culture and other identities. This is essential for
achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4.7, which
emphasizes the ‘promotion of a culture of peace and
non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation
of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to
sustainable development’.
Specifi c strategies to invite the mother tongue into
the English-language classroom through textbooks
include:
i. Selecting short texts from works of post-modern
and post-colonial fi ction in English that celebrate
borrowing words from other languages. For
example, the novels of Chinua Achebe, Moni
Mohsin, Vikram Seth, Salman Rushdie and
Amitav Ghosh.
ii. Selecting excerpts from texts translated into
English from other languages to encourage an
appreciation for diverse cultures depicted in the
stories. For example, the novels of Gabriel García
Márquez, Elena Ferrante, Yasunari Kawabata,
Aleksandr Pushkin and Ambai and the poems
of Pablo Neruda, Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi, Faiz
Ahmed Faiz and Mahmoud Darwish.
iii. Including vocabulary-related activities that
require students to focus on specifi c words in a
text and asking them: ‘How do you say this in your
home language?’ (Particularly vocabulary related
to the weather, the names of fruits, vegetables
and animals.)
iv. Drawing attention to English words in the
textbook that originate from other languages,
for example, words such as juggernaut,
rendezvous, brouhaha, boondocks, karaoke,
catamaran, etc.
v. Selecting texts that highlight the beauty,
complexity and anxiety associated with
linguistic diversity. For example: Arundhathi
Subramaniam’s poem To the Welsh Critic Who
Doesn’t Find Me Identifi ably Indian and Kamala
Das’s poem An Introduction.

enable learners to make
informed decisions and
take action as responsible
global citizens
Principle 3
In discussing this principle, we look at the following
aspects:
● Developing interpretation and thinking skills.
● Reading ecocritically.
● Clarifying values.
● Developing empathy and taking varying
perspectives, including a future’s perspective.
In Principle 2 we emphasized the importance of
selecting the appropriate content and identifying the
skills to be promoted in language textbooks. We also
need, however, to consider another area of language
– reading. Principle 3 focuses on engagement, not so
much through literacy and reading comprehension
but with literature, which encompasses literacy and
comprehension and extends them in various ways. A
number of language texts recognize the importance
of literature and incorporate this by using extracts
from novels and plays or reproducing whole texts of
poetry and short stories.
Literature, in eff ect, adds another dimension to
language teaching and learning, interpretation and
thinking skills. Equally important, students can learn,
through literature, to identify multiple perspectives
on a subject as well as the perspectives and values
needed for a sustainable world. Moreover, students
can learn to develop empathy – to ‘walk in another’s
shoes’ – a necessary ability if human beings are
to live well with each other, to respect and care
for each other and the planet. Literature can be
used in language textbooks to deepen students’
understanding of their world and, in particular, the
values needed to preserve it.
3.3.1
Developing critical
interpretation and
thinking skills
In looking at Principle 2, we discussed ways in
which critical thinking skills could be developed.
We extend that by looking at skills of interpretation.
Literature, in eff ect, adds another dimension to language teaching and
learning, interpretation and thinking skills. Equally important, students
can learn, through literature, to identify multiple perspectives on a subject
as well as the perspectives and values needed for a sustainable world
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 173
Students need to understand the reasons for varied
and sometimes contrasting interpretations. This will
help them to appreciate divergent views while at the
same time learning to discern the ‘truth’ of a text –
its meaning.
A useful exercise to enable the development of
interpretation and thinking skills is to have students
refl ect on the process of interpretation. This exercise,
perhaps in the form of a fl ow chart, would have
students note the importance of the reader in the
process (their context, their knowledge) as well as
the text itself (its context, form and language, for
example, the use of words at the denotative and
connotative levels, the choice of words, the structure).
Another exercise could ask students to identify what
they did as they interpreted an extract from a literary
text and what led to their specifi c interpretation.
3.3.2
Reading ecocritically
Textbook writers can also help learners attend to the
physical environment even when the material does
not focus directly on environmental issues. Learners
can be taught a particular kind of reading that will
uncover the sustainability frame. Here we see the
value of ecocritical theories and reading. Ecocritical
reading, simply explained, is to interpret literary texts
(prose fi ction, poetry and drama) by focusing on
the environment and humans’ relationship to it and
how such relationships have social and economic
implications. This kind of interpretive work is a way
of infusing ESD and enabling the understanding of
sustainable development issues. This approach is
particularly apt when we consider the point made
by Orr (2004) that all education is environmental
education and that learning spaces, pedagogical
approaches and disciplinary boundaries, as well as
the curriculum, need to be shaped by the attention
to place.
Textbook writers can develop students’ sensitivity to
and appreciation of the environment – foundational
to their learning to respect, conserve and protect
the planet. One way is through activities that
require students to respond critically to extracts
from literature texts that describe the environment,
as well as to photographs of diff erent landscapes.
Specifi cally, students can be asked to examine how
the environment is represented, the characters’
attitudes to these representations and the relation
between the physical environment and the social and
economic context. The aim is to focus the students on
the physical environment in texts so they do not just
see it as a setting or context but as a subject in its own
right. Textbook writers can also enable students to
have a deeper reading of the environment by paying
greater attention to the writer’s use of metaphorical
language, structure and tone in representing it.
Some fi ction, for example, Octavia E. Butler’s science
fi ction novel Parable of the Sower, explores fully the
environmental, social and economic crisis we face
today. Employing a future’s perspective, Butler
helps us ‘see’ very closely a world disintegrating as
it has failed to address sustainability issues such as
climate change. She exposes the inter-relatedness
of the social, economic and environmental aspects
of society. Language textbooks with a sustainability
lens, will, therefore, ensure that the activities and
tasks selected will include exploration of extracts
from novels like this. They could be from the science
fi ction genre but not exclusively so. There many other
literary texts with a sustainability/environmental
focus, such as novels by Margaret Atwood, Barbara
Kingsolver and Leslie Marmon Silko. They will help
students to explore themes in a holistic way so they
are able to recognize the connections between
the social, the economic, the political and the
environmental. In other words, they are taught to see
the ‘big picture’ and they learn to think futuristically.
The following tasks, which focus on an extract from
Flight Behaviour by Barbara Kingsolver, illustrate this
deeper reading of the environment.
Novel extract
Th e tree was intact, not cut or broken by the
wind. What a waste. Aft er maybe centuries
of survival it had simply let go of the
ground, the wide fi st of its root mass ripped
up and resting naked above a clay gash in
the wooded mountainside. Like herself, it
just seemed to have come loose from its
station in life. Aft er so much rain upon rain
this was happening all over the county, she’d
seen it in the paper, massive trees keeling
over in the night to ravage a family’s roofl ine
or fl atten the car in the drive.
(Flight Behaviour, p. 6)
Close textual analysis would include studying the
various contrasts, the dominant image of the tree, the
mountainside and other language and literary devices.
Students could also be asked to locate the broader
context of extreme weather conditions and climate
change and to identify the feelings – and possible
reasons for them – that the passage evokes. Questions
could include: what are the possible reasons for the
extreme weather conditions? How do the characters
respond? What can be done in light of such events?
Other activities could include contrasting literary
descriptions such as the one above with extracts
from science or geography describing a similar
phenomenon. Questions could include: what is gained
in each description? What is lost? What is the writer
making us see, understand and feel? What action
can we take?
Ecocritical reading
interprets literary
texts by focusing
on the environment
and human beings’
relationships with it. In
doing do, it considers
the social and
economic implications
of such relationships

3.3.3
Clarifi cation of values
through literature to make
learners aware of the values
needed to create a just and
sustainable environment
Literature in the language class is an excellent tool
to use for values clarifi cation (as discussed in section
1). The goal of transforming our societies cannot be
attained without attending to values such as respect
for self, others and the environment. Nor can it be
achieved without our having an ethos or ethics of
care (see the Earth Charter). One way to develop this
is by using literature.
By using extracts from literary texts, (prose, poetry and
drama), textbook authors can create exercises that
ask students to identify the values the text affi rms or
questions. Students could then be asked to examine
these in terms of the way they support sustainability.
Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea is a good
text to illustrate this. It is a novel in which the writer
explores an old fi sherman’s respect for non-human life
– the fi sh he is impelled to catch. The struggle between
them reveals the courage, skill and power of both
man and animal. The text provides an opportunity
for students to identify the values revealed in the
continuing narrative of human beings’ ambivalent
relationship with their environment. Questions and
activities can centre on humans’ confl icting drives –
to acknowledge the right of the non-human and the
environment to exist while needing to extract from the
environment in order to live.
Ceremony, a contemporary novel by Leslie Marmon
Silko, also focuses on this issue. In this book, the
writer uncovers a traditional people’s deep respect
for the land and contrasts it with modern land use
and abuse.
Another suitable text is Diana McCaulay’s novel
for adolescents, Gone to Drift, in which the author
focuses on a boy’s search for his grandfather, a
fi sherman whose courage and determination to
save the fi sh places him in grave danger. (McCaulay’s
exploration of the tensions and confl icts experienced
by poor fi sher-folk as they face a dwindling supply
also deepens the narrative of the documentary Massa
God Fish Can Done, mentioned under Principle 2).
(The three novels named above are simply examples
of texts that emphasize the relationship between
human beings and the environment. There are many
other literary works on this theme to choose from,
including those by the authors already mentioned in
this chapter – such as Margaret Atwood and Barbara
Kingsolver – and a host of others).
The appropriate literature exercises can lead
students to identify values that support a
sustainable society. An exercise in which students
list the values displayed in the text and then
comment on and reference them would be useful
for a values-clarifi cation exercise. Students could
also work on language use. They could be asked
to identify negative as well as positive emotional
language (such as ridiculing or praising) used
by diff erent characters and note the eff ect it has
on the characters’ relationships with each other.
Table 2 illustrates this.
Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 175
3.3.4
Using literature to develop
empathy and the ability to
see varying perspectives,
including a future’s
perspective
Equally important is the use of literature for
developing empathy – helping students to see the
world from the perspective of other people and to
experience how others feel. Literature provides many
diff erent experiences for our students as well as
providing opportunities for exploring many diff erent
perspectives. By reading literature, students can
become immersed in the lives of others, experience
their pain and joy and view subjects from diff erent
points of view. Literature becomes a means of
building connectivity between people and animals.
For example, in the 1995 US fi lm Powder, the
eponymous hero impels a hunter to rethink his
wanton killing of animals. Acting as a conduit,
Powder makes the hunter experience viscerally the
death pangs of the beautiful deer he has shot for
sport. A good literary text will also make that kind of
impact on its readers. By using literature, textbook
writers can create exercises that help students
connect deeply with life. One way to do this is to
have the students compare the text in the class
with a similar real-world text. An example of this is
provided in the ‘Literature to Address Violence’ case
study in the UNESCO publication Guidelines and
Recommendations for Reorienting Teacher Education
to Address Sustainability (2005).7
Additionally, textbook writers can provide activities
that help students to refl ect on their feelings for
diff erent characters and situations, identify diff erent
worldviews and perspectives (as presented in the
literature extract or text) and then discuss these
in comparison with a sustainable development
worldview.
Having a future’s perspective or future-casting is a way
of imagining what existing trends, attitudes and values
could become. Useful language-textbook activities
to explore future-casting could include students
writing and exploring alternative futures and reading
literature, such as the science fi ction texts mentioned
earlier, to analyze the possible futures presented.

Box 3
Th e ‘what if?’ activity
• What if world leaders fail to honour
climate action agreements?
• What would a newspaper produced
50 years from now look like if
we honoured the climate action
agreements? Consider its lead stories,
commentaries, entertainment
and comic sections.
Values clarifi cation needs to be linked to cultural
context. Diverse communities do not all share
the same values. Since textbook writers are often
writing for diverse groups, some attention has to be
paid to diff erent value systems. One useful way of
addressing this is by having students examine the
Earth Charter, which sets out a common set of values
for the planet.
Activities based on dialogues can help students
identify and clarify values. A close reading of
dialogues in literature texts would provide a space
for this. In addition, students could be asked to
analyze or create sets of dialogues to explore values.
Students could also be asked to engage in dialogue
on a subject or with individuals who have diff ering
opinions (after having been given appropriate
guidelines). In this way, they are engaging in concrete
transformative activities in the classroom.
Noddings (2002, p. 17) indicates how this may be
done, advocating a dialogue in which participants
take turns as carer and cared-for and reach across
ideological gaps to connect with each other.
Noddings (2002, p. 18) also cites the Common Ground
Organization as illustrating how to put aside the ‘war
model of dialogue’. She describes an organization in
which women on opposite sides of the abortion issue
engage in ‘true’ dialogue. Their goal is not to persuade
opponents to agree with them but ‘to maintain
caring relations across diff erence’ so communication,
compassion and empathy are nurtured. The violence
and name-calling are being addressed in practical
ways. The women, furthermore, have found common
ground where they can achieve common goals, for
example, by providing help to children in need. Most
important, they model a way to live constructively
with diff erences. Translating that into a textbook
lesson would go a long way in developing the
peaceful societies we wish for. An exercise requiring
students to identify contrasting and competing
values, followed by a search for common goals and
common ground, would, therefore, be valuable.
Literature provides
many diff erent
experiences for
our students as
well as providing
opportunities for
exploring many
diff erent perspectives.
By reading literature,
students can become
immersed in the lives of
others, experience their
pain and joy and view
subjects from diff erent
points of view

Example of a language textbook exercise
with ESD embedded
My community
In this textbook example for primary school pupils, we
look at the topic ‘my community’. The aim is to help
students see what is happening in their community
from a sustainable development perspective.
They are, therefore, expected to identify aspects
of the community that help to make it sustainable
and aspects that do not. At a fundamental level,
the learners will learn to appreciate and care for

Student-centred as well as community-centred
learning approaches are also encouraged. In this
regard, project-based learning, participative,
experimental and refl exive-based approaches
are part of the toolkit for student-centred and
community-centred pedagogy. In considering
this, language textbook authors can ensure that
the activities they write refl ect this pedagogy. The
Sandwatch programme, which is used by many
schools around the world, provides another example
of a community-centred and student-centred
learning approach. In this programme, students are
invited to monitor a beach or waterway for a period –
noting such things as water quality, debris and beach
erosion – and then analyze the results. The students
then share their results and take action. Following
this pattern, language activities could invite students
to monitor an area to observe what happens there
in terms of people’s language interaction. They will
then analyze it (for example, its content, type, the
values refl ected), share their fi ndings (using diff erent
types of writing/media) and take action. This could
include writing a newspaper article, preparing a
poster that would help develop citizens’ awareness of
their language use and the values that are refl ected.
Of course, the Sandwatch programme could also be
used as it stands to provide an opportunity to develop
An ESD pedagogy emphasizes an action-oriented teaching and learning approach. Students are engaged in
authentic tasks with their local and global community in mind. Language teaching is a way to bring attention
to an issue and to produce change. Therefore, it is important to include some form of community action as an
activity. This is seen in the following example of the unit ‘my community’. In the second example, which looks
at a unit on peace and confl ict, the students engage in real-world action through a restorative justice circle.
This gives them the opportunity to resolve their issues (perhaps confl ict with other students) in a peaceful way.

The fi rst set of tasks or activities aims to help students see what is happening in their community from a
ESD perspective, to learn to appreciate and care for a place and to think refl ectively and critically about their
communities. These tasks require the children to listen to songs about communities, for example, Penny Lane 8
by the Beatles and a Jamaican folk song Linstead Market; read refl ective pieces on an interesting place in their
community; visit local places of interest and watch video clips on zoos and game reserves.
The songs selected refl ect a love of community – a necessary attribute for learners if they are to develop as
citizens who are aware of sustainable development practices.
An example of specifi c tasks learners would be required to carry out in connection with Penny Lane:
● Identify what is special to the singers about Penny Lane.
● Identify two or three lines with which you agree or which puzzle you. Explain why.
● Compose a response to the song.
● Choose a song (folk, pop, hip-hop, rap, etc.) that refl ects your point of view on places special to you.
Th is second task uses a folk song from a region, which is intended to engender feelings of aff ection for a
place. Th is Jamaican folk song can easily be substituted for one pertinent to another region.

Listening to songs or a poem about communities
The specific language skills focus on writing – to
describe accurately and with a purpose, to reflect
and inform, to identify and clarify.
This is an example of a textbook module that can
be used to help primary-level learners develop an
appreciation for their local community, engage with
sustainability issues and participate in the creation of
sustainable societies through learning English. The
module aims to develop a sensitivity towards what
it means to be a good citizen at the local as well as
global level.
The objectives for English learning in this unit
are broad based as well as specifi c. They include
developing particular attitudes and values, such as
learning to communicate with clarity and respect.
They are also specifi c linguistic aspects because
the unit seeks to address accurate standard English
usage, for example, the correct use of tenses.

Learners could be asked to:
● Discuss what happens at Linstead Market.
Identify reasons why the singer is urging her
listeners to go to Linstead Market, note what
she expects to do there and why her hopes are
dashed. Learners could also be asked to think
about the eff ect of the singer’s experience. What
does she expect to do there? Why are her hopes
dashed? What do you think will be the eff ect of
her experience there?
● Discuss the language used – its similarities and
diff erences from standard English.
(Students could also be asked to explore poems
about home, for example, Madras10 by Arundhathi
Subramaniam.)
Students could be asked to:
● Identify places in their community where they feel a sense of peace.
● Visit some of these places and interview individuals they meet there.
● Read what a writer says about a place that is special to them.
● Write about a place that is special to them.
Th e Pool of Nectar
by Chintan Modi
Harmandir Sahib, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, is a place like no other I have experienced before.
It does something to me. Th ough it is always fi lled with hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of people,
somehow, I feel like I am the only one around.
Th ere is something magical about taking off my clothes and entering that sacred pool to stand neckdeep
in water, face the shrine, and soak in that meditative moment made special by the devotional
music that fi lls the air.
Th at primordial sense of surrender to the elements is both refreshing and humbling. In that moment,
there is no baggage to be held, there are no fears to be exorcised, there is no work routine to get back
to. It is just me, in my skin, feeling grateful for the miracle of being brought there. May all beings
experience this gift of peace. (Modi 2015)

EXAMPLE
My community
A zoo is selected for this example but it could easily be substituted for other places of interest. It capitalizes on
the learners’ interest in animals to build their appreciation of place and animals. This exercise can also be used
to explore the value of care and respect for the environment. The zoo is both a ‘disturbing’ as well as a ‘positive’
place. Learners are invited to think critically about their environment – and what they would like to change
about it.
First they are invited to read a refl ective piece on a child’s visit to the zoo; then they are asked to respond by
completing the following tasks.
A VISIT TO THE ZOO IN MY COMMUNITY
I love visiting the zoo. You really get to see up close many diff erent types of animals, birds and reptiles.
I also feel sad sometimes when I visit the zoo because the animals are locked away in cages. Th e muchfeared
lion, behind bars, seems to have sad eyes in its huge head. Th is is so diff erent from movies I’ve
seen of lions in the wild. Th ere they appear to be strong and majestic. I wonder if it is right to have such
a creature locked into such a small space, such a cage. I know, though, that there are zoos where big
animals such as lions, elephants and hippopotamus are able to roam for miles.
● LIST QUESTIONS you may have about the way people treat animals.
● CREATE A POSTER on how we should care for animals.
● WATCH A CLIP from the fi lm Happy Feet and share your views.
● THINK ABOUT what you would like to change about zoos.

ESD pedagogy also includes an action-oriented approach and this exercise is one that enables learners to engage
in community action. The learners are also using language as a tool for clarifying values and for advocacy. The
specifi c language skills involve writing – to describe accurately and with a purpose, to refl ect and to inform, and
to identify and to clarify.
EXAMPLE TASKS
● MAPPING their community. Learners are asked to draw a map on which they identify main streets
and interesting places. Th ey highlight positive places in their community (ones that bring joy and
comfort) as well as troubling places that they would like to change.
● WRITING to their local councillor or leader advocating for change.
Th e learners could then be given guidelines for writing a letter of advocacy. Th ey would be guided in
terms of the content, that is, the language used (tone and diction) and how to communicate coherently
with respect and clarity.
Suggested guidelines for writing a letter of advocacy could include asking learners to:
i. MAKE a list of the problems in their community. For example, these could relate to issues of health
(no piped water, too many mosquito-breeding grounds, garbage not collected on a regular basis) or
violence (poor lighting, no security cameras, too many people with guns, too few police patrols).
ii. DECIDE who they will write to, for example, the councillor or leader for the area.
iii. PLAN what they will write. Make an outline.
iv. EXPLAIN clearly the problem and its impact on the community’s well-being.
v. ACKNOWLEDGE what has been done already with regard to the problem. Request what they would
like done. Indicate what they will contribute to solving the problem.
vi. BE RESPECTFUL. Try to see the problem from other people’s perspectives.

Example of a language textbook exercise
with ESD embedded
Peace and confl ict
This example textbook module targets junior highschool
students and explores the theme of peace at
an individual, national and global level. It makes use
of the ‘open content space’ of language teaching to
address complicated topics such as the value of war,
national identity and confl ict resolution. A variety of
language tasks that use authentic fi ctional and nonfi
ctional texts are included to help students develop
the communicative competencies that allow
them to analyze texts critically and systematically,
empathise, refl ect, advocate and act on their values.
A range of language teaching points is covered:
1. For grammar – active and passive voices.
2. For vocabulary – gender-biased expressions.
3. For literary devices – fi gures of speech such as puns.
4. Rhetorical strategies.
Rather than including these language teaching
points in a standalone, non-communicative manner,
they are blended into this thematic module with a
strong ESD focus, making it a great example of how
the ‘open content space’ allows language and ESD
teaching objectives to be achieved simultaneously.
In the fi rst sample activity, students are asked to
compare two songs about peace and war. Publishers
could make use of any authentic songs, preferably
based on or in response to historical events, to help

and confl ict
Listen to the two songs below. Read the lyrics and answer the questions.
Song 1: Buff alo Soldier by Bob Marley11
1. Why do you think the buff alo soldier was ‘fi ghting on arrival’ and ‘fi ghting for survival’? How do you
think he felt about this?
2. Th e phrase ‘where you’re coming from’ is used as a pun, i.e. an expression with multiple meanings.
What could this phrase refer to here?
3. If you were a buff alo soldier, who would you consider yourself to be or where would you belong?
4. Are the verbs (the words ‘win’, ‘fi ghting’, ‘driven’) in the active or passive voice? What do the diff erences
in voices help to emphasize? By using the passive voice, what information is the songwriter able to
withold from the audience?
Song 2: Imagine by John Lennon12
5. What reasons for killing and death are mentioned? Do you agree it is more likely for people to live in
peace when these things do not exist?
6. Compare the two lines (‘It isn’t hard to do’ and ‘I wonder if you can?’). To the songwriter, what is more
diffi cult to imagine: no possessions or no countries? Why?

students see the relevance of the texts to their world.
Authentic literary texts also often encourage further
individual investigation of the historical context of the
songs.
In this example, students are guided to empathize
with the protagonist (Song 1) or the songwriter (Song
2), allowing them to understand a topic from other
people’s perspectives, develop the capacity to feel
for other people and see how human experiences are
connected.
Questions 1, 3 and 5 are follow-up tasks that ask
students to select lines that resonate with or confuse
them and rewrite lyrics of another song to show their
feelings. These provide opportunities to respond to
the empathy felt in the previous task.
Students’ attention can also be easily drawn to the
use of language to promote peace and justice in the
selected texts. The given example discusses how
grammatical structures, such as active and passive
voices, are used to highlight or hide the agent of an
action (question 4). For vocabulary, awareness of
gender-normed phrases, such as ‘brotherhood’ in
question 7, is raised. Literary devices such as puns that
require inferential reading (question 2) are introduced.
7. What do you think the ‘brotherhood of man’ refers to? Why do you think John Lennon did not write
‘sisterhood of women’ instead? Do you agree with his choice of words?
1. COMPARE and contrast the two songs in terms of:
- Th e content.
- Th e perspectives of the songwriters.
- Th e language.
2. IDENTIFY two or three lines that resonate with or puzzle you. Explain why.
3. CHOOSE a song (pop, hip-hop, rap, etc.) and rewrite the lyrics so that they refl ect your point of
view on peace.
Th e second sample activity is a debate on a topic entitled ‘Is war ever justifi ed?’ Debate is a popular
language teaching activity because it requires students to consider diff erent points of view carefully
and to analyze their validity objectively. Students build arguments, identify and evaluate reasons and
gather evidence to support their arguments, as well as refute opposing points of view. In the example
below, guidance on argument is provided specifi cally in steps 1 and 2. Training like this promotes critical
thinking skills and reinforces logic in persuasion.
Another learning focus for the debate could be peaceful and non-confrontational communication.
(Specifi c strategies that language teachers can use are discussed by Modi in ‘Responding to confl ict’
in Teacher Plus (2014a).13) Guidance can be given on verbal and non-verbal communication skills
for showing disagreement respectfully. Our example below highlights language features that promote
peaceful and rational communication, such as hedging and modality, and delivery skills that show
assertiveness but non-aggression (steps 3 and 4). An example of how two professors hold a peaceful
debate on a similar topic is shown to students (step 6).
Student-centredness is, naturally, another feature of a debating activity. To enhance this further, the
outcome of the debate can be left to students to judge, as in this example.
Th is passes the authority to assess and evaluate from the teacher to the students, giving them a stronger
sense of owning their learning.

ACTIVITY 2
Debating the topic ‘Is war ever justifi ed?’
Some people believe wars can be justifi ed, if certain conditions are met. Others believe that the damage
caused by war outweighs any benefi ts it can bring in all circumstances. Th e ‘just war theory’ is debated
widely by philosophers, theologians of diff erent religions, military leaders and policy-makers alike.
You will participate in a debate on: ‘Is war ever justifi ed?’
1. In your group, brainstorm reasons why war can possibly be justifi ed and why it can never be. You can
use the table below to help your organize your ideas.
War can be justifi ed War can never be justifi ed
because… /if… because…
2. Your group will debate the topic against another group. You will draw lots to decide which group will
debate ‘affi rmative’ and which group ‘negative’.
To prepare for the debate, fi rst you should get the content ready. Revisit the table, select the most
plausible points and make a list of the arguments you can use in the debate. Pay attention to whether
these arguments are logical and if there is any overlap between them. Rewrite accordingly. Th ese
carefully revised arguments will form the framework for your debate.

Textbooks for sustainable development – a guide to embedding | 183
A list of arguments, however logical and valid, will not convince many people unless it is supported
by evidence. Next, therefore, you should conduct research and fi nd relevant examples, data and facts.
Very oft en, it is the quality of the supporting evidence, rather than the validity of the arguments
themselves, that make or break your debate.
Lastly, you should also organize and sequence your arguments and, when appropriate, highlight
connections between ideas using signpost phrases to make your points easy for your audience
to follow.
3. Based on the points you have brainstormed in step 1, speculate the arguments your opponent group
will present and prepare your rebuttal (i.e. why the opponent’s ideas are not valid or signifi cant).
When you rebut a point, you should fi rst summarize the opponent’s argument and then focus on
showing the fallacy in their argument. Even when you are disagreeing with the other group, you
should still remain respectful. Making personal attacks or rude criticisms would only undermine your
rationality and weaken your stance. To show respect and remain polite as you disagree, you may fi nd
the following expressions helpful:
Th at may be so, but …
Th at might have been the case once, but …
Well, maybe they do, but …
… may be right about … but …
Possibly … But the problem is …
Th at would be great, except that …
Th at point of view seems to be logically irreconcilable.
While that could be true in some parts of the world …
Although …, … doesn’t necessarily follow.
Th at appears to be true in some parts of the world but in a lot of countries …
Did you notice what the bold words share in common? Do they show certainty or tentativeness? Why
are they eff ective for showing disagreement politely?
4. Present your arguments. You should pay attention not only to the content of your arguments but also
how you deliver them or, in other words, your non-verbal delivery. Th ink about how you may look
and sound when you are fi rm and assertive, rather than aggressive and provocative.
● Eye contact.
● Body language.
● Facial expressions.
● Voice.
5. Aft er you fi nish your debate, discuss in your group:
● Which group should win the debate.
● Which of your opponent group’s arguments was the most convincing.
● Which member of your opponent group performed the best.
Remember to give reasons to support your choice. You can write a note or a text to show them your
appreciation. Th e more specifi c your comments, the better.
Example: ‘When you presented the argument about …, the statistics you used were very persuasive.
You must have done a lot of research into the topic. Well done!’
6. Professor Bryan Caplan and Professor Jan Ting once debated this topic on a television programme.

respectful, verbally and non-verbally, even when they disagree with each other.

Th e third sample activity shows a practical and concrete way to teach students how to address confl icts,
how to resolve their issues through dialogue, and how to build a trusting and caring community. (See
Cliff ord’s Teaching Restorative Practices with Classroom Circles.14) Note that restorative practice is also an
alternative form of discipline to punishment.
Th e example below enables students to develop empathy but, this time, rather than empathizing with
characters in a literary text, they will learn to communicate in order to feel for each other. Active listening
can be promoted and with the clarifi cation time built in, questions can be asked to help clear up any
misunderstanding.
Using students’ confl icts as topics of discussion, although potentially sensitive, gives the task authenticity
and relevance when guided strategically by the steps and monitored by the teacher. When students
themselves are the focus of a task, which is not always common in a classroom, they are likely to be a lot
more engaged and motivated.
ACTIVITY 3
Restorative practice in the classroom
Instructions on how to conduct restorative practice:
1. Th e teacher and the students sit in a circle.
2. Th e teacher explains the purpose of the activity (to address a particular issue or harmful behaviour, to
build trust, to make things right) and the process.
3. Th e teacher and students agree on the rules for the circle – individuals listen to each other and speak
only when they have been given ‘the fl oor’. Participants use a ‘talking piece’, any object that the group
deems appropriate, as a way of determining who is speaking. Participants speak only when they have
the talking piece. Th e talking piece may be placed in the centre of the circle and picked up by anyone
in the group who would like to speak. Once an individual has the talking piece, others in the group
are to listen. Th e group also decides on the level of sharing and confi dentiality.
4. Th e teacher uses prompt questions – to raise and clarify an issue, to encourage a respectful response.
Keeps it real. Actively listens. Refrains from correcting and fi xing. Uses and encourages use of the
talking piece.
Th e teacher ends circle time and invites brief feedback from students. Th e teacher ends with a ritual, a
practice that will become part of the classroom’s routine.

APPENDIX 2
The Queer Literacy Framework (Miller, 2016), which is addressed to educators, may prove useful to textbook writers as they work to achieve an
inclusive approach. Queer means a disrupting of binaries and a suspension of rigid categorizations of identity.
Principles Commitments of educators who use queer literacy
1. Refrains from possible presumptions that students are
heterosexual or ascribe to a gender.
Educators who use queer literacy never presume that students are a
particular sexual orientation or a gender.
2. Understands gender as a construct which has and
continues to be impacted by intersecting factors
(e.g. social, historical, material, cultural, economic,
religious).
Educators who employ queer literacy are committed to classroom
activities that actively push back against gender constructs and
provide opportunities to explore, engage and understand how gender
is constructed.
3. Recognizes that masculinity and femininity constructs
are assigned to gender norms and are situationally
performed.
Educators who engage with queer literacy challenge gender norms and
gender stereotypes and actively support students’ various and multiple
performances of gender.
4. Understands gender and sexuality as fl exible. Educators who engage with queer literacy are mindful about how
specifi c discourse(s) can reinforce gender and sexuality norms, and
they purposefully demonstrate how gender and sexuality are fl uid or
exist on a continuum, shift ing over time and in diff erent contexts.
5. Opens up spaces for students to self-defi ne with
chosen (a)genders, (a)sexuality, (a)pronouns or names.
Educators who engage with queer literacy invite students to self-defi ne
and/or reject a chosen or preferred gender, sexual orientation, name
and/or pronoun.
6. Engages in ongoing critique of how gender norms are
reinforced in literature, media, technology, art, history,
science, maths, etc.
Educators who use queer literacy provide ongoing and deep
discussions about how society is gendered and primarily heterosexual,
and thus invite students to actively engage in analysis of cultural texts
and disciplinary discourses.
7. Understands how Neoliberal principles reinforce
and sustain compulsory heterosexism, which secures
homophobia; how gendering secures bullying and
transphobia; and how homonormativity placates a
heterosexual political economy.
Educators who employ queer literacy understand and investigate
structural oppression and how heterosexism sustains (a)gendered
violence, and generate meaningful opportunities for students to
become embodied change agents and to be proactive against, or to not
engage in, bullying behaviour.
8. Understands that (a)gender and (a)sexuality intersect
with other identities (e.g. culture, language, age,
religion, social class, body type, accent, height, ability,
disability and national origin) that inform students’
beliefs and, thereby, actions.
Educators who engage with queer literacy do not essentialize students’
identities but recognize how intersections of culture, language, age,
religion, social class, body type, accent, height, ability, disability and
national origin inform students’ beliefs and, thereby, actions.
9. Advocates for equity across all categories of
(a)gender and (a)sexuality orientations.
Educators who employ queer literacy do not privilege one belief or
stance but advocate for equity across all categories of (a)gender and
(a)sexuality orientations.
10. Believes that students who identify on a continuum of
gender and sexual minorities (GSM) deserve to learn
in environments free of bullying and harassment.
Educators who use queer literacy make their positions known, when
fi rst hired, to students, teachers, administrators and school personnel
and take a stance when any student is bullied or marginalized, whether
explicitly or implicitly, for (a)gender or (a)sexuality orientation.
‘This guidebook will be an eye-opener for many stakeholders
in curriculum and textbook development’
Eckhardt Fuchs
Director, Georg Eckert Institute for International Textbook Research
The interconnected environmental, economic, social and political challenges facing humanity call for education that enables
young people to engage creatively and responsibly with the world. More than ever, the quality of education is determined by
whether students have access to content and pedagogy designed to help them learn to live together on a planet under pressure.
In other words, education for sustainable development and global citizenship needs to become a core guiding principle of
educational change. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal Target 4.7 offers the international consensus and
momentum to achieve this.
Our proposal is to begin by taking the concrete step of transforming textbooks – the teaching and learning resources that are
most prevalent around the world and the ones closest to students. This book offers concrete guidance for authors of mathematics,
science, language and geography textbooks on how to ‘embed’ peace, sustainable development and global citizenship in
textbook content. Embedding is not about inserting new thematic content into an already overcrowded curriculum. Instead, it
is about reorienting core subjects to serve a purpose that is more socially and globally relevant, empowering young people to
address local and global challenges with a shared respect for human dignity.
