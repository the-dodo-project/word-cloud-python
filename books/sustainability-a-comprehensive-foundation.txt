Foreword1
Sustainability is derived from two Latin words: sus which means up and tenere which means to hold. In
its modern form it is a concept born out of the desire of humanity to continue to exist on planet Earth
for a very long time, perhaps the indenite future. Sustainability is, hence, essentially and almost literally
about holding up human existence. Possibly, the most succinct articulation of the issue can be found in
the Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. The report entitled Our Common
Future2
 primarily addressed the closely related issue of Sustainable Development. The report, commonly
know as the Brundtland Report after the Commission Chair Gro Harlem Brundtland, stated that Humanity
has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Following the concept of Sustainable
Development, the commission went on to add  Yet in the end, sustainable development is not a xed state of
harmony, but rather a process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments,
the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are made consistent with future as
well as present needs. We do not pretend that the process is easy or straightforward. Painful choices have to
be made. Thus, in the nal analysis, sustainable development must rest on political will. Sustainability and
the closely related concept of Sustainable Development are, therefore, very human constructs whose objective
is to insure the very survival of humanity in a reasonably civilized mode of existence. Here, however, I will
focus primarily on Sustainability.
The seriousness of the issue of Sustainability has become increasingly important and obvious over the last
fty years driven by an increasing human population with increasing per capita resource consumption on a
planet which is after all nite. Note that the World population3
increased from approximately 2.5 billion in
1950 to about 7.0 billion in 2012. Furthermore, total World consumption expenditures4
rose from about 171
Billion in 1960 to approximately 44,000 billions in 2010 expressed in 2012 U.S. dollars. This is not to say
that consumption is necessarily bad, but rather that there are so many people consuming so many resources
that both the World environment and human consumption will have to be managed with far more care and
delicacy than has been necessary in all of the historical past.
A text such as the one being presented here is of paramount importance because it will help to educate
the next generation of students on the very important subject of sustainability. Now sustainability is not
exactly a discipline such as, for example, physics. Rather it is truly a metadiscipline drawing on nearly all of
existing human knowledge in approximately equal parts and with more or less equal importance. This is not
to say that dierent disciplines have not in the past drawn ideas from each other, creating hybrid disciplines
such as, for instance, biophysics - a fusion of physics and biology. Rather, in Sustainability the range of
ideas and issues reach from the depth of biological sciences to the physical sciences and to the social sciences,
including politics. Additionally, the relative importance of each of these aspects seems to be about the same.
The reasons for this inherent, perhaps unprecedented complexity, is that sustainability is about sustaining
human existence which requires many things to be sustained including functioning economic, social, and
political systems along with a supportive physical and biological environment and more.
Hence, the eort to produce a text covering the breadth of sustainability must by necessity come from
a comprehensive group of specialists as is the case here. This allows each eld of study to bring its own
unique perspective and shed its own light on a very complex and important subject which could otherwise

be intractable. The authors very interestingly point out in the preface that the text does not necessarily
present a self-consistent set of ideas. Rather, a degree of diversity is accepted within the overall rubric of
Sustainability and Science itself. This may be unusual for an academic text, but it is necessary here. The
reason is that environmental problems of our time are both time-sensitive and evolving, and a complete
understanding does not exist and may never exist. But the issues still have to be addressed in good faith,
in a timely manner, with the best science on hand. With the reader's indulgence, I would like to draw an
analogy to a physician who has the responsibility of healing or attempting to heal patients using the best
available medical science in a timely manner, knowing that a complete understanding of medical science does
not exist and, in fact, may never exist.
It is my sincerest hope this work shared freely and widely will be an educational milestone as humanity
struggles to understand and solve the enormous environmental challenges of our time. Further, the text
Sustainability: A comprehensive Foundation, helps to provide the intellectual foundation that will allow
students to become the engines that move and maintain society on the path of Sustainability and Sustainable
Development through the dicult process of change alluded to in Our Common Future.

Preface5
This text is designed to introduce the reader to the essential concepts of sustainability. This subject is of
vital importance  seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of
the planet  but is only peripherally served by existing college textbooks.
The content is intended to be useful for both a broad-based introductory class on sustainability and
as a useful supplement to specialist courses which wish to review the sustainability dimensions of their
areas of study. By covering a wide range of topics with a uniformity of style, and by including glossaries,
review questions, case studies, and links to further resources, the text has sucient range to perform as
the core resource for a semester course. Students who cover the material in the book will be conversant in
the language and concepts of sustainability, and will be equipped for further study in sustainable planning,
policy, economics, climate, ecology, infrastructure, and more.
Furthermore, the modular design allows individual chapters and sections to be easily appropriated 
without the purchase of a whole new text. This allows educators to easily bring sustainability concepts,
references, and case studies into their area of study.
This appropriation works particularly well as the text is free  downloadable to anyone who wishes to use
it. Furthermore, readers are encouraged to work with the text. Provided there is attribution to the source,
users can adapt, add to, revise and republish the text to meet their own needs.
Because sustainability is a cross-disciplinary eld of study, producing this text has required the bringing
together over twenty experts from a variety of elds. This enables us to cover all of the foundational components of sustainability: understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of
sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires
technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).
Readers accustomed to textbooks that present material in a unitary voice might be surprised to nd
in this one statements that do not always agree. Here, for example, cautious claims about climate change
stand beside sweeping pronouncements predicting future social upheaval engendered by a warming world.
And a chapter that includes market-based solutions to environmental problems coexists with others that
call for increased government control. Such diversity of thought characterizes many of the elds of inquiry
represented in the book; by including it, we invite users to engage in the sort of critical thinking a serious
study of sustainability requires.
It is our sincerest hope that this work is shared freely and widely, as we all struggle to understand and
solve the enormous environmental challenges of our time.

Introduction to Sustainability:
Humanity and the Environment
1.1 An Introduction to Sustainability: Humanity and the
Environment1
1.1.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this chapter, students should be able to
• learn the meaning of sustainability in its modern context
• acquire a basic facility for using the IPAT equation
• learn about patterns of human consumption
• understand the major factors that contribute to unsustainable impacts
1.2 What is Sustainability?2
In 1983 the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 38/161 entitled Process of Preparation of
the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond3
, establishing a special commission whose
charge was:
(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000
and beyond;
(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation
among developing countries and between countries at dierent stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account
of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment and development;
(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more eectively with
environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;
(d) To help to dene shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate eorts
needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term
agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking
into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in
1982.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO SUSTAINABILITY: HUMANITY AND
THE ENVIRONMENT
The commission later adopted the formal name World Commission on Environment and Development
(WCED) but became widely known by the name of its chair Gro Harlem Brundtland4
, a medical doctor
and public health advocate who had served as Norway's Minister for Environmental Aairs and subsequently
held the post of Prime Minister during three periods. The commission had twenty-one members5 drawn from
across the globe, half representing developing nations. In addition to its fact-nding activities on the state
of the global environment, the commission held fteen meetings in various cities around the world seeking
rsthand experiences on the how humans interact with the environment. The Brundtland Commission issued
its nal report Our Common Future6
 in 1987.
Although the Brundtland Report did not technically invent the term sustainability, it was the rst
credible and widely-disseminated study that probed its meaning in the context of the global impacts of
humans on the environment. Its main and often quoted denition refers to sustainable development as
. . .development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations
to meet their own needs. The report uses the terms sustainable development, sustainable, and sustainability interchangeably, emphasizing the connections among social equity, economic productivity, and
environmental quality. The pathways for integration of these may dier nation by nation; still these pathways must share certain common traits: the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority
should be given, and the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on
the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.
Thus there are three dimensions that sustainability seeks to integrate: economic, environmental, and
social (including sociopolitical). Economic interests dene the framework for making decisions, the ow of
nancial capital, and the facilitation of commerce, including the knowledge, skills, competences and other
attributes embodied in individuals that are relevant to economic activity. Environmental aspects recognize
the diversity and interdependence within living systems, the goods and services produced by the world's
ecosystems, and the impacts of human wastes. Socio-political refers to interactions between institutions/rms
and people, functions expressive of human values, aspirations and well-being, ethical issues, and decisionmaking that depends upon collective action. The report sees these three elements as part of a highly
integrated and cohesively interacting, if perhaps poorly understood, system.
The Brundtland Report makes it clear that while sustainable development is enabled by technological
advances and economic viability, it is rst and foremost a social construct that seeks to improve the quality
of life for the world's peoples: physically, through the equitable supply of human and ecological goods and
services; aspirationally, through making available the widespread means for advancement through access
to education, systems of justice, and healthcare; and strategically, through safeguarding the interests of
generations to come. In this sense sustainability sits among a series of human social movements that have
occurred throughout history: human rights, racial equality, gender equity, labor relations, and conservation,
to name a few.

The intersection of social and economic elements can form the basis of social equity. In the sense
of enlightened management, "viability" is formed through consideration of economic and environmental
interests. Between environment and social elements lies bearability, the recognition that the functioning of
societies is dependent on environmental resources and services. At the intersection of all three of these lies
sustainability.
The US Environmental Protection Agency8
(US EPA) takes the extra step of drawing a distinction
between sustainability and sustainable development, the former encompassing ideas, aspirations and values
that inspire public and private organizations to become better stewards of the environment and that promote
positive economic growth and social objectives, the latter implying that environmental protection does not
preclude economic development and that economic development must be ecologically viable now and in the
long run.
The Chapter The Evolution of Environmental Policy in the United States (Section 2.1) presents
information on how the three components that comprise sustainability have inuenced the evolution of
environmental public policy. The Chapter Sustainability: Ethics, Culture, and History (Section 10.1)
explores in greater detail the ethical basis for sustainability and its cultural and historical signicance.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO SUSTAINABILITY: HUMANITY AND
THE ENVIRONMENT
1.3 The IPAT Equation9
As attractive as the concept of sustainability may be as a means of framing our thoughts and goals, its
denition is rather broad and dicult to work with when confronted with choices among specic courses of
action. The Chapter Problem-Solving, Metrics, and Tools for Sustainability (Section 9.1) is devoted
to various ways of measuring progress toward achieving sustainable goals, but here we introduce one general
way to begin to apply sustainability concepts: the IPAT equation.
As is the case for any equation, IPAT expresses a balance among interacting factors. It can be stated as
I = P × A × T (1.1)
where I represents the impacts of a given course of action on the environment, P is the relevant human
population for the problem at hand, A is the level of consumption per person, and T is impact per unit of
consumption. Impact per unit of consumption is a general term for technology, interpreted in its broadest
sense as any human-created invention, system, or organization that serves to either worsen or uncouple
consumption from impact. The equation is not meant to be mathematically rigorous; rather it provides a
way of organizing information for a rst-order analysis.
Suppose we wish to project future needs for maintaining global environmental quality at present day
levels for the mid-twenty-rst century. For this we need to have some projection of human population (P)
and an idea of rates of growth in consumption (A).
Figure 1.2: World Population Growth Source: U.S. Census Bureau, International Data Base,
December 2010 Update10
Figure World Population Growth (Figure 1.2) suggests that global population in 2050 will grow from
the current 6.8 billion to about 9.2 billion, an increase of 35%. Global GDP (Gross Domestic Product,
one measure of consumption) varies from year to year but, using Figure Worldwide Growth of Gross
Domestic Product (Figure 1.3) as a guide, an annual growth rate of about 3.5% seems historically accurate
(growth at 3.5%, when compounded for forty years, means that the global economy will be four times as
large at mid-century as today).

Thus if we wish to maintain environmental impacts (I) at their current levels (i.e. I2050 = I2010), then
P2010 × A2010 × T2010 = P2050 × A2050 × T2050 (1.3)

(1.3)
This means that just to maintain current environmental quality in the face of growing population and
levels of auence, our technological decoupling will need to reduce impacts by about a factor of ve. So,
for instance, many recently adopted climate action plans for local regions and municipalities, such as the
Chicago Climate Action Plan12 , typically call for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (admittedly just
one impact measure) of eighty percent by mid-century. The means to achieve such reductions, or even
whether or not they are necessary, are matters of intense debate; where one group sees expensive remedies
with little demonstrable return, another sees opportunities for investment in new technologies, businesses,
and employment sectors, with collateral improvements in global and national well-being.
1.4 Human Consumption Patterns and the Rebound Eect13
In 1865 William Jevons14 (1835-1882), a British economist, wrote a book entitled The Coal Question15
, in which he presented data on the depletion of coal reserves yet, seemingly paradoxically, an increase
in the consumption of coal in England throughout most of the 19th century. He theorized that signicant
improvements in the eciency of the steam engine had increased the utility of energy from coal and, in
eect, lowered the price of energy, thereby increasing consumption. This is known as the Jevons paradox,

10 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO SUSTAINABILITY: HUMANITY AND
THE ENVIRONMENT
the principle that as technological progress increases the eciency of resource utilization, consumption of
that resource will increase. Increased consumption that negates part of the eciency gains is referred to as
rebound, while overconsumption is called backre. Such a counter-intuitive theory has not been met
with universal acceptance, even among economists (see, for example, The Eciency Dilemma16 ). Many
environmentalists, who see improvements in eciency as a cornerstone of sustainability, openly question the
validity of this theory. After all, is it sensible to suggest that we not improve technological eciency?
Whether or not the paradox is correct, the fact that it has been postulated gives us pause to examine in
somewhat greater depth consumption patterns of society. If we let Q be the quantity of goods and services
delivered (within a given time period) to people, and R be the quantity of resources consumed in order to
deliver those goods and services, then the IPAT equation can be rewritten in a slightly dierent way as:
I = P ×

(1.3)
where h
R
Q

I
R

is the impact created per unit of resources consumed.
Rearranging this version of the equation gives:
R = Q ×

R
Q

(1.3)
which says simply that resources consumed are equal to the quantity of goods and services delivered times
the resource intensity. The inverse of resource intensity h
Q
R
i
is called the resource use eciency, also known
as resource productivity or eco-eciency, an approach that seeks to minimize environmental impacts
by maximizing material and energy eciencies of production. Thus we can say:
R = Q ×

1
Eco − eciency
(1.3)
that is, resources consumed are equal to goods and services delivered divided by eco-eciency. Whether or
not gains in eco-eciency yield genuine savings in resources and lower environmental impacts depends on
how much, over time, society consumes of a given product or service (i.e. the relative eciency gain, ∆e
e
)
must outpace the quantity of goods and services delivered ∆Q
Q
. In the terms of Jevons paradox, if ∆Q
Q ≥
∆e
e
then the system is experiencing backre.
Part of the problem in analyzing data pertaining to whether or not such overconsumption is happening
depends on the specic good or service in question, the degree to which the data truly represent that good
or service, and the level of detail that the data measure. Table Historical Eciency and Consumption
Trends in the United States (Table 1.1) summarizes some recent ndings from the literature on the
comparative eciency and consumption for several activities over extended periods of observation. Taken
collectively these activities capture several basic enabling aspects of modern society: major materials, transportation, energy generation, and food production. In all cases the data show that over the long term,
consumption outpaces gains in eciency by wide margins, (i.e., ∆Q
Q ≥
∆e
e
). It should also be noted that
in all cases, the increases in consumption are signicantly greater than increases in population. The data
of Table Historical Eciency and Consumption Trends in the United States (Table 1.1) do not
verify Jevons paradox; we would need to know something about the prices of these goods and services over
time, and examine the degree to which substitution might have occurred (for instance aluminum for iron, air
travel for automobile travel). To see if such large increases in consumption have translated into comparable
decreases in environmental quality, or declines in social equity, other information must be examined. Despite
this, the information presented does show a series of patterns that broadly reect human consumption of
goods and services that we consider essential for modern living and for which eciency gains have not kept
pace; in a world of nite resources such consumption patterns cannot continue indenitely.

Our consumption of goods and services creates a viable economy, and also reects our social needs. For
example, most of us consider it a social good that we can travel large distances rather quickly, safely, and
more or less whenever we feel the need. Similarly, we realize social value in having aluminum (lightweight,
strong, and ductile) available, in spite of its energy costs, because it makes so many conveniences, from air
travel to beverage cans, possible. This is at the center of the sustainability paradigm: human behavior is a
social and ethical phenomenon, not a technological one. Whether or not we must overconsume to realize
social benets is at the core of sustainable solutions to problems.

1.5 Challenges for Sustainability18
The concept of sustainability has engendered broad support from almost all quarters. In a relatively succinct
way it expresses the basis upon which human existence and the quality of human life depend: responsible
behavior directed toward the wise and ecient use of natural and human resources. Such a broad concept
invites a complex set of meanings that can be used to support divergent courses of action. Even within the
Brundtland Report a dichotomy exists: alarm over environmental degradation that typically results from
economic growth, yet seeing economic growth as the main pathway for alleviating wealth disparities.

12 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO SUSTAINABILITY: HUMANITY AND
THE ENVIRONMENT
The three main elements of the sustainability paradigm are usually thought of as equally important, and
within which tradeos are possible as courses of action are charted. For example, in some instances it may
be deemed necessary to degrade a particular ecosystem in order to facilitate commerce, or food production,
or housing. In reality, however, the extent to which tradeos can be made before irreversible damage results
is not always known, and in any case there are denite limits on how much substitution among the three
elements is wise (to date, humans have treated economic development as the dominant one of the three).
This has led to the notion of strong sustainability, where tradeos among natural, human, and social
capital are not allowed or are very restricted, and weak sustainability, where tradeos are unrestricted
or have few limits. Whether or not one follows the strong or weak form of sustainability, it is important to
understand that while economic and social systems are human creations, the environment is not. Rather, a
functioning environment underpins both society and the economy.
This inevitably leads to the problem of metrics: what should be measured and how should the values
obtained be interpreted, in light of the broad goals of the sustainability paradigm? The Chapter ProblemSolving, Metrics, and Tools for Sustainability (Section 9.1) addresses this in detail, but presented here
is a brief summary of the ndings of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment19 (MEA), a project undertaken
by over a thousand internationally recognized experts, from 2001-2005, who assessed the state of the world's
major ecosystems and the consequences for humans as a result of human-induced changes. In its simplest
form, a system20 is a collection of parts that function together. The MEA presents ndings as assessments
of ecosystems and ecosystem services: provisioning services such as food and water; regulating services
such as ood control, drought, and disease; supporting services such as soil formation and nutrient cycling;
and cultural services such as recreational, spiritual, religious and other nonmaterial benets. MEA presents
three overarching conclusions:
Approximately 60% (15 out of 24) of the ecosystem services examined are being degraded or
used unsustainably, including fresh water, capture sheries, air and water purication, and the
regulation of regional and local climate, natural hazards, and pests. The full costs of the loss
and degradation of these ecosystem services are dicult to measure, but the available evidence
demonstrates that they are substantial and growing. Many ecosystem services have been degraded
as a consequence of actions taken to increase the supply of other services, such as food. These
trade-os often shift the costs of degradation from one group of people to another or defer costs
to future generations.
There is established but incomplete evidence that changes being made are increasing the likelihood of nonlinear changes in ecosystems (including accelerating, abrupt, and potentially irreversible changes) that have important consequences for human well-being. Examples of such
changes include disease emergence, abrupt alterations in water quality, the creation of dead
zones in coastal waters, the collapse of sheries, and shifts in regional climate.
The harmful eects of the degradation of ecosystem services are being borne disproportionately
by the poor, are contributing to growing inequities and disparities across groups of people, and
are sometimes the principal factor causing poverty and social conict. This is not to say that
ecosystem changes such as increased food production have not also helped to lift many people
out of poverty or hunger, but these changes have harmed other individuals and communities, and
their plight has been largely overlooked. In all regions, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
the condition and management of ecosystem services is a dominant factor inuencing prospects
for reducing poverty.

Organizations such as the World Commission on Environment and Development, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and several others including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change21 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,22 and the National Academy Report to Congress23
have all issued reports on various aspects of the state of society and the environment. The members of these
groups are among the best experts available to assess the complex problems facing human society in the
21st century, and all have reached a similar conclusion: absent the enactment of new policies and practices
that confront the global issues of economic disparities, environmental degradation, and social inequality, the
future needs of humanity and the attainment of our aspirations and goals are not assured.

The Evolution of Environmental Policy
in the United States
2.1 The Evolution of Environmental Policy in the United States 
Chapter Introduction1
2.1.1 Introduction
It is not uncommon to think of the sustainability paradigm as being a recent interpretation of environmental
policy, one that was given credence by the United Nations report "Our Common Future" (the Brundtland
Report2
) when it was rst presented in 1987. Certainly the period during the nal decade of the twentieth
century was witness to signicant growth in our understanding of the complexity and global reach of many
environmental problems and issues, and as discussed in Chapter An Introduction to Sustainability:
Humanity and the Environment (Section 1.1), the Brundtland report gave a clear voice to these concerns
through its analysis of human dependency and quality of life on ecological systems, social networks, and
economic viabilitysystems that are closely intertwined and that require more integrated approaches to
solving the many problems that confront humanity at this time. It is also true that it was among the
rst widely disseminated writings to dene and use the modern meaning of the term "sustainable" through
the often-quoted concept of "sustainable development." However, it would be a mistake to conclude that
sustainability as a mental construct and policy framework for envisioning the relationship of humans and
nature came into being suddenly and at a single moment in time. Most environmental historians who have
studied U.S. policy have discerned at least three distinct periods during which new concepts and ideas,
scientic understandings, technological advances, political institutions, and laws and regulations came or
were brought into being in order to understand and manage human impacts on the environment. These were
(1) the American conservation movement, (2) the rise of environmental risk management as a basis for policy,
and (3) the integration of social and economic factors to create what we now refer to as the sustainability
paradigm. In this chapter we will explore the roots of modern sustainability (Module The American
Conservation Movement (Section 2.2)), see how our thinking about the environment has shifted (Module
Environmental Risk Management (Section 2.3)), and examine the ways that our environmental public
policies have changed through time (Module Sustainability and Public Policy (Section 2.4)). Along the
way it is important to understand that this has been an evolutionary process and that these environmental
"eras," while reecting the norms, attitudes, and needs of the day, are still very much embodied within the
modern concept of sustainability.

UNITED STATES
2.2 The American Conservation Movement3
2.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the history of environmental policy in the United States and the role of dierent groups in
shaping environmental policy
2.2.2 Introduction
To most early colonists who immigrated to North America, for whom the concept of wastage had no
specic meaning, the continent was a land of unimaginably vast resources in which little eort was made
to treat, minimize, or otherwise manage. This is not surprising, when one stand of trees was consumed for
housing or fuel, another was nearby; when one eld was eroded to the point of limited fertility, expansion
further inland was relatively simple; when rivers became silted so that sheries were impaired, one moved
further upstream; and when confronted with endless herds of wild animals, it was inconceivable that one
might over-consume to the point of extinction. European-settled America was a largely agrarian society
and, apart from the need to keep spaces productive and clear of debris, there was little incentive to spend
time and energy managing discharges to the commons4
 (see Module The Tragedy of the Commons
(Section 6.2)). These attitudes persisted well into the 19th century and aspects of them are still active in the
present day. While such practices could hardly be said to constitute an environmental policy, they did serve
the purpose of constellating a number of groups into rethinking the way we went about managing various
aspects of our lives, in particular our relationship to the land and the resources it contained or provided.
As early as the mid-18th century, Jared Eliot5
(1685-1763) of Connecticut, a minister, doctor, and farmer,
wrote a series of treatises on the need for better farming methods. He summarized:
When our fore-Fathers settled here, they entered a Land which probably never had been Ploughed
since the Creation, the Land being new they depended upon the natural Fertility of the Ground,
which served their purpose very well, and when they had worn out one piece they cleared another,
without any concern to amend their Land. . .(Carman, Tugwell, & True, 1934, p. 29 (p. 26)).
Although Eliot avidly instructed his fellow farmers on better methods of eld husbandry, there is little
evidence that his writings had a lasting eect (he is most known for advances in the design of the drill
plough, an early planter that produced even rows of crops, increasing yields).
By 1850, the population of the United States was approaching 25 million and increasing at the rate of
three to four percent per year (for comparison the population of England was about 26 million, of France 36
million, and Germany about 40 million). Although the westward migration across North America was well
underway, most people still lived within a relatively narrow strip of land along the east coast. By modern
measures the United States was not densely populated, and yet the perception of the country as big and
on the international stage was in contrast to the mentality just a few decades before of a new world that had
broken with the old, one of endless open spaces and inexhaustible resources. The country was also becoming
more urbanized (about 15 percent of the population lived in cities, three times the proportion of just fty
years before), and increasingly literate.
Thus by the mid-19th century the American public was prepared to listen to the messages of various
groups who had become concerned about the impacts of growth on society. Three groups in particular, of
considerably dierent sympathies and character, came to have profound inuences on the way we thought
of ourselves in relation to the environment, on our land use policies, and on providing environmental goods
and services to the growing population: the resource eciency group, the transcendentalist movement, and
organized industrial interests.

2.2.3 Resource Eciency
As typied by the concerns of Jared Eliot nearly a century before, there were always some who were alarmed
at widespread agricultural practices that were wasteful, inecient and, using the modern terminology, unsustainable. By the early 1800s the cumulative impacts of soil erosion and infertility, decreasing crop yields,
and natural barriers to expansion such as terrain and poor transportation to markets led to an organized
eort to understand the causes of these problems, invent and experiment with new, more soil-conserving and
less wasteful practices, communicate what was being learned to the public, and begin to build government
institutions to promote better stewardship of the land and its resources. Although initial conservation concerns were associated with farming, the same approach soon found its way into the management of forests
and timbering, wastes from mining and smelting, and by the end of the century the control of human disease
outbreaks (most commonly associated with cholera and typhoid) and the impact of chemical exposure on
workers. There were many individuals who contributed to understanding the scientic underpinnings of the
environment and educating practitioners: Eugene Hilgard6
(agricultural science), John Wesley Powell7
(water rights), George Perkins Marsh8
(ecological science), Franklin Hough9 and Giord Pinchot10 (sustainable
forestry), J. Sterling Morton11 (forestry and environmental education; co-founder of Arbor Day12 ), Frederick
Law Olmsted13 (landscape architecture), and Alice Hamilton14 (industrial hygiene), to name a few. These
resource conservationists were instrumental in applying scientic methods to solving the problems of the
day, problems that were rooted in our behavior toward the environment, and that had serious consequences
for the well-being of people. It was as a result of these eorts that the basis for the elds of environmental
science and engineering, agronomy and agricultural engineering, and public health was established. Over
time these elds have grown in depth and breadth, and have led to the establishment of new areas of inquiry.
Just as importantly, several federal institutions were created to oversee the implementation of reforms
and manage the government's large land holdings. Legislation forming the Departments of the Interior15
(1849), and Agriculture16 (1862), the U.S. Forest Service17 (1881), the Geological Survey18 (1879), and the
National Park Service19 (1916) were all enacted during this period. It was also the time when several major
conservation societies, still active today, came into being: the Audubon Society20 (1886), the Sierra Club21
(1892), and the National Wildlife Federation22 (1935). Arbor Day was rst celebrated in 1872, and Bird
Day23 in 1894.
2.2.4 The Transcendental Movement
It is beyond the scope of this text to analyze in great depth the basis of the transcendental movement24 in
America. It arose in the 1830s in reaction to the general state of culture and society, increasing urbanism, and
the rigidity of organized religions of the time. It professed a way of thinking in which the individual's unique
relationship to their surroundings was valued over conformity and unreective habits of living. But however

UNITED STATES
philosophical its aims and ethereal its goals, transcendentalism had a profound connection to the natural
environment; indeed, it is dicult to understand without reference to human-environmental interactions
and a re-envisioning of the social contract of humanity with nature. Such were conditions at the time that
transcendentalism resonated with an increasingly literate society, and became a major force in the further
development of conservation as an accepted part of the American experience.
The acknowledged leader of the transcendental movement was Ralph Waldo Emerson25 (1803-1882). In
his seminal essay Nature26 (1836), Emerson sets the tone for a new way of envisioning our relation to the
natural world:
To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the sun. At least they have a
very supercial seeing. The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart
of the child. The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each
other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. His intercourse with heaven and
earth, becomes part of his daily food. In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in
spite of real sorrows. Nature says,  he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs, he shall be
glad with me. Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute of delight; for
every hour and change corresponds to and authorizes a dierent state of the mind, from breathless noon to
grimmest midnight. Nature is a setting that ts equally well a comic or a mourning piece. In good health,
the air is a cordial of incredible virtue. Crossing a bare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a
clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect
exhilaration. I am glad to the brink of fear. In the woods too, a man casts o his years, as the snake his
slough, and at what period so ever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these
plantations of God, a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not
how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel
that nothing can befall me in life,  no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot
repair. Standing on the bare ground,  my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into innite space,
 all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the
Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds
then foreign and accidental: to be brothers, to be acquaintances,  master or servant, is then a trie and a
disturbance. I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I nd something more
dear and connate than in streets or villages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of
the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature. (Emerson, 1836 (p. 26)).
Here Emerson makes clear that his connection to the Universal Being is made possible through communion with Nature, a creation so much greater than he that he sees his physical reality as nothing, but his
true nature (i.e. his soul) becomes visible in the tranquil landscape, and the distant line of the horizon.
Such metaphorical language was and remains a powerful reminder that our existence is dependent on the
natural world, and that we mismanage the environment at our peril.

UNITED STATES
might be expected, the counter-reaction to the state of society and its attitudes toward the environment found
expression in other media as well, in particular the rise of a cadre of American landscape artists. The camera
had not yet been perfected, and of course there was no electronic media to compete for people's attention,
thus artists' renditions of various scenes, especially landscapes, were quite popular. Figure Kindred Spirits
(Figure 2.1), a rendering by A.B. Durand (1796-1886) of an artist and a poet out for a hike amid a lush
forest scene captures much of the essence of transcendental thought, which had strongly inuenced Durand's
style. The oset of the human subjects, to left-of-center, is purposeful: the main subject is nature, with
humans merely a component. This theme carried through many of the landscapes of the period, and helped
to dene what became known, among others, as the Hudson River School28 , whose artists depicted nature
as an otherwise inexpressible manifestation of God. This is further expressed in the painting, In the Heart
of the Andes, by Frederic Church (Figure In the Heart of the Andes (Figure 2.2)). Here, the seemingly
sole theme is the landscape itself, but closer inspection (see detail in red square) reveals a small party of
people, perhaps engaged in worship, again oset and virtually invisible amid the majesty of the mountains.

Other notable contributors to the transcendental movement were Henry David Thoreau30 (1817-1862),
abolitionist and author of Walden and Civil Disobedience, Margaret Fuller31 (1810-1850), who edited the
transcendental journal The Dial and wrote Woman in the Nineteenth Century, widely considered the rst
American feminist work, and Walt Whitman32 (1819-1892) whose volume of poetry Leaves of Grass celebrates
both the human form and the human mind as worthy of praise.
It is important to recognize that the transcendental redenition of our social contract with the environment was holistic. Within it can be found not only a new appreciation of nature, but also the liberation
of the human mind from convention and formalism, attacks on slavery, the need for racial equality, concern

for universal surage and women's rights, and gender equity. In many ways it was a repositioning of the
ideals of the enlightenment33 that had gured so prominently in the founding documents of the republic.
These social concerns are represented today within the sustainability paradigm in the form of such issues as
environmental justice34 , consumer behavior, and labor relations.
Transcendentalism as a formal movement diminished during the latter half of the 19th century, but it
had a far-reaching inuence on the way society perceived itself relative to the environment. Perhaps no
one is more responsible for translating its aspirations into environmental public policy than John Muir35
(1838-1914), a Scottish-born immigrant who was heavily inuenced by Emerson's writings (it is said that the
young Muir carried with him a copy of Nature from Scotland). The two rst met in 1871 during a camping
trip to the Sierra Mountains of California. Upon learning of Emerson's planned departure, Muir wrote to
him on May 8, 1871 hoping to convince him to stay longer, I invite you join me in a months worship with
Nature in the high temples of the great Sierra Crown beyond our holy Yosemite. It will cost you nothing
save the time & very little of that for you will be mostly in Eternity (Chou, 2003 (p. 26)).
Muir was a naturalist, author, organizer (founder of the Sierra Club), and as it turns out a remarkably
eective political activist and lobbyist. His association with Theodore Roosevelt36 (1858-1919, 26th president
of the United States), began with a 1903 campaign visit by Roosevelt to California, where he specically
sought out Muir, whose reputation was by then well known, as a guide to the Yosemite area (see Figure
Roosevelt and Muir (Figure 2.3)).

but cordial exchanges; for example, upon viewing the giant Sequoias, Muir remarked37 to Roosevelt, God
has cared for these trees. . .but he cannot save them from fools  only Uncle Sam can do that. Roosevelt
was so taken with his companion that he insisted they avoid political crowds and camp together overnight
in the mountains.
The subsequent legacy of the Roosevelt administration in the name of conservation, even by today's
standards, was signicant. Known as the conservation president, Roosevelt was responsible for 225 million
acres of land added to the U.S. Forest Service, and the creation of 50 wildlife refuges and 150 national forests
representing, in total, 11 percent of the total land area of the 48 contiguous states.
2.2.5 The Role of Industry
Today the behavior of industry toward the environment is often portrayed as either indierent or hostile,
whether true or not, and it was no dierent during the formative period of American conservation. The
industries of the day  agriculture, timber, and mining  enabled by the major transportation sector 
railroads and steamboats  had little incentive to manage their emissions to the environment responsibly,
or to use natural resources wisely. Regulations were few, the science underpinning environmental impacts
was nascent, the commons itself was viewed as essentially innite, and however misguided, exploitation of
resources and the generation of a certain amount of waste was seen as a necessary byproduct of expansion, job
creation, and social well-being. And yet, as human-created organizations go, industries are extraordinarily
sensitive to economic conditions. If the sustainability paradigm is to be believed, then economic viability is of
paramount concern and the engagement of industrial forces must of necessity be part of its enactment. These
are the engines that provide employment, and that control large quantities of capital for investment. Further,
viewed from the life cycle perspective of the ow of materials (refer to Module Life Cycle Assessment
(Section 9.2)), products that turn raw materials into mostly waste (dened here as a quantity of material
that no one values, as opposed to salable products) are simply inecient and reduce protability.

.
As noted in Resource Eciency (Section 2.2.3: Resource Eciency) above, industrial activities during
this time were responsible for signicant environmental degradation. Policy reformers of the day, such as Carl
Schurz39 (as secretary of the Interior) turned their attention in particular to land reforms, which impacted the
expansion of railroads, and forest preservation. And yet, industry played an unquestionable role as enablers
of societal shifts occurring in America by making goods and services available, increasing the wealth of the
emerging middle class, and in particular providing relatively rapid access to previously inaccessible locations
 in many cases the same locations that preservationists were trying to set aside. Reading, hearing stories
about, and looking at pictures of landscapes of remote beauty and open spaces was alluring and stirred
the imagination, but being able to actually visit these places rsthand was an educational experience that
had transformative powers. Alfred Bierstadt's The Oregon Trail (Figure The Oregon Trail (Figure 2.4)),
painted in 1868, depicts the westward migration of settlers via wagon trains, on horseback, and simply
walking  a journey, not without peril, that took about six months. The next year saw the completion of
the transcontinental railroad40 , and within a few years it became possible to complete the same journey in
as little as six days in comparative comfort and safety.
The movement to designate certain areas as national parks is an illustrative example of the role of industry in promoting land conservation, thereby setting in motion subsequent large conservation set-asides
that reached their zenith during the Roosevelt administration. It began, in 1864, with the eorts of several
California citizens to have the U.S. Congress accept most of Yosemite41 , which had been under the protection of the State of California as a national preserve. The petition cited its value for public use, resort,

UNITED STATES
and recreation, reasoning that already reected the combined interests of the resource eciency group,
preservationists, and business opportunists. Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), the landscape architect
most well known for the design of New York's Central Park, and an ardent believer in the ability of open
spaces to improve human productivity, oversaw the initial eorts to manage the Yosemite area. Although
the eort was infused with renewed vigor after John Muir's arrival in the late 1860s, it wasn't until 1906
that the park was ocially designated.
In the meantime, similar interests had grown to name Yellowstone42 as a national park, with the same
basic justication as for Yosemite. Since there were no states as yet formed in the region the pathway
was more straightforward, and was made considerably easier by the lack of interest by timber and mining
companies to exploit (the area was thought to have limited resource value), and the railroads who, seeing
potential for signicant passenger trac, lobbied on its behalf. Thus the rst national park was ocially
designated in 1872, only three years after the completion of the transcontinental railroad. Indeed, in relatively
rapid succession the Union Pacic Railroad got behind the Yosemite eorts, and the Northern Pacic Railroad
lobbied heavily for the creation of parks at Mount Rainier43 (1899) and Glacier44 (1910). By 1916, when the
National Park Service was formed, sixteen national parks had been created. States too began to see value
in creating and, to a degree, preserving open spaces, as evidenced by New York's Adirondack Park45 (1894),
still the largest single section of land in the forty-eight contiguous states dedicated to be forever wild.
2.2.6 Results of the American Conservation Movement
With the advent of the First World War, and subsequent political, social, and economic unrest that lasted
for another thirty years, actions motivated by the conservation movement declined. The coalition between
the resource eciency group and those wishing to preserve nature, always uncomfortable, was further eroded
when it became clear that the main reason Congress was setting aside various areas was mainly to better
manage commercial exploitation. And yet, the period from 1850 to 1920 left a remarkable legacy of environmental reform, and laid the foundation for future advances in environmental policy. In summary, the
conservation movement accomplished the following:
• Redened the social contract between humans and the environment, establishing a legacy of conservation as part of the American character, and a national model for the preservation of natural beauty.
• Invented the concept of national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, and other sites for commercial and
recreational uses by society.
• Developed the rst scientic understanding of how the environment functioned, integrating the scientic
approach to resource management into government policy.
• Pioneered technological practices to improve resource management.
• Established the major federal institutions with responsibility for land and resource conservation.
• Communicated the impact of pollution on human health and welfare.
• Through publications and travel, exposed many to the beauty of the natural environment and the
consequences of human activities.
• Finally, although sustainability as a way of envisioning ourselves in relation to the environment was
still many years away, already its three principal elements, imperfectly integrated at the time, are seen
clearly to be at work.

2.3 Environmental Risk Management47
2.3.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• trace the basic elements of the sustainability paradigm through the evolution of U.S. environmental
policy, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970
• understand the role of risk management as modern environmental policy has been implemented
2.3.2 General Denitions
For most people, the concept of risk is intuitive and, often, experiential; for instance most people are aware
of the considerably greater likelihood of suering an injury in an automobile accident (116/100 million
vehicle miles) versus suering an injury in a commercial airplane accident (0.304/100 million airplane miles).
Environmental risk can be dened as the chance of harmful eects to human health or to ecological systems
resulting from exposure to any physical, chemical, or biological entity in the environment that can induce
an adverse response (see Module Risk Assessment Methodology for Conventional and Alternative
Sustainability Options (Section 7.5) for more detail on the science of risk assessment). Environmental
risk assessment48 is a quantitative way of arriving at a statistical probability of an adverse action occurring.
It has four main steps:
1. Identication of the nature and end point of the risk (e.g. death or disability from hazardous chemicals,
loss of ecological diversity from habitat encroachment, impairment of ecosystem services, etc.)
2. Development of quantitative methods of analysis (perturbation-eect, dose-response)
3. Determination of the extent of exposure (i.e. fate, transport, and transformation of contaminants to
an exposed population), and
4. Calculation of the risk, usually expressed as a statistical likelihood.
Risk management49 is distinct from risk assessment, and involves the integration of risk assessment with
other considerations, such as economic, social, or legal concerns, to reach decisions regarding the need for
and practicability of implementing various risk reduction activities. Finally, risk communication50 consists
of the formal and informal processes of communication among various parties who are potentially at risk
from or are otherwise interested in the threatening agent/action. It matters a great deal how a given risk is
communicated and perceived: do we have a measure of control, or are we subject to powerful unengaged or
arbitrary forces?
2.3.3 The Beginnings of Modern Risk Management
The beginnings of environmental risk management can be traced to the elds of public health51 , industrial
hygiene52 , and sanitary engineering53 , which came into prominence in the latter decades of the 19th

UNITED STATES
century and beginning of the 20th. The spread of disease was a particularly troublesome problem as the
country continued to urbanize. For instance if you lived your life in, say, Chicago during the period 1850-
190054 (a typical lifespan of the day), you had about a 1 in 100 chance of dying of cholera55 (and a 1 in
2000 chance of dying of typhoid), of which there were periodic epidemics spread by contaminated drinking
water. Chicago's solution was to cease polluting its drinking water source (Lake Michigan) by reversing
the ow of its watercourses so that they drained into the adjacent basin (the Mississippi). The widespread
chlorination56 of municipal water after 1908 essentially eliminated waterborne outbreaks of disease in all
major cities (with some notable exceptionsthe outbreak of chlorine-resistant Cryptosporidium parvum in
Milwaukee's drinking water57 in 1993 resulted in the infection of 403,000 people with 104 deaths).
Parallel work on the eects of chemical exposure on workers (and poor working conditions in general)
were pioneered by Alice Hamilton (1869-1970), who published the rst treatise on toxic chemical exposure
"Industrial Poisons in the United States" in 1925. Hamilton is considered the founder of the eld of occupational health58 . In 1897 she was appointed professor of pathology at the Women's Medical School of
Northwestern University, and in 1902 she accepted the position of bacteriologist at the Memorial Institute
for Infectious Diseases in Chicago. Dr. Hamilton joined Jane Addams's Hull House59 , in Chicago, where
she interacted with progressive thinkers who often gravitated there, and to the needs of the poor for whom
Hull House provided services.
2.3.4 Environmental Contamination and Risk
Events during the period 1920-1950 took an unfortunate turn. Global conicts and economic uncertainty
diverted attention from environmental issues, and much of what had been learned during the previous
hundred years, for example about soil conservation and sustainable forestry, ceased to inuence policy, with
resultant mismanagement on a wide scale (see Figures Texas Dust Storm (Figure 2.5) and Clear Cutting,
Louisiana, 1930 (Figure 2.6)).

In the aftermath of the World War II, economic and industrial activity in the United States accelerated,
and a consumer-starved populace sought and demanded large quantities of diverse goods and services. Major
industrial sectors, primary metals, automotive, chemical, timber, and energy expanded considerably; however
there were still few laws or regulations on waste management, and the ones that could and often were
invoked (e.g. the Rivers and Harbors Act of 189962 ) were devised in earlier times for problems of a dierent
nature. The Module Systems of Waste Management (Section 7.2) provides a more detailed accounting
of the current framework for managing waste. Here we recount the circumstances that eventually resulted

If there were any doubts among American society that the capacity of the natural environment to absorb
human-caused contamination with acceptably low risk was indeed innite, these were dispelled by a series
of well-publicized incidents that occurred during the period 1948-1978. Figure Zinc Smelter (Figure 2.7)
shows a local smelter in a small valley town in Pennsylvania with, essentially, uncontrolled emissions. During
periods of atmospheric stability (an inversion), contaminants became trapped, accumulated, and caused
respiratory distress so extraordinary that fty deaths were recorded. Figure Noon in Donora (Figure 2.8)
illustrates the dramatically poor air quality, in the form of reduced visibility, during this episode. Such
incidents were not uncommon, nor were they limited to small American towns. A well-documented similar
episode occurred in London, England in 195264 with at least 4000 deaths, and 100,000 illnesses resulting.

The generally poor state of air quality in the United States was initially tolerated as a necessary condition
of an industrialized society. Although the risks of occupational exposure to chemicals was becoming more
well known, the science of risk assessment as applied to the natural environment was in its infancy, and the
notion that a polluted environment could actually cause harm was slow to be recognized, and even if true
it was not clear what might be done about it. Nevertheless, people in the most contaminated areas could
sense the eects of poor air quality: increased incidence of respiratory disease, watery eyes, odors, inability
to enjoy being outside for more than a few minutes, and diminished visibility.

Environmental degradation of the era was not limited to air quality. Emissions of contaminants to
waterways and burial underground were simple and common ways to dispose of wastes. Among the most
infamous episodes in pollution history were the periodic res that oated through downtown Cleveland, Ohio
on the Cuyahoga River67 , causing considerable damage (Figure Cuyahoga River Fire 1969 (Figure 2.9)),

34 CHAPTER 2. THE EVOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN THE
UNITED STATES
2.3.5 Risk Management as a Basis for Environmental Policy
Environmental scientists of the day were also alarmed by the extent and degree of damage that they were
documenting. The publication of Silent Spring68 in 1962 by Rachel Carson69 (1907-1964), about the impact
of the widespread and indiscriminate use of pesticides, was a watershed moment, bringing environmental
concerns before a large portion of the American, and global, public. Carson, a marine biologist and conservationist who initially worked for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, became a full time nature writer in the
1950s. She collected scientically documented evidence on the eects of pesticides, particularly DDT70 , heptachlor71 , and dieldrin72 , on humans and mammals, and the systemic disruption they caused to ecosystems.
Silent Spring is credited with bringing about a ban on the use of DDT73 in the United States, and setting in
motion a chain of events that would ultimately result in the transformation of environmental public policy
from one based on the problems and attitudes that brought about nineteenth century conservation, to one
based on the management of risks from chemical toxins. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency74 was
established in 1970, just eight years after the publication of Silent Spring. The same year Earth Day75 was
created.
As noted, the modules in the Chapter Modern Environmental Management (Section 7.1) contain
a comprehensive treatment of the major laws and regulations that underpin the risk management approach
to environmental policy. However it is worth considering one law in particular at this point, the National
Environmental Policy Act76 of 1970 (NEPA), because it provides a legal basis for U.S. environmental policy,
and lays out its terms clearly and unambiguously. NEPA established a national goal to create and maintain
"conditions under which [humans] and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulll the social, economic
and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans[emphasis added]" (NEPA, 1970 (p.
35)). Further, NEPA saw the need for long term planning, to "fulll the responsibilities of each generation
as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations," for equity "to assure for all Americans safe,
healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings," and for economic prosperity
as we "achieve a balance between population and resource use that will permit high standards of living and
a wide sharing of life's amenities" (NEPA, 1970 (p. 35)). Although the exact word "sustainable" does not
appear, NEPA is in all major respects congruent with the goals of the Brundtland Report (written 17 years
later, see Chapter Introduction to Sustainability: Humanity and the Environment (Section 1.1)),
retains the character of American conservation, and anticipates the need to integrate environmental quality
with social and economic needs.
Every four to six years the U.S. EPA releases its Report on the Environment77 , a collection of data and
analysis of trends on environmental quality. It is quite comprehensive; reporting on an array of measures
that chart progress, or lack thereof, on human impacts on the environment and, in turn, the eects of our
actions on human health. It is dicult to summarize all the information available in a concise way, however
most measures of human exposure to toxic chemicals, dating in many cases back to the late 1980s, show clear
downward trends, in some cases dramatically so (for example DDT in human tissues, lead in blood serum,
exposure to hazardous wastes from improper disposal, exposure to toxic compounds emitted to the air). In
addition, many of other indicators of environmental quality such as visibility, drinking water quality, and
the biodiversity of streams, show improvement. These are success stories of the risk management approach
to environmental quality. On the other hand, other measures, such as hypoxia in coastal waters, quantities
of hazardous wastes generated, and greenhouse gases released are either not improving or are getting worse.

2.4 Sustainability and Public Policy79
2.4.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the problem-driven nature of policy development, from relatively local agricultural problems to regional problems often driven by industrial development to global problems associated with
population-driven human consumption
2.4.2 Complex Environmental Problems
NEPA, both in tone and purpose, was in sharp contrast to the many environmental laws that followed in the
1970s and 1980s that dened increasingly proscriptive methods for controlling risks from chemical exposure
(this is sometimes termed the "command-and-control80 " approach to environmental management). In many
ways these laws and regulations are ill-suited to the types of environmental problems that have emerged in
the past twenty years. Whereas the focus of our environmental policy has been on mitigating risk from
local problems that are chemical  and media  (land, water, or air) specic, the need has arisen to address
problems that are far more complex, multi-media, and are of large geographic, sometimes global, extent.
An early example of this type of shift in the complexity of environmental problems is illustrated by the
phenomenon of acidic rainfall81 , a regional problem that occurs in many areas across the globe. Although
the chemical cause of acid rain is acidic gases (such as sulfur dioxide82 and nitrogen oxides83 ) released into
the atmosphere from combustion processes (such as coal burning), the problem was made considerably worse
because of the approach to problem solving typical of the day for episodes such as the Donora disaster (see
Figures Zinc Smelter (Figure 2.7) and Noon in Donora (Figure 2.8)).

rainfall pH in the United States for the year 1996. Source: National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network via National Park Service84
.
In order to prevent the local accumulation of contaminants, emission stacks were made much taller,
eectively relying on the diluting power of the atmosphere to disperse oending pollutants. The result was a
signicant increase in the acidity of rainfall downwind of major sources, with associated impacts on aquatic
and forest resources. Figure Hydrogen Ion Concentrations as pH for 1996 (Figure 2.11) shows this
pattern for the eastern United States in 1996. A more comprehensive solution to this problem (short of
replacing coal as a fuel source), has involved integrated activity on many fronts: science to understand the
impacts of acid rain, technology to control the release of acidic gases, politics in the form of amendments
to the Clean Air Act85 , social equity that dened the role of regional responsibilities in the face of such
large geographic disparities, and economics to understand the total costs of acid rain and design markets86
to spread the costs of control. Although acidic rainfall is still an issue of concern, its impacts have been
mitigated to a signicant degree.

2.4.3 Sustainability as a Driver of Environmental Policy
The level of complexity illustrated by the acid rain problem can be found in a great many other environmental
problems today, among them:
• Hypoxic87 conditions in coastal regions of the world caused by excessive release of nutrients, principally
dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous from articial fertilizer applied to crops (in addition to the Gulf
of Mexico88 and Chesapeake Bay89 in the United States, there are over 400 such areas worldwide90 ),
• Stratospheric ozone depletion91 caused by the release of certain classes of chlorouorocarbon92 compounds used as propellants and refrigerants (with increases in the incident of skin cancers and
cataracts),
• Urbanization93 and sprawl94 , whereby the population density in urban areas, with its attendant
problems (degradation of air and water quality, stormwater management95 , habitat destruction, infrastructure renewal, health care needs, trac congestion, loss of leisure time, issues of social equality),
continues to grow (for example eighty percent of the population of the United States, about fty percent
of global, now lives in urban regions),
• Global climate change96 , and its resultant impacts (increases in temperature and storm and ooding
frequency, ocean acidication97 , displacement of human populations, loss of biodiversity, sea-level
rise), caused by the human-induced emission of greenhouse gases98
.
Problems such as these, which require highly integrated solutions that include input from many disciplines
and stakeholders, have been termed "wicked" (Batie, 2008 (p. 38); Kreuter, DeRosa, Howze, & Baldwin,
2004 (p. 38)). Wicked problems have certain key characteristics:
• There is not universal agreement on what the problem is  dierent stakeholders dene it dierently.
• There is no dened end solution, the end will be assessed as "better" or "worse."
• The problem may change over time.
• There is no clear stopping rule  stakeholders, political forces and resource availability will make that
determination on the basis of "judgments."
• The problem is associated with high uncertainty of both components and outcomes.
• Values and societal goals are not necessarily shared by those dening the problem or those attempting
to make the problem better.
Wicked problems are not conned to environmental issues, for example the same characteristics arise for
problems such as food safety, health care disparities, and terrorism, but in the context of environmental
policy they create the need to reassess policy approaches and goals, laws and regulations, as well as methods
and models for integrated research.
Table The Evolution of U.S. Environmental Policy (Table 2.1) summarizes the major attributes
of U.S. environmental policy as it has evolved over the past two centuries. To most observers it would
seem to be true that advances in public policy, in any realm, are driven by problems, real and perceived,
that require systemic solutions. Environmental policy is no exception. Early conservationists were alarmed
at the ineciencies of human resource management and the encroachment of humans on unspoiled lands.

alarmed and fearful of the consequences of toxic pollutant loads to the environment that included localized
eects on human health and well-being. And now, as we proceed into the 21st century, an array of complex
problems that have the potential to alter substantially the structure and well-being of large segments of
human societies, calls for a renewal and reassessment of our approach to environmental policy. This has,
thus far, proven to be a dicult transition. Many of these complex problems have multiple causes and
impacts, aect some groups of people more than others, are economically demanding, and are often not as
visibly apparent to casual observers as previous impacts, nor are the benets perceived to be commensurate
with costs. Devising a regulatory strategy for such problems requires an adaptive and exible approach that
current laws do not foster.

2.5 Public Health and Sustainability99
2.5.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand what public health is
• recognize public health impacts of non-sustainable development
• identify key public health impacts of climate change
2.5.2 Introduction
Much discussion about sustainability treats the economy, livelihoods, environmental conditions, our cities
and infrastructure, and social relations as if they were ends in themselves; as if they are the reason we seek
sustainability. Yet their prime value is as the foundations upon which our longer-term health and survival
depend. (McMichael, 2006 (p. 47))
Ecological sustainability is more than just continuing the resource ows of the natural world to sustain
the economic machine, while maintaining diversity of species and ecosystems. It is also about sustaining the
vast support systems for health and life which could be considered the real bottom line of sustainability.
Before examining the public health eects of non-sustainable development, we should dene public health.
• The website for UIC's School of Public Health100 says we are passionate about improving the health
and well-being of the people of Chicago, the state of Illinois, the nation and the world.
• The Illinois Department of Public Health101 is responsible for protecting the state's 12.4 million residents, as well as countless visitors, through the prevention and control of disease and injury.
• The New Zealand Ministry of Health102 denes it as the science and art of promoting health, preventing
disease and prolonging life through organized eorts of society.
• The National Resources Defense Council103 an NGO devoted to environmental action, states that
public health is the health or physical well-being of a whole community.
2.5.3 Impacts of Non-Sustainable Development
We have built our communities in ways that are unsustainable from many aspects. Not only does development
create urban sprawl, impact land use, and fuel consumption, we can identify negative health consequences
related to these development trends.
2.5.3.1 Obesity
If our communities are not walkable or bikeable, we need to drive to schools, shops, parks, entertainment,
play dates, etc. Thus we become more sedentary. A sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of overall mortality
(2 to 3-fold), cardiovascular disease (3 to 5-fold), and some types of cancer, including colon and breast cancer.
The eect of low physical tness is comparable to that of hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and even
smoking (Wei et al., 1999 (p. 48); Blair et al., 1996 (p. 47)).

UNITED STATES
2.5.3.2 Economic Segregation
Walkable and safe communities provide sidewalks, bike paths, proximity, and connections to community
services such as grocery stores, schools, health care, parks, and entertainment. Community design that
creates a segregated housing environment with only expensive housing and no aordable housing segregates
people by socio-economic level (i.e. poor from non-poor) and this generally leads to segregation by race.
Lack of physical activity will occur in neighborhoods with no good green and safe recreational sites. If we
have poor public transit systems partly due to lack of density (only more expensive, low-density housing)
and our love of the automobile, then we have increased emissions that contribute to global warming.
2.5.3.3 The Olympics as an Example
A natural experiment during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta shows the impact of car use
on health. During the games, peak morning trac decreased 23% and peak ozone levels decreased 28%.
Asthma-related emergency room visits by children decreased 42% while children's emergency visits for nonasthma causes did not change during same period (Friedman, Powell, Hutwagner, Graham, & Teague, 2001
(p. 47)). We also saw that with the Beijing Olympics in 2008 where driving days were rationed, more
than 300,000 heavy-emitting vehicles (about 10% of total) were barred from the city's administrative area
in order to decrease pollution for athletes and visitors This reduced the number of vehicles by about 1.9
million or 60% of the total eet during the Olympic Games. Emissions of black carbon, carbon monoxide
and ultrane particles were reduced by 33%, 47%, and 78% respectively compared to the year before the
Olympics. Frequency of respiratory illnesses during the 2008 games were found to be signicantly less in
certain populations compared to previous years and this was hypothesized to be related to the reduction of
vehicles on the road (Wang et al., 2009 (p. 47); Jentes et al., 2010 (p. 47)).

Figure Minutes Americans Walk per Day (Figure 2.12) shows the average time Americans spend
walking a day. People who walk to and from public transit get an fair amount of physical activity related

to using transit, thus the name given to modes of transit that do not involve driving: active transit. Those
people who did not own a car or were not a primary driver had higher walking times (Besser & Dannenberg,
2005 (p. 47)).
2.5.3.4 Water Quality
Increasing numbers of roads and parking lots are needed to support an automobile transportation system,
which lead to increased non-point source water pollution and contamination of water supplies (road runo of
oil/gas, metals, nutrients, organic waste, to name a few) with possible impacts on human health. Increased
erosion and stream siltation causes environmental damage and may aect water treatment plants and thus
aect water quality.
2.5.3.5 Social Capital
On the social sustainability side, we can look at social capital otherwise dened as the connectedness of a
group built through behaviors such as social networking and civic engagement, along with attitudes such as
trust and reciprocity. Greater social capital has been associated with healthier behaviors, better self-rated
health, and less negative results such as heart disease. However, social capital has been diminishing over
time. Proposed causes include long commute times, observed in sprawling metropolitan areas. Past research
suggests that long commute times are associated with less civic participation; Robert Putnam suggests that
every ten additional minutes of commuting predicts a 10% decline in social capital (Besser, Marcus, &
Frumkin, 2008 (p. 47)). Urban sprawl is considered the reason for most long commutes.
As of 2011, according to an article in the Chicago Tribune105 , Chicago commuting times are some of
the worst  with Chicagoans spending 70 hours per year more on the road than they would if there was no
congestion  up from 18 hours in 1982. They have an average commute time of 34 minutes each way. These
drivers also use 52 more gallons per year per commuter, increasing their costs and pollution.
Residents of sprawling counties were likely to walk less during leisure time, weigh more, and have greater
prevalence of hypertension than residents of compact counties (Ewing, Schmid, Killingsworth, Zlot, & Raudenbush (p. 47), 2003 (p. 47)).
While more compact development is found to have a negative impact on weight, we also nd that
individuals with low BMI are more likely to select locations with dense development. This suggests that
eorts to curb sprawl, and thereby make communities more exercise-friendly, may simply attract those
individuals who are predisposed to physical activity (Plantinga & (p. 47)Bernell, 2007 (p. 47)).
2.5.4 Impacts of Climate Change
Public health studies have been conducted with regard to many of the predicted environmental eects of
climate change. Thus, it is somewhat easier to examine the public health implications of this outcome of
unsustainable behavior. Figure How Climate Change Aects Population (Figure 2.13) describes the
pathways by which climate change aects public health. To the left we see the natural and anthropogenic, or
human-caused activities that aect climate change, which result in climatic conditions and variability; if we
can mitigate those events we can reduce climate change. These activities rst result in environmental impacts
such as severe weather events, disturbed ecosystems, sea-level rise, and overall environmental degradation.
Those impacts can then result in a broad range of health eects that we can adapt to, to a certain extent.
These impacts are generally categorized into three areas: heat induced morbidity and mortality, infectious
diseases, and impacts due to the eect of extreme weather such as ooding and drought on the social welfare
of the population.

by which climate change aects population health. Source:Created by Cindy Klein-Banai, based on
McMichael et al., 2006 (p. 47)
Measurement of health eects from climate change can only be very approximate. One major study,
by the World Health Organization (WHO), was a quantitative assessment of some of the possible health
impacts that looked at the eects of the climate changes since the mid-1970s and determined that this may
have resulted in over 150,000 deaths in 2000. The study concluded that the eects will probably grow in the
future (World Health Organization, 2009 (p. 48)).
2.5.4.1 Extreme Weather
Climate change can inuence heat-related morbidity and mortality, generally a result of the dierence
between temperature extremes and mean climate in a given area. Higher temperatures in the summer
increase mortality. Studies on the eects of heat waves in Europe indicate that half of the excess heat during
the European heat wave of 2003 was due to global warming and, by inference, about half of the excess deaths
during that heat wave could be attributed to human-generated greenhouse gas emissions (see Haines, Kovats,
Campbell-Lendrum, & Corvalan, 2006 (p. 47); Hellmann, Lesht, & Nadelhoer, 2007 (p. 47); McMichael,
2006 (p. 47)). Urban centers are more susceptible due to the urban heat island eect that produces higher
temperatures in urban areas as compared to the near-by suburbs and rural areas. Lack of vegetation or
evaporation, and large areas of pavement, in cities result in an Urban Heat Island, where urban areas are

warmer than the neighboring suburban and rural areas (See Figure Sketch of an Urban Heat-Island
Prole (Figure 2.14)). Adaptation can help reduce mortality through greater prevention awareness and by
providing more air-conditioning and cooling centers.
Figure 2.14: Sketch of an Urban Heat-Island Prole. Source: Heat Island Group106
.
The reduction of extreme cold due to global warming, could reduce the number of deaths due to low
temperatures. Unlike for heat, those deaths are usually not directly related to the cold temperature itself
but rather to inuenza. Also, deaths related to cold spells would increase to a lesser extent by (1.6%), while
heat waves increase them by 5.7%.
Since volatile organic compounds are precursors of ozone, and VOC emissions increase with temperature, this could lead to an increase in ozone concentrations. For fteen cities in the eastern United States,
the average number of days exceeding the health-based eight-hour ozone standard is projected to increase by
60 percent (from twelve to almost twenty days each summer) by the 2050s because of warmer temperatures
(Lashof, & Patz, 2004 (p. 47)). Pollen levels may increase with increased CO2 levels since that promotes
growth and reproduction in plants. This will increase the incidence of allergic reactions. Similarly, poison
ivy will grow more and be more toxic.
Infectious diseases are inuenced by climate as pathogen survival rates are strongly aected by temperature change. Diseases carried by birds, animals, and insects (vector-born)  such as malaria, dengue
fever, and dengue hemorrhagic fever  may be inuenced by temperature as mosquitoes are sensitive to
climate conditions such as temperature humidity, solar radiation, and rainfall. For example, there has
been a strengthening of the relationship between the El Nino global weather cycle and cholera outbreaks in
Bangladesh. Increases in malaria in the highlands of eastern Africa may be associated with local warming
trends. Temperature also aects the rate of food-born infectious disease. In general, however, it is hard to
isolate the eects of climate change that aect the transmission rate and geographic boundaries of infectious
disease from other social, economic, behavioral, and environmental factors (see McMichael et al., 2006 (p.
47)). Increased precipitation from extreme rainfall events can cause ooding which, especially in cities with
combined sewer and stormwater systems can be contaminated by sewage lines. This can happen when the
deep tunnels that carry stormwater in Chicago reach capacity and untreated sewage then must be released

into Lake Michigan. E. Coli levels in the lake then increase, forcing beaches to close to prevent the spread
of infection.
Diseases are re-emerging and emerging infectious due to intensied food production in factory farms.
Examples include mad cow disease (1980s in Britain); the encroachment on rain forest by pig farmers exposed
pigs and farmers to the Nipah virus carried by rainforest bats that were seeking food from orchards around
the pig farms  driven by deforestation and the drought of El Nino. This caused infection of pigs which lead
to human illness and more than one hundred deaths. Poultry farming (avian inuenza viruses) - crowded
`factory farming' may increase the likelihood of viral virulence when there is no selective advantage in keeping
the host bird alive. Other food related issues are discussed in the next section.
2.5.4.2 Food Production
Climate change can inuence regional famines because droughts and other extreme climate conditions have
a direct inuence on food crops and also by changing the ecology of plant pathogens (Patz et al., 2005 (p.
47)).
There are likely to be major eects of climate change on agricultural production and sheries. This can
be both positive and negative depending on the direct eects of temperature, precipitation, CO2, extreme
climate variations, and sea-level rise. Indirect eects would have to do with changes in soil quality, incidence
of plant diseases and weed and insect populations. Food spoilage will increase with more heat and humidity.
Persistent drought has already reduced food production in Africa. There could be reduction in nutritional
quality due to a reduction in the amount of nitrogen crops incorporate when CO2 levels increase.
Malnutrition will be increased due to drought, particularly poorer countries. Increasing fuel costs also
increase the cost of food, as we are already seeing in 2011. Again, this incremental cost rise aects those who
already spend a large portion of their income on food and can contribute to malnutrition. About one-third,
or 1.7 billion, of all people live in water-stressed countries and this is anticipated to increase to ve billion
by 2025. Frequency of diarrhea and other diseases like conjunctivitis that are associated with poor hygiene
and a breakdown in sanitation may increase.

Figure 2.15: Projection for Future EHW-like Summers in Chicago. The average number of
summers per decade with mortality rates projected to equal those of the Chicago analog to the European
Heat Wave of 2003. Values shown are the average of three climate models for higher (orange) and lower
(yellow) emission scenarios for each decade from 1980 to 2090 Source: Hellmann et al., 2007 (p. 47).
Various studies suggest that increases in population at risk from malnutrition will increase from 40-300
million people over the current 640 million by 2060 (Rosenzweig, Parry, Fischer & Frohberg, 1993 (p. 47)).
A more recent study said that today 34% of the population is at risk and by 2050 this value would grow to
64-72%. Climate change is associated with decreased pH (acidication) of oceans due to higher CO2 levels.
Over the past 200 years ocean pH has been reduced by 0.1 units and the IPCC predicts a drop of 0.14 to
0.35 units by 2100. This may aect shell-forming organisms and the species that depend on them. There
could be a reduction in plankton due to the North Atlantic Gulf Stream (Pauly & Alder, 2005 (p. 47)).
With already overexploited sh populations, it will be harder for them to recover.
Natural disasters like oods, droughts, wildres, tsunamis, and extreme storms have resulted in millions
of deaths over the past 25 years and negatively aected the lives of many more. Survivors may experience
increased rates of mental health disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Wildres reduce air

quality, increasing particulate matter that provokes cardiac and respiratory problems. Sea level rise will
increase ooding and coastal erosion. Indirect eects of rising sea levels include the inltration of salt water
and could interfere with stormwater drainage and sewage disposal. This could force coastal communities
to migrate and create refugees with health burdens such as overcrowding, homelessness, and competition
for resources. Air pollution is likely to be worse with climate change. It can also lead to mobilization of
dangerous chemicals from storage or remobilize chemicals that are already in the environment.
Specic regional eects have may be more severe. Vulnerable regions include temperate zones predicted
to experience disproportionate warming, areas around the Pacic and Indian Oceans that are currently
subject to variability in rainfall, and large cities where they experience the urban heat island eect (Patz
et al., 2005 (p. 47)). The Chicago area is one urban area where analysis has been performed to determine
the specic health eects that are projected due to climate change (see Figure Projection for Future
EHW-like Summers in Chicago (Figure 2.15)). Those eects are similar to the ones described above.
An evaluation of the reductions in adverse health eects that could be achieved by 2020 in four major
cities with a total population of 45 million found that GHG mitigation would reduce particulate matter and
ozone ambient concentrations by about 10% and avoid some 64,000 premature deaths, 65,000 person-chronic
bronchitis case, and 37 million days of restricted activities (Cifuentes, Borja-Aburto, Gouveia, Thurston
& Davis, 2001 (p. 47)). The cities' ozone levels are estimated to increase under predicted future climatic
conditions, and this eect will be more extreme in cities that already suer from high pollution. The
estimates of elevated ozone levels could mean a 0.11% to 0.27% increase in daily total mortality (Bell et al.,
2007 (p. 47)). Therefore, reduction of GHG emissions, along with actions to mitigate the eects of climate
change are likely to reduce the public health outcomes associated with climate change.
2.5.5 Conclusions
The implications of climate change on public health are broad and vast. The interconnectedness of all of
earth's systems and human health is an area that is a challenge to study; the climate change scenarios are
variable. Public health is directly tied to the human ecosystem that we create through our unsustainable
activities. The deterioration of public health on this planet is perhaps the most important consequence of our
own unsustainable choices. Without good public health outcomes, human life on this planet is threatened
and ultimately our actions could cause signicant changes in human health, well-being and longevity. It is
not the earth that is at stake - it is humanity.

Climate and Global Change
3.1 Climate and Global Change  Chapter Introduction1
Module by: Jonathan Tomkin
The Earth's climate is changing. The scientic consensus is that by altering the composition of the
atmosphere humans are increasing the average temperature of the Earth's surface. This process has already
begun  the planet is measurably warmer than it was at the start of the last century  but scientists predict
the change that will occur over the 21st century will be even greater. This increase will have unpredictable
impacts on weather patterns around the globe. We are all experiencing climate change. Our descendants
will likely experience far more.
This chapter focuses on the science of climate change. We recognize that climate change can be a
controversial subject, and that prescriptions for solutions quickly take on a political character, which can
raise suspicions of bias. Some argue that the climate is too complicated to predict, and others suggest that
natural variations can explain the observed changes in the climate.
These objections have some merit. It should be no surprise that the Earth's climate is a complicated
subject. First, the atmosphere is vast: it extends over 600 km (370 miles) above the ground, and it weighs
over ve quadrillion tons (that's a ve followed by 15 zeros). Second, the atmosphere is a dynamic system,
creating blizzards, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and all the other weather we experience. And it is true that
this dynamic system is largely controlled by natural processes  the Earth's climate has been changing
continually since the atmosphere was produced.
And yet scientists can still condently say that humans are responsible for the current warming. We can
do this because this complicated system obeys underlying principles. In the modules Climate Processes;
External and Internal Controls (Section 3.2) and Milankovitch Cycles and the Climate of the
Quaternary (Section 3.3), we will describe how these principles work, and how they have been observed by
scientists. We can then use these principles to understand how, by producing greenhouse gases, humans are
altering the physical properties of the atmosphere in such a way as to increase its ability to retain heat.
In the module Modern Climate Change (Section 3.4) we show how this theoretical prediction of a
warming world is borne out by ever stronger evidence. Temperatures have been measured, and are shown
to be increasing. These increases in temperatures are signicant and have observable eects on the world:
glaciers are shrinking, sea ice is retreating, sea levels are rising  even cherry blossoms are blooming earlier
in the year.
In the module Climate Projections (Section 3.5), we describe how we can attempt to predict the
climate of the future. This is a doubly dicult problem, as it involves not only physics, but, harder yet,
people. What will today's societies do with the foreknowledge of the consequences of our actions? The
climate has become yet another natural system whose immediate fate is connected to our own. The reader
may nd it either reassuring or frightening that we hold the climate's future in our hands.

3.2 Climate Processes; External and Internal Controls2
3.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• dene both "climate" and "weather" and explain how the two are related
• use the Celsius temperature scale to describe climate and weather
• discuss the role and mechanisms of the major controls on Earth's climate using the concepts of insolation, albedo and greenhouse gases
• identify and describe the mechanisms by which major external and internal changes to the climate
(including solar output variation, volcanoes, biological processes, changes in glacial coverage, and
meteorite impacts) operate
• know that the Earth's climate has changed greatly over its history as a result of changes in insolation,
albedo, and atmospheric composition
• describe the processes that can lead to a "Snowball Earth" using the "positive feedback" concept,
and be able to contrast the climate factors that inuenced this period of Earth's history with others,
including the dominant factors that operated during the Cretaceous
• state the major ways in which carbon dioxide is both added to and removed from the atmosphere, and
be able to describe why levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases can be kept in balance
3.2.2 Introduction
The Earth's climate is continually changing. If we are to understand the current climate and predict the
climate of the future, we need to be able to account for the processes that control the climate. One hundred
million years ago, much of North America was arid and hot, with giant sand dunes common across the
continent's interior. Six hundred and fty million years ago it appears that the same land massalong with
the rest of the globewas covered in a layer of snow and ice. What drives these enormous changes through
Earth's history? If we understand these fundamental processes we can explain why the climate of today may
also change.
In discussing climate in this chapter, we will be using degrees Celsius (oC) as the unit of temperature
measurement.

Figure 3.1: A Thermometer This thermometer shows how the two scales compare for typical atmospheric temperatures. A change of one degree Celsius (1 oC) is equivalent to a change of one and four
fths degrees Fahrenheit (1.8 oF). Source: Michiel1972 at nl.wikipedia.3
The Celsius scale is the standard international unit for temperature that scientists use when discussing
the climate. In the Celsius scale, water freezes at 0 oC and boils at 100 oC. A comfortable room might be
heated to 20 oC (which is equivalent to 68 oF). Temperatures can be converted from the Celsius scale to the
Fahrenheit scale with the following equation:
◦F =

◦C + 32 (3.1)
Weather describes the short term state of the atmosphere. This includes such conditions as wind, air
pressure, precipitation, humidity and temperature. Climate describes the typical, or average, atmospheric

conditions. Weather and climate are dierent as the short term state is always changing but the long-term
average is not. On The 1st of January, 2011, Chicago recorded a high temperature of 6 oC; this is a measure
of the weather. Measurements of climate include the averages of the daily, monthly, and yearly weather
patterns, the seasons, and even a description of how often extraordinary events, such as hurricanes, occur.
So if we consider the average Chicago high temperature for the 1st of January (a colder 0.5 oC) or the
average high temperature for the entire year (a warmer 14.5 oC) we are comparing the city's weather with
its climate. The climate is the average of the weather.
3.2.3 Insolation, Albedo and Greenhouse Gases
What controls the climate? The average temperature of the Earth is about 15 oC (which is the yearly average
temperature for the city of San Francisco), so most of the Earth's water is in a liquid state. The average
temperature of Mars is about -55 oC (about the same as the average winter temperature of the South Pole),
so all of the water on the Martian surface is frozen. This is a big dierence! One reason Earth is so much
hotter than Mars is that Earth is closer to the Sun. Mars receives less than half as much energy from the
Sun per unit area as Earth does. This dierence in insolation, which is the measure of the amount of solar
radiation falling on a surface, is a very important factor in determining the climate of the Earth.
On Earth, we notice the eects of varying insolation on our climate. Sunlight falls most directly on the
equator, and only obliquely (at an angle) on the poles. This means that the sunlight is more concentrated at
the equator. As shown in Figure Insolation Angle (Figure 3.2), the same amount of sunlight covers twice
as much area when it strikes a surface at an angle of 30o
compared to when it strikes a surface directly: the
same energy is spread more thinly, weakening its ability to warm the Earth.
Figure 3.2: Insolation Angle Insolation is the eect of incidence angle on sunlight intensity. Note that
the same amount of sunlight is spread out over twice the area when it strikes the surface at a 30-degree
angle. Source: Wikipedia4

53
As a consequence, the tropics receive about twice the insolation as the area inside the Arctic Circle 
see Figure Insolation Comparison (Figure 3.3). This dierence in energy explains why the equator has a
hot climate and the poles have a cold climate. Dierences in insolation also explain the existence of seasons.
The Earth's axis is tilted at 23o
compared to its orbit, and so over the course of the year each hemisphere
alternates between directly facing the Sun and obliquely facing the Sun. When the Northern hemisphere is
most directly facing the Sun (the months of May, June and July) insolation is thus higher, and the climate
is warmer. This variation in insolation explains why summer and winter occur (we get less energy from the
Sun in winter then we do in summer), and why the timing of the seasons is opposite in the Southern and
Northern hemispheres.
Figure 3.3: Insolation Comparison A cartoon of how latitude is important in determining the
amount of insolation. The same amount of sunlight (yellow bars) is spread out over twice the planet's
surface area when the rays strike the Earth at an angle (compare the length of the dark lines at the
equator and at the poles). Source: Jonathan H. Tomkin.5
Figure Insolation (Figure 3.4) shows both the equatorial and seasonal impacts of insolation. High levels
of insolation are shown in warm colors (red and pink) and low levels of insolation are shown in cold colors
(blue). Notice that in January (top map) the maximum levels of insolation are in the Southern Hemisphere,
as this is when the Southern Hemisphere is most directly facing the sun. The Arctic receives very little
insolation at this time of year, as it experiences its long polar night. The reverse is true in April (bottom
map).

The level of insolation aecting Earth depends on the amount of light (or solar radiation) emitted by
the Sun. Over the current geologic period, this is very slowly changingsolar radiation is increasing at a
rate of around 10% every billion years. This change is much too slow to be noticeable to humans. The sun
also goes through an 11-year solar cycle, in which the amount of solar radiation increases and decreases. At
the solar cycle peak, the total solar radiation is about 0.1% higher than it is at the trough.
The Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular, so sometimes the Earth is closer to or further from the Sun
than it is on average. This also changes the amount of insolation, as the closer the Earth is to the Sun the
more concentrated the solar radiation. As we shall see in the next section, these orbital variations have made
a big dierence in conditions on the Earth during the period in which humans have inhabited it.
In addition to considering how much energy enters the Earth system via insolation, we also need to
consider how much energy leaves. The climate of the Earth is controlled by the Earth's energy balance,
which is the movement of energy into and out of the Earth system. Energy ows into the Earth from
the Sun and ows out when it is radiated into space. The Earth's energy balance is determined by the
amount of sunlight that shines on the Earth (the insolation) and the characteristics of the Earth's surface
and atmosphere that act to reect, circulate and re-radiate this energy. The more energy in the system the
higher the temperature, so either increasing the amount of energy arriving or decreasing the rate at which
it leaves would make the climate hotter.
One way to change how quickly energy exits the Earth system is to change the reectivity of the surface. Compare the dierence in dark surface of tilled soil (Figure Reectivity of Earth's Surface (a)
(Figure 3.6(a))) with the blinding brightness of snow-covered ice (Figure Reectivity of Earth's Surface
(b) (Figure 3.6(b))).

The dark soil is absorbing the sun's rays and in so doing is heating the Earth surface, while the brilliant
snow is reecting the sunlight back into space. Albedo is a measure of how reective a surface is. The higher
the albedo the more reective the material: a perfectly black surface has zero albedo, while a perfectly white
surface has an albedo of 1 - it reects 100% of the incident light. If a planet has a high albedo, much of the
radiation from the Sun is reected back into space, lowering the average temperature. Today, Earth has an
average albedo of just over 30%, but this value depends on how much cloud cover there is and what covers
the surface. Covering soil with grass increases the amount of light reected from 17% to 25%, while adding
a layer of fresh snow can increase the amount reected to over 80%. Figure Surface of Earth with Cloud
Cover Removed (Figure 3.7) is a composite photograph of the Earth with the cloud cover removed. As
you can see, forests and oceans are dark (low albedo) while snow and deserts are bright (high albedo).

Changes in albedo can create a positive feedback that reinforces a change in the climate. A positive
feedback is a process which amplies the eect of an initial change. If the climate cools, (the initial change),
snow covers more of the surface of the land, and sea-ice covers more of the oceans. Because snow has a higher
albedo than bare ground, and ice has a higher albedo than water, this initial cooling increases the amount of
sunlight that is reected back into space, cooling the Earth further (the amplication, or positive feedback).
Compare the brightness of Figure Surface of Earth with Cloud Cover Removed (Figure 3.7) with a
similar photo montage from February (Figure Surface of the Earth in February with Cloud Cover
Removed (Figure 3.8)): the extra snow has increased the Earth's albedo. Imagine what would happen if
the Earth produced even more snow and ice as a result of this further cooling. The Earth would then reect
more sunlight into space, cooling the planet further and producing yet more snow. If such a loop continued
for long enough, this process could result in the entire Earth being covered in ice! Such a feedback loop is
known as the Snowball Earth hypothesis, and scientists have found much supporting geological evidence.
The most recent period in Earth's history when this could have occurred was around 650 Million years ago.
Positive feedbacks are often described as "runaway" processes; once they are begun they continue without
stopping.

Albedo does not explain everything, however. The Earth and the Moon both receive the same amount of
insolation. Although the Moon is only slightly more reective than the Earth, it is much colder. The average
temperature on Earth is 15 oC, while the Moon's average temperature is -23 oC. Why the dierence? A
planet's energy balance is also regulated by its atmosphere. A thick atmosphere can act to trap the energy
from sunlight, preventing it from escaping directly into space. Earth has an atmosphere while the Moon
does not. If the Earth did not have an atmosphere, it would have an average temperature of -18 oC; slightly
warmer than the Moon since it has a lower albedo.
How does the atmosphere trap the energy from the Sun? Shouldn't the Earth's atmosphere reect as
much incoming radiation as it traps? It is true the atmosphere reects incoming solar radiationin fact,
only around half the insolation that strikes the top of the atmosphere reaches the Earth's surface. The reason
an atmosphere generally acts to warm a planet is that the nature of light radiation changes as it reaches the
planet's surface. Atmospheres trap more light than they reect.
Humans see the Earth's atmosphere as largely transparent; that is, we can see a long way in air. This is
because we see light in the visible spectrum, which is the light radiation in the range of wavelengths the
human eye is able to perceive, and visible light is able to travel a long way through the Earth's atmosphere
before it is absorbed. Light is also transmitted in wavelengths we can't see, such as in the infrared spectrum, which is sometimes referred to as infrared light, heat, or thermal radiation. Compared to visible light,
infrared light cannot travel very far in the Earth's atmosphere before it is absorbed. Solar radiation striking
the Earth is largely in the visible part of the spectrum. The surface of the Earth absorbs this energy and
re-radiates it largely in the infrared part of the spectrum. This means that solar radiation enters the Earth
in the form of visible light, unhindered, but tries to leave in the form of infrared light, which is trapped.
Thicker atmospheres keep this infrared radiation trapped for longer, and so warm the Earthjust like an
extra blanket makes you warmer in bed.
This eect is shown in Figure Earth Atmosphere Cartoon (Figure 3.9). The visible light radiation
enters the atmosphere, and quickly exits as infrared radiation if there is no atmosphere (top Earth). With

our atmosphere (the middle Earth), visible light enters unhindered but the infrared light is partially reected
back to the surface, increasing the amount of energy and thus the temperature at the Earth's surface. If the
atmosphere is made thicker (bottom Earth) the infrared radiation is trapped for longer, further warming the
planet's surface.

radiation emitted by the sun (yellow arrows) strikes the Earth and reects as infrared radiation (orange
arrow); (middle) an atmosphere reects some of the infrared radiation back toward the planet; (bottom)
a thickened atmosphere reects greater amounts of infrared radiation. Source: Jonathan H. Tomkin.12
The way the atmosphere acts to trap light radiation is referred to as the greenhouse eect, and the
gases that prevent the thermal radiation from exiting the Earth system are described as greenhouse gases.
The four most important greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide,
methane, and ozone. All four are found naturally in the Earth's atmosphere. As we will discuss in Section
4.4, however, human activities are adding to the natural amount of carbon dioxide and methane, and even
adding new greenhouse gases, such as chlorouorocarbon (CFC).
3.2.4 Earth's Changing Atmosphere
The composition of Earth's atmosphere has changed over geologic time. The atmosphere has largely come
from volcanic venting of gas from Earth's interior (see Figure Volcanic Outgassing (Figure 3.10)), but
biology has also made important changes by producing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. Greenhouse
gases currently make up only a small fraction of the Earth's atmosphere99% of air consists of nitrogen
and oxygen molecules.

atmosphere. Source: Jan-Pieter Nap, taken on July 11, 2004.13
While volcanoes can warm the Earth by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, which produces a
greenhouse eect, they can also cool the Earth by injecting ash and sulfur into the atmosphere. These
additions raise the albedo of the atmosphere, allowing less sunlight to reach the surface of the Earth. The
eect lasts until the particles settle out of the atmosphere, typically within a few years. Volcanic eruptions
have impacted human societies throughout history; the Mt. Tambora eruption in 1815 cooled the Earth so
much that snow fell during June in New England, and the more recent Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 (see
Figure Mt. Pinatubo Explosion (Figure 3.11)) ejected so much sulfuric acid into the atmosphere that
global temperatures were lowered by about 0.5 oC in the following year.

Survey photograph, by Richard P. Hoblitt.14
Evidence from the geologic past indicates that similar events have caused mass extinctions wherein a
signicant fraction of all species on Earth were wiped out in a relatively short amount of time. Sustained
outgassing from continuous volcanic eruptions is thought to have produced so much ash and aerosols that
light sucient to support photosynthesis in plants was unable to penetrate the atmosphere, causing the food
chain to collapse. The ash particles produced by extended eruptions would also have increased the Earth's
albedo, making conditions inhospitably cool for plants and animals adapted to a warmer environment.

62 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
Asteroid impacts can also cause the climate to suddenly cool. When large asteroids strike the Earth,
ash is ejected into the atmosphere, which increases albedo in the same way as volcanic eruptions. Everyday
clouds (made up of water droplets) both cool and warm the Earth. They can cool the Earth by increasing
the planet's albedo, reecting sunlight into space before it reaches the surface. Clouds can also warm the
Earth, by reecting infrared radiation emitted by the surface back towards the planet. Dierent types of
clouds, and dierent conditions, determine which eect predominates. On a hot summer's day, for example,
clouds cool us by shielding us from the sun's rays, but on a winter's night a layer of cloud can act as a
warming blanket.
The composition of the Earth's atmosphere is not xed; greenhouse gases can be added to and removed
from the atmosphere over time. For example, carbon dioxide is added by volcanoes and the decay or burning
of organic matter. It is removed by photosynthesis in plants, when it is dissolved in the oceans and when
carbonate sediments (a type of rock) are produced. Over geologic time, these processes have signicantly
reduced the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels just prior
to the industrial revolution are thought to have been only one twentieth of those of 500 million years ago.
Natural processes also remove carbon dioxide added by human activity, but only very slowly. It is estimated
that it would take the Earth around a thousand years to naturally remove most of the carbon dioxide released
by the industrial consumption of fossil fuels up to the present.
Greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide are shorter-lived: methane is removed from the atmosphere
in around a decade, and chlorouorocarbons break down within a century. Individual water molecules spend
only a few days at a time in the atmosphere, but unlike the other greenhouse gases, the total amount of
water vapor in the atmosphere remains constant. Water evaporated from the oceans replaces water lost by
condensation and precipitation.
Changing the composition of the Earth's atmosphere also changes the climate. Do you remember the
Snowball Earth (p. 57)  how increasing ice cover also increased the Earth's albedo, eventually covering the
entire planet in ice and snow? Today's climate is temperateso we must have escaped this frozen trap. But
how? The leading hypothesis is that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere changed, with volcanoes
slowly adding more and more carbon dioxide to it. Without access to the oceans, plants, or surface rocks,
this carbon dioxide was not removed from the atmosphere and so continued to build up over millions of
years. Eventually, the additional warming caused by the increase in greenhouse gases overcame the cooling
caused by the snow's high albedo, and temperatures rose enough to melt the ice, freeing the Earth.
For most of Earth's history, carbon dioxide concentrations have been higher than they are today. As
a consequence, past climates have often been very warm. During the late stage of the dinosaur era (the
Cretaceous, a period that lasted between 65 and 145 million years ago), carbon dioxide levels were about
5 times higher than they are today, and the average global temperatures were more than 10 oC higher than
today's. There were no large ice sheets, and dinosaur fossils from this period have been found as far north
as Alaska. These animals would not survive the cold conditions found in the arctic today. Further south,
fossil crocodiles from 60 million years ago have been found in North Dakota. The modern average winter
temperature in North Dakota is around -10 oC but being cold-blooded, crocodiles are most at home when
the air temperature is around 30 oC! The climate was warmer in the past when the amount of carbon dioxide
was higher.
3.2.5 Review Questions
Question 3.2.1
The text describes how the high albedo of snow acts as a positive feedbackif the Earth is made
cooler, the highly reective snow can act to further cool the Earth. Today, part of the Earth is
covered with snow and ice. Can you describe a mechanism by which warmer temperatures would
also produce a positive feedbackthis time heating the Earth furtherthrough a similar albedo
mechanism?
Question 3.2.2
Mars is colder than the Earth. Venus, on the other hand, is much hotter, with average surface
Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11325/1.45>
63
temperatures of around 450 oC. Venus is closer to the Sun than the Earth is, and so receives about
twice as much solar radiation. Venus's atmosphere is also dierent than Earth's, as it is much thicker
and mainly consists of carbon dioxide. Using the terms insolation and greenhouse gases, can
you suggest reasons why Venus is so hot?
Question 3.2.3
Oxygen makes up over 20% of Earth's atmosphere, while carbon dioxide makes up less than 0.04%.
Oxygen is largely transparent to both visible and infrared light. Explain why carbon dioxide is a
more important greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere than oxygen, even though there is much
more oxygen than carbon dioxide.
Question 3.2.4
Figure Insolation (Figure 3.4) shows the insolation at the surface of the Earth. The Earth is
spherical, so we would expect the values to be the same for places of the same latitude. But notice
that this is not true  compare, for example, central Africa with the Atlantic Ocean at the same
latitude. What feature of the atmosphere might explain this variation, and why?

3.3.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• describe the changing climate of the Quaternary
• explain why Milankovitch cycles explain the variations of climate over the Quaternary, in terms of the
similar periods of orbital variations and glacial cycles
• explain how the glacier/climate system is linked via albedo feedbacks

on stable isotope records
3.3.2 Introduction
In Module Climate Processes; External and Internal Controls (Section 3.2) we saw the major drivers
of the climatethe energy that comes from the Sun (insolation) and the properties of the planet that
determine how long that energy stays in the Earth system (albedo, greenhouse gases). In this section, we
will look at the recent natural changes in Earth's climate, and we will use these drivers to understand why
the climate has changed.

64 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
The most recent period of Earth's geologic historyspanning the last 2.6 million yearsis known as the
Quaternary period. This is an important period for us because it encompasses the entire period over
which humans have existedour species evolved about 200,000 years ago. We will examine how the climate
has changed over this period in detail. By understanding recent natural processes of climate change, we will
be able to better understand why scientists attribute the currently observed changes in global climate as
being the result of human activity.
3.3.3 Quaternary Climate  Information From Ice Cores
How do we know about the Quaternary climate? After all, most of the period predates human existence,
and we have only been recording the conditions of climate for a few centuries. Scientists are able to make
informed judgments about the climates of the deep past by using proxy data. Proxy data is information
about the climate that accumulates through natural phenomena. In the previous module, for example, we
discussed how 60-million-year-old crocodile fossils have been found in North Dakota. This gives us indirect
information about the climate of the periodthat the climate of the region was warmer than it is today.
Although not as precise as climate data recorded by instruments (such as thermometers), proxy data has
been recovered from a diverse array of natural sources, and provides a surprisingly precise picture of climate
change through deep time.
One highly detailed record of past climate conditions has been recovered from the great ice sheets of
Greenland and Antarctica. These ice sheets are built by snow falling on the ice surface and being covered by
subsequent snowfalls. The compressed snow is transformed into ice. It is so cold in these polar locations that
the ice doesn't melt even in the summers, so the ice is able to build up over hundreds of thousands of years.
Because the ice at lower depths was produced by progressively earlier snowfalls, the age of the ice increases
with depth, and the youngest ice is at the surface. The Antarctic ice sheet is up to three miles thick. It
takes a long time to build up this much ice, and the oldest ice found at the bottom of the Antarctica ice
sheet is around 800,000 years old.
Scientists drill into these ice sheets to extract ice cores, which record information about past climates.
Figure Ice Cores (Figure 3.12) shows what these cores look like when they are cut open. Like tree rings, ice
cores indicate years of growth. Note how the middle core (which required over a mile of drilling to extract!)
has distinct layersthis is because the seasons leave an imprint in the layers of snow. Scientists can use
this imprint to help calculate the age of the ice at dierent depths, although the task becomes more dicult
the deeper the core sample, since the ice layers become more compressed. The ice records several dierent
types of climate information: the temperature of the core, the properties of the water that make up the ice,
trapped dust, and tiny entombed bubbles of ancient atmosphere.

the middle section (note the dark and light bands). The deepest section (bottom core) is taken from
almost two miles down and is colored brown by rocky debris from the ground under the ice. Source:
National Ice Core Laboratory18
The water molecules that make up the ice record information about the temperature of the atmosphere.
Each water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (and so has the chemical
name H2O). Not all oxygen atoms are the same however; some are "light" and some are "heavy". These
dierent types of oxygen are called isotopes, which are atoms that have same number of protons but
dierent numbers of neutrons. The heavy isotope of oxygen (oxygen-18, or 18O) is more than 10% heavier
than the light isotope (oxygen-16 or 16O). This means that some water molecules weigh more than others.
This is important because lighter water molecules are more easily evaporated from the ocean, and once in
the atmosphere, heavier water molecules are more likely to condense and fall as precipitation. As we can see
from Figure Oxygen Schematic (Figure 3.13), the water in the ice sheets is lighter (has a higher proportion
of 16O relative to 18O) than the water in the oceans.
The process of dierentiation between heavy and light water molecules is temperature dependent. If
the atmosphere is warm, there is more energy available to evaporate and hold the heavier 18O water in the
atmosphere, so the snow that falls on the polar ice sheets is relatively higher in 18O. When the atmosphere is
cold, the amount of energy is less, and so less 18O makes it to the poles to be turned into glacial ice. We can
compare the amount of 18O in dierent parts of the ice core to see how the atmosphere's temperaturethe
climatehas changed.

(18O) water drops out of the atmosphere (as rain or snow) before reaching the ice sheet. This means that
the snow that forms the glacial ice is lighter than the ocean water (has more 16O than 18O, compared
to ocean water). Source: Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC, NASA Earth Observatory19
Figure Ice Age Temperature (Figure 3.14) shows what this record looks like over the last 400,000
years. The blue and green lines depict two dierent Antarctic ice cores (taken from ice about 350 miles
apart) and the variations in oxygen isotopes are converted into temperature changes. The y-axis shows
temperature change; today's climate is at zerothe dashed line. Notice that the Earth's climate has not
been stable! Sometimes the temperature is higher than it is todaythe blue and green lines are higher than
the dashed about 120,000 years ago, for example. Most of the time the climate is much colder than today's,
however: the most common value is around -6 oC (-13 oF). On average, the earth's temperature between
25,000 and 100,000 years ago was about 6 oC lower than it is today. These changes can be double-checked
by measuring the temperature of the ice in the cores directly. Ice that is 30,000 years old is indeed colder
than the ice made today, just as the isotope data predicts.

is highly variable. In the last one million years the climate alternates between warm and cool conditions
on a 100,000-year time scale ("100 kyr cycle"), before this it alternated on a 41,000 year cycle. Both
these period lengths are the same as Milankovitch cycles. These cores suggest that today's temperature
is higher than almost all of that of the Quaternary (the last 2.6 Million years). Source: Jo Weber21
The changes in climate recorded in ice sheets are thought to be worldwide. The same climate changes
observed in Antarctica are also found in cores taken from Greenland, which is on the other side of the Earth.
Isotope data can also be taken from sediment cored from the ocean oorall over the planetand these
cores also show the same changes in climate, alternating between cold and warm. Because ocean sediment is
deposited over millions of years, the sediment can give an indication of the climate across the whole of the
Quaternary and beyond. Figure Five Myr Climate Change (Figure 3.15) shows how temperature has
changed over time (blue line), compared with today (dashed line). The temperature has, on average, gotten
colder over the Quaternary, but it also appears to oscillate between warm and cold periods. We'll investigate
these periodic changes in the next section of this chapter.
As falling snow accumulates on the ground, tiny bubbles of air become trapped in it. These bubbles are
retained as the snow transforms to ice, and constitute tiny samples of the ancient atmosphere that can be
analyzed to nd out if the changes in temperature (as recorded in the oxygen isotopes) are related to changes
in the atmosphere. The temperature recorded by the isotopes in the ice is directly related to the amount of
carbon dioxide in the trapped air (Figure Vostok Petit Data (Figure 3.16)): the times with higher carbon
dioxide are also times of high temperature.
Falling snow also captures and entombs atmospheric dust, which is topsoil born aloft by the wind, and
which is especially prevalent during droughts. The fact that more dust occurs in the ice accumulated during
cold periods suggests that the glacial climate was dry, as well as cold.

During the Quaternary, the Earth has cycled between glacial periods (sometimes referred to as "ice ages")
and interglacial periods. The ice was at its most recent extreme around 20,000 years ago in a period known
as the Last Glacial Maximum, or LGM. As we can see from the ice core record, the Quaternary climate is
usually cold (see Figure Ice Age Temperature (Figure 3.14)), with long periods of cold punctuated with
shorter (10,000 year long, or so) periods of warmer conditions, like those we experience today. In many ways,
our current climate is exceptionalfor most of human existence, the Earth has been a much colder place.
What was the Earth like during these glacial periods? Almost all the world was cold; average temperatures
were around 6 oC (-13 oF) colder than today. Such conditions allow ice sheets to growmuch of North
America, Asia and Europe were covered under mile-thick ice (see Figure Ice Age Earth (Figure 3.17)).
Because this ice was made of water that was once in the oceans, sea levels were much lower. At the LGM, sea
level was about 120 meters (or about 400 feet) lower than it is today. As the seas retreated, the continents
grew larger, creating land bridges that joined Asia with North America, Britain with Europe, and Australia
with Papua New Guinea.

During glacial periods the climate was also much drier, as evidenced by the increase in atmospheric dust
(Figure Vostok Petit Data (Figure 3.16)). The lands at and near the poles were covered with ice, and
dry grasslands occupied areas where temperate forests occur today. Deserts were much larger than they are
now, and tropical rainforests, having less water and less warmth, were small. The animals and plants of
glacial periods were dierent in their distribution than they are today, as they were adapted to these dierent
conditions. Fossils of Mastodons (Figure Knight Mastodon (Figure 3.18)) have been found from all across
what is now the United States, including from Florida, which currently enjoys a subtropical climate.

a thick wooly coat. Mastodon fossils dating from past glacial periods have been found across North
Americafrom Florida to Alaska. Source: Charles R. Knight24
During glacial periods humans would have been unable to occupy the globe as they do today because
all landmasses experienced dierent climactic conditions. Some countries of the present could not exist, as
they would be almost completely covered by ice. As examples, look for Canada, Iceland and The United
Kingdom in Figure 800pn Northern Icesheet (Figure 3.20).
3.3.5 Milankovitch Cycles
Why has the Earth cycled through hot and cold climates throughout the Quaternary? As we learned in the
previous module, the Earth's climate is controlled by several dierent factorsinsolation, greenhouse gases,
and albedo are all important. Scientists believe that changes in insolation are responsible for these climate
swings, and the insolation varies as a result of wobbles in the Earth's orbit.
The Earth's orbit is not xed  it changes regularly over time. These periodic changes in Earth's
orbit named are referred to as Milankovitch Cycles, and are illustrated in Figure Milankovitch Cycles
(Figure 3.19). Changes in the Earth's orbit alter the pattern of insolation that the Earth receives. There
are three principle ways in which the Earth's orbit varies:

72 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
Eccentricity (or Orbital shape). The Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular, but instead follows an
ellipse. This means that the Earth is, through the course of the year, sometimes closer and sometimes
further away from the Sun. Currently, the Earth is closest to the Sun in early January, and furthest
from the Sun in Early July. This changes the amount of insolation by a few percent, so Northern
Hemisphere seasons are slightly milder than they would be if the orbital was circular (cooler summers
and warmer winters). The orbital shape changes over time: the Earth moves between being nearly
circular and being mildly elliptical. There are two main periods over which this change occurs, one
takes around 100,000 years (this is the time over which the orbit goes from being circular, to elliptic,
and back to circular), another takes around 400,000 years.
2. Axial Tilt (or Obliquity). The Earth axis spins at an angle to its orbit around the Sun  currently
this angle is 23.5 degrees (this angle is known as the axial tilt). This dierence in orbit creates the
seasons (as each hemisphere takes turns being tilted towards and away from the Sun over the course
of the year). If the axis of spin lined up with the direction of the Earth's orbit (so that the tilt angle
was zero) there would be no seasons! This axial tilt also changes over time, varying between 22.1 and
24.5 degrees. The larger the angle, the larger the temperature dierence between summer and winter.
It takes about 41,000 year for the axial tilt to change from one extreme to the other, and back again.
Currently, the axial tilt is midway between the two extremes and is decreasingwhich will make the
seasons weaker (cooler summers and warmer winters) over the next 20,000 years.
3. Axial Precession. The direction of Earth's axis of rotation also changes over time relative to the
stars. Currently, the North Pole points towards the star Polaris, but the axis of rotation cycles between
pointing to that star and the star Vega. This impacts the Earth's climate as it determines when the
seasons occur in Earth's orbit. When the axis is pointing at Vega, the Northern Hemisphere's peak
summer is in January, not July. If this were true today, it would mean that the Northern Hemisphere
would experience more extreme seasons, because January is when the Earth is closest to the Sun (as
discussed above in eccentricity). This cycle takes around 20,000 years to complete.

The three cycles described above have dierent periods, all of which are long by human standards:
20,000, 40,000, 100,000 and 400,000 years. If we look at the temperature data from ice and sediment cores,
we see that these periods are reected in Earth's climate. In the last million or so years, the 100,000-year
eccentricity in the orbit has determined the timing of glaciations, and before that the 40,000-year axial tilt
was dominant (Figure Five Myr Climate Change (Figure 3.15)). These cycles have been important for
a long time; geologists have even found evidence of these periods in rocks that are hundreds of millions of
years old.
But how do the Milankovitch Cycles change our climate? These orbital cycles do not have much impact
on the total insolation the Earth receives: they change only the timing of that insolation. Since the total
insolation does not change, these orbital variations have the power to make the Earth's seasons stronger
or weaker, but the average annual temperature should stay the same. The best explanation for long term
changes in average annual temperature is that the Milankovitch cycles initiate a positive feedback that
amplies the small change in insolation.

74 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
3.3.6 Insolation and the Albedo Feedback
Today, the Earth's orbit is not very eccentric (it is almost circular), but at the beginning of each of the
recent ice age periods, the orbit was much more elliptical. This meant that the Earth was further away from
the sun during the northern hemisphere summers, reducing the total insolation. Lower insolation meant
that the summer months were milder than they would otherwise be, with cooler temperatures. Summer
temperatures were also lower when the Earth's axial tilt was smaller, so the two dierent orbital parameters
could reinforce one another's eects, in this case producing especially mild summers.
It is thought that these mild northern summers produced an albedo feedback that made the whole
planet slip into an ice age. The northern hemisphere has continents near the polesEurope, Asia, and
North America. Today, these continents have largely temperate climates. During the winter, snow falls
across much of the land (see Figure Surface of the Earth in February with Cloud Cover Removed
(Figure 3.8) in the previous module) only to melt during the summer months. If the summers are not hot
enough to melt all the snow and ice, glaciers can advance, covering more of the land. Because ice has a
high albedo, more sunlight is reected than before, and the Earth is made cooler. This creates a positive
feedback, as the cooler conditions allow the ice to advance furtherwhich, in turn, increases the albedo and
cools the Earth! Eventually, a large proportion of the northern continents became covered in ice (Figure
800pn Northern Icesheet (Figure 3.20)).

during the ice ages. Source: Hannes Grobe26

75
This positive feedback process works in the other direction, as well. The interglacial periods are ushered
in when the orbital parameters create summers that are unusually warm, which melts some of the ice. When
the ice sheets shrink, the Earth's albedo decreases, which further warms the system. The giant northern ice
sheets shriveled up in a few thousand years as warm summers and decreasing albedo worked together.
These cycles of alternating cooling and warming are also related to changes in the amount of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. As we observed in Figure Vostok Petit Data (Figure 3.16), the climate contains
higher levels of carbon dioxide during interglacial periods. Although this appears to make sensecarbon
dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and so should produce warmer climatesit is also a puzzle, because it is not clear
how changes in Milankovitch cycles lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is clear that
these changes in carbon dioxide are important in making the change in temperature between interglacial and
glacial periods so extreme. Several dierent hypotheses have been proposed to explain why glacial periods
produce lower levels of carbon dioxide (it may be related to how the physical changes inuence the Earth's
ecosystems ability to absorb carbon dioxide: perhaps lower sea levels increase the nutrient supply in the
ocean, or the drop in sea level destroys coral reefs, or iron-rich dust from new deserts fertilizes the oceans)
but further work on this question remains to be done.
It is a concern for all of us that there are gaps in our understanding of how the feedbacks between
insolation, albedo and greenhouse gases operate, as it makes it hard to predict what the consequences
of any changes in the climate system might lead to. The current level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is
unprecedented in human experience; it is at the highest level ever recorded in the Quaternary. Will the
current increase in greenhouse gases lead to a positive feedback, warming the Earth even more?
3.3.7 Review Questions
Question 3.3.1
In the text, we discuss how polar ice has a smaller 18O to 16O ratio (that is, it has proportionally
less heavy isotope water) than ocean water does. Hydrogen also has isotopes, the two most common
being hydrogen-1 (1H) and hydrogen-2 (2H, also known as deuterium). Water is made up of both
hydrogen and oxygen, and scientists analyze both elements when examining ice cores. Do you
predict that polar ice sheets would have a higher ratio or a lower ratio of 1H to 2H than ocean
water? Will colder global temperatures increase or decrease the amount of 2H in polar ice?
Question 3.3.2
In the text, we discuss how polar ice has a smaller 18O to 16O ratio (that is, it has proportionally
less heavy-isotope water) when the climate is cooler. We also discuss how changes in the ratio of
18O to 16O ratio in sediment cores can also be used to determine the climate's average temperature.
In ocean sediments, the ratio of 18O to 16O increases when the climate is cooler (that is, it has
proportionally more heavy isotope water). Explain why isotope ratios in ocean sediment have the
opposite reaction to those in polar ice.
Question 3.3.3
There are three dierent ways in which the Earth's orbit changes through time. What combination
of orbital parameters would be most likely to start an ice age? (Hint: Ice ages require cool northern
summers.)
3.3.8 Resources
Do you want to know more about how ice cores are extracted and analyzed? NASA's Earth Observatory
has details about the practical issues of drilling ice cores (deep ice needs to "relax" for as long as a year
at the surface before being cut open  or it can shatter!) and how chemical data is interpreted. Go to

3.4 Modern Climate Change28
3.4.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• assess long-term global temperature records and place recent climate change into the context of historical temperature observations
• explain how changes in the Sun's energy output have impacted the last 1300 years of global temperature
records
• analyze the human impact on the planetary albedo and relate these changes to recent climate change
• predict the response of the global average temperature when large volcanic eruptions occur
• explain the enhanced greenhouse eect
• discuss how recent observations of change measured within regional ecosystems are related to global
climate change
3.4.2 Introduction
In previous modules, an examination of the geologic record of the earth's climate in the Quaternary Period
revealed the primary drivers of climate change. The most important conclusions to be drawn from the
Modules Climate Processes; External and Internal Controls (Section 3.2) and Milankovitch Cycles
and the Climate of the Quaternary (Section 3.3) are the following:
1. In the past, Earth has been signicantly warmer (and mostly ice free) and signicantly colder (especially
during the so-called Snowball Earth eras) than it is today.
2. Climate change occurs when there are changes in insolation, albedo, and composition of the atmosphere.
3. Climate is the average of weather, and changes to the earth's climate occur on long time scales.
Recent climate change, which has occurred during the modern instrument era, is the focus of this module.
It is through the lens of long-term climate change (occurring on thousands to millions of years) that we will
view earth's current climate and recent climate change. The goal is to investigate how the principles listed
above are shaping current climate events.
3.4.3 Mechanisms
3.4.3.1 Temperature Records
Figure Northern Hemisphere Surface Air (Figure 3.21) clearly shows that the current global average
temperature reects an interglacial warm period. If we focus in on the end of this record we can observe
some of the ne scale changes in the global temperature records. Figure Northern Hemisphere Surface
Air (Figure 3.21) combines proxy data (i.e., information from ice cores and tree rings) with the modern
instrument record to create a graph showing the last 1300 years of Northern Hemisphere (hereafter, NH)
temperatures. Each line on the top two panels represents a dierent temperature data set collected in the
NH and the bottom panel color codes the percentage of overlap among these data sets.

78 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
Major features in these data include the Medieval Warm Period approximately 1,000 years ago and
the Little Ice Age approximately 400 years ago. Even with these events, the bottom panel shows that most
of the variability in the NH temperature ts within a 0.5 ◦C temperature range. Rarely has the temperature
exceeded the 1961-1990 average, which is the dividing line on this graph. The only major uctuation outside
of this range is during the modern instrument era of the last 300 years, where condence between the data
sets is high. Beginning in the 1800s, the solid black line in each panel traces out approximately a 1 ◦C
increase in global temperatures. It is this increase that is the central focus in recent climate change science.
Remember from the previous chapter that a 1 ◦C change in the earth's temperature is a large change; reduce
the global average by 4 ◦C to 6 ◦C and much of the NH will be covered with ice as it was 20,000 years ago.
There has been much debate over recent climate change, especially in the news media and among political
parties around the world. This debate is centered on the cause of the recent 1 ◦C increaseis it a part of
the natural variability in the climate system or have anthropogenic, which simply means human caused,
inuences played a major role? In a recent survey given to more than 3,000 college students at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it was found the approximately two thirds of those surveyed agreed that
recent climate change was due to reasons beyond natural variability in the climate system. (see Figure
Recent Climate Change Student Responses (Figure 3.22)) Approximately 20% reported that the
climate change is due to natural changes and the remainder was undecided. Let's investigate both sides of
this argument!
Figure 3.22: Recent Climate Change Student Responses Survey results from 3,000+ college
students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign when asked if climate was changing beyond
natural variability. Source: Snodgrass, E.30
Recall from the Module Milankovitch Cycles and the Climate of the Quaternary (Section 3.3) that global
climate will change as a response to changes in insolation, albedo and the composition of the atmosphere.
It was shown that the amount of energy entering the earth-atmosphere system from the sun varies less than
0.1% during the 11-year solar cycle in sunspot activity. Outside of this cycle, the amount of energy from
the sun has increased 0.12 Watts per square meter (W/m2
) since 1750. Is this enough excess energy to

79
produce the 1 ◦C increase in global temperatures that has been observed since the 1800s? As it turns out,
the climate system needs nearly 8 times that amount of energy to warm by 1 ◦C. This essentially eliminates
uctuations in solar output as the culprit for recent climate change.
Has the earth's albedo changed since the 1800s? As we know from the Module Climate Processes;
External and Internal Controls (Section 3.2), increases in the Earth's albedo lead to global cooling
and decreases lead to warming. The net eect of human existence on Earth is to brighten the surface and
increase the global albedo. This change is primarily accomplished through intensive agriculture where forest,
marshland, and open prairie are cut down and crops like soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton, and rice are grown
in their place. Add this to the current high rates of deforestation in South America and Africa and the
evidence is clear that mankind has increased the Earth's albedo, which should have led to global cooling.
(see Figure Deforestation in the Amazon (2010) (Figure 3.23)
Figure 3.23: Deforestation in the Amazon (2010) Satellite image shows the extent of deforestation
in the Amazon as of 2010. Source: NASA Earth Observatory31
Outside of human inuence, planetary albedo can also be changed by major volcanic eruptions. When
volcanoes erupt, they spew enormous amounts of soot, ash, dust, sulfur, and other aerosols into the atmosphere. During major eruptions, like that of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, some particles of this debris nd their
way into the stratosphere, where they reside for a few years. (see Figure Mt. Pinatubo Erupting in 1991
(Figure 3.24)) The presence of these particles high in the earth's atmosphere acts like a shield that prevents
sunlight from penetrating through the lower atmosphere to warm the earth's surface. Instead, the energy
is either absorbed by the particles or reected and scattered away. The net eect is that large volcanic

eruptions can cool the planet for a few years by changing the earth's albedo.

Philippines in 1991. Source: USGS/Cascades Volcano Observatory32
3.4.3.2 Observations of Solar Output and Volcanic Eruptions
At rst glance the Figure Radiative Forcings & Simulated Temperatures (Figure 3.25) looks quite
complicated, but let's break this graph down to understand how changes in the sun's output and volcanic
eruptions have contributed to recent climate change. In the top panel (a), changes in the amount of energy,
measured in W/m2
, are graphed against time to show how volcanic eruptions have impacted the amount of
energy the earth receives from the sun. Notice that around the year 1815, when Mt. Tambora erupted, there
is a large downward spike in the plot. Now, examine the bottom panel, which shows the NH temperatures,
just as Figure Northern Hemisphere Surface Air (Figure 3.21) displayed, and see how the temperatures
in the years following 1815 took a sharp downward turn. This is a direct consequence of the changes in
albedo caused by large volcanic eruptions. Next, look at the time period between 1000 and 1300 A.D., the
so-called Medieval Warm Period. In panel (b), changes in solar output are graphed against time; notice
that during the Medieval Warm Period, the amount of insolation was high compared to the average. The
opposite occurred during the Little Ice Age which peaked around 400 years ago.

82 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
3.4.3.3 Alterations to the Natural Greenhouse Eect
We have ruled out the rst two mechanisms (i.e., changes in albedo and insolation) as reasons for the recent
increase in global temperatures. But when we look at panel (c) in Figure Radiative Forcings & Simulated
Temperatures (Figure 3.25), we notice that the all other forcing curves point to a rapid increase in the
amount of energy retained by the earth-atmosphere system over the last 200 years. What is responsible for
the increasing tail on this graph? Have humans altered the composition of the Earth's atmosphere to make
it more ecient at absorbing the infrared radiation that would have otherwise been lost to space? Is there
proof of a human enhancement to the natural greenhouse eect? Can we explain the recent warming on an
anthropogenic adjustment to the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2)? Is an enhanced greenhouse
eect to blame for the fact that the top ten warmest years since the modern era of instrument measurements
have occurred since 1995, as seen in Figure Annual Global Temperature Anomalies (Figure 3.26).

1880 to 2007. Source: National Climate Data Center34
Long before the term global warming became a common household phrase, nineteenth-century Irish
physicist John Tyndall said, Remove for a single summer-night the aqueous vapor from the air which
overspreads this country, and you would assuredly destroy every plant capable of being destroyed by a
freezing temperature. This now famous quote reveals the importance of greenhouse gases, like water vapor,
in maintaining a balance between the incident solar radiation and the emitted terrestrial radiation. Tyndall
understood that without greenhouse gases, water vapor being the most abundant, the earth's temperature
would be markedly cooler. The global average surface temperature is approximately 15 ◦C (59 ◦F) but if the
greenhouse gases were removed, the average global temperature would plummet to -18 ◦C (0 ◦F). Remember
that these gases make up a small fraction of the composition of the atmosphere! Therefore, adjustments to
their concentration will produce dramatic eects.
To understand why these gases are so ecient at keeping the planet warm, let's examine Figure Atmospheric Transmission (Figure 3.27). The top panel of this gure shows the normalized intensity of
33http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-6-3.html

the radiation emitted by both the sun and earth as a function of wavelength. The middle panel shows the
total atmospheric absorption spectrum and the bottom panel shows the individual gas absorption spectrum
(excluding Nitrogen and Argon). Notice from the top panel that the sun's peak energy emission falls within
the visible portion of the spectrum and suers very little atmospheric absorption (middle panel). The peak
emission wavelength for the earth is in the thermal infrared (IR), and it is eectively absorbed by water
vapor (H20), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N02). The primary purpose of this
gure is to show that the gases in the earth's atmosphere are transparent to the sun's peak energy emission
(visible light) but not the earth's peak emission (thermal IR). It is through the absorption of the earth's
outgoing thermal infrared radiation that the global average temperature warms approximately 60 ◦F over
what it would be without greenhouse gases.

Are humans altering the natural greenhouse eect? Based upon our assessment so far, this is the nal
mechanism by which the global climate can be changed. Let's look into the alteration of the chemistry
and composition of the earth's atmosphere. First are humans increasing the amount of water vapor, the
most abundant but also weakest greenhouse gas in the atmosphere? As the air temperature increases,
the amount of water vapor the atmosphere can hold also increases. However, a closer investigation of the

water cycle is needed to understand what will happen to this increase in water vapor. In this cycle, the
amount of evaporation must equal the amount of condensation and thus precipitation on a global scale. This
equilibrium must be achieved or else water would end up entirely in its liquid form or in its vapor form.
Also due to the speed at which the hydrological cycle operates, a large increase in water vapor would be
quickly precipitated out of the atmosphere.
Other greenhouse gases progress through their respective cycles much more slowly than water. There
are vast amounts of carbon and carbon dioxide in the earth-atmosphere system. Most carbon is locked up
in rocks, where it may remain for millions of years. The carbon dioxide that is mobile, however, is mostly
found in other places: the ocean, soils, vegetation, fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, and also in small
concentrations in the atmosphere. These reservoirs of CO2 can exchange mass like oceans and clouds do in
the water cycle, but with one extremely important dierencethe exchange rate is much slower. That means
the system can get out of balance and remain out of balance for a long time, hundreds or thousands of years.
There are two primary mechanisms for sequestering carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere: it
can be captured by the respiration of plants, or dissolved in the ocean.
However, the rate at which plants and oceans can take CO2 out of the atmosphere is xed. Therefore, if
a surplus of CO2 is added to the atmosphere, it will stay there for a long time. This has major implications,
given the fact that CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas. The question then to ask becomes, is this exchange
rate out of balance?
The current average concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is about 390 parts per million (PPM), which
means there are 390 parts of CO2 per million parts of air. That does not seem like very much, but if that small
amount of carbon dioxide were removed from the air, the global average temperature would plummet. Has
this concentration been changing? To answer the question, we will turn to the ndings of Richard Keeling,
whose life's work was the observation of CO2 concentrations at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.
Beginning in the early 1950s, observations of CO2, a well-mixed gas in our atmosphere, have shown a
remarkable climb in concentration. (see Figure CO2 Concentrations at the Mauna Loa Observatory
(Figure 3.28)) The Keeling Curve, as it is sometimes called, clearly shows that since the 1950s CO2
concentrations have increased steadily from 315 ppm to 390 ppm. The zigzag nature of this graph is due to
life cycle of plants in the NH. The NH has much more land area that the SH, so when spring and summer
arrive in the NH, the abundance of new plant life reduces the CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. When
the plants die or become dormant in the fall and winter, CO2 concentrations spike again.

concentrations measured in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, since the 1950s. Source: NASA Earth Observatory36
What is troublesome about this gure is that the carbon cycle is out of its normal rhythm and a surplus
of CO2, a known greenhouse gas, is building in the earth's atmosphere. Where is this surplus coming
from? To answer this question, let's look at two historical records of CO2 concentrations taken from ice core
deposits. The top panel in Figure Changes in Greenhouse Gases from Ice Core and Modern Data
(Figure 3.29) shows the past 10,000 years of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Before 1750, the amount of
CO2 in the atmosphere was relatively steady at 280 ppm. Since 1750 there has been a dramatic increase in
CO2 concentrations.

88 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
If we look even further back in time, over the last half million years, we see a similar story. (see Figure
Evidence of Climate Change (Figure 3.30)) The current concentration of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere
is higher than at any time in the past half million years. Where is this abundance of CO2 coming from?
Which reservoirs are being depleted of their CO2 while the atmosphere takes on more? The answer lies
in the burning of fossil fuels and in the deforestation of signicant chunks of the earth's forest biomes.
Notice the spike in CO2 concentrations beginning around 1750. This time period marks the beginning of the
industrial revolution, when fossil fuels overtook wood as the primary energy source on our planet. Over the
subsequent two and a half centuries, oil, coal, and natural gas have been extracted from their underground
reservoirs and burned to generate electricity and power modern forms of transportation. The exhaust from
this process is currently adding 30 billions of tons, or gigatons (Gt), of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
each year. Combine this addition of CO2, a known greenhouse gas, to the subtraction of one of the sinks of
CO2 through deforestation and the imbalance grows even further.

What is the end result? By examining the earth's climate, both current and past and by investigating the
three ways in which climate can change, we have arrived at the conclusion that the current warming is being
caused by an imbalance in the carbon cycle that has been induced by human activity, namely the burning
of fossil fuels. The record warmth over the last 1,300 years is very likely to have been caused by human
decisions that have lead to a change in the chemistry of the atmosphere, and which has altered the natural
climate variability toward warmer global temperatures. We are essentially changing the climate faster and
in a dierent direction than natural processes have intended.

3.4.4 Observed Eects of Climate Change
3.4.4.1 Cherry Blossoms
In Japan each spring millions of people celebrate the blossoming of the cherry trees to mark the arrival
of warmer weather. These celebrations have a long and storied history, and records of the cherry blossom
festivals date back more than a thousand years. In fact, the record of the timing of the cherry blossoms in
Japan is the oldest for any owering plant! Two scientists and historians. Richard Primack and Hiroyoshi
Higuchi recently analyzed this record and found that beginning in the early 1800s the mean air temperature
in March has slowly risen, similar to the increase shown in Figure Northern Hemisphere Surface Air
(Figure 3.21). During this same time period, the owering date has slowly crept earlier in the season, and the
trees are now owering several days before they traditionally owered. Although urbanization of Japan has
lead to an increase in temperature, recent climate change is blamed for the earlier owering of the Japanese
cherry blossom tree. Primack and Higuchi show how Kyoto has warmed an average of 3.4 ◦C over the last
170 years. Climate change has contributed 18% to this total warming in Japan and Primack and Higuchi
demonstrate the correlation of this warming with the industrial revolution.

3.4.4.2 Birds, Mosquitoes, and Fire Ants
A recent article41 in the journal Nature discussed the response of plants and animals to current climate
change. Phenologists, scientists who study how the periodic life cycle events of animals and plants are
aected by variations in climate over the course of seasons and years, are nding that many species of birds
are breeding and singing earlier in the year. Migrant birds are arriving earlier, butteries are appearing
earlier and some amphibians are spawning weeks ahead of their historical schedule. In addition, mountain
tree lines, which are controlled by air temperature, have been advancing to higher altitudes in Europe,
and Arctic shrubs are now found in regions that were once too cold for their existence in Alaska. While
ecological changes such as these may not be threatening from a human perspective, others are. For example,
malaria-carrying mosquitoes in Africa are now being found at altitudes that were once too cold for them,
and outbreaks of malaria are showing up in towns and villages once thought to be out of their reach. In
parts of California and Australia, re ants are migrating to regions that historically have been too cold to
support them.

3.4.4.3 Impacts of Change in the Arctic and the Antarctic
The Arctic and Antarctic are the regions experiencing the most rapid changes due to the recent warming of
the earth's atmosphere. These two regions on Earth are a part of the cryosphere, which is dened as the part
of the Earth that is occupied by sea ice, lake ice, ice caps and permafrost. (For a comprehensive overview
of the current state of the cryosphere and an excellent archive of data, please check out The Cryosphere
Today44 ) As explained in the Module Milankovitch Cycles and the Climate of the Quaternary
(Section 3.3), these regions are most vulnerable due to the powerful ice-albedo eect. One amazing depiction
of polar warming can be found in the drunken forests of Siberia. Larch and spruce trees there are often
seen tilted over on their sides and growing at strange angles. Why? Because the once continually frozen
soil, or permafrost, in which they are rooted has been melting in recent years. As the soil thaws it becomes
more malleable and the trees begin to slant as the soil beneath them sinks. Farther north, Arctic sea ice
has been decreasing both in extent and concentration. In 2007, the smallest extent of sea ice was measured
since the 1970s, and the Northwest Passage opened for commerce and exploration. As the sea ice extent
and concentration decreases, so does the habitat of polar bears. The sea ice is a vital part of their hunting
grounds, and recent decreases of this ice have greatly reduced their access to certain prey. In addition to
sea ice reductions, surface melt of the ice sheet on Greenland has increased in recent years, especially along
its edges. This melt has lead to large pools and streams forming on top of this mile-thick sheet of ice. On
the other side of the world, the Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica recently collapsed, sending a large section

of ice into the sea. This section of the Antarctic ice cap was roughly as large as the state of Rhode Island
and it had been stably attached to the ice shelf for the past 12,000 years. Scientists are closely watching
the Antarctic ice as nearly two-thirds of the world's fresh water resides there. Finally, alpine glacier retreat
has been observed on every continent. With few exceptions, these glaciers have been retracting heavily since
the 1960s, and over that time period NASA reports a global loss of 8,000 cubic kilometers of ice, which
represents a what percentage reduction?

3.4.4.4 The Oceans' Response
Further dramatic changes brought on by recent warming have been observed by scientists concerned with
the world's oceans. Observations of the world's coral reefs have revealed an alarming rate of coral bleaching
(which is not caused by chlorine). As the oceans attempt to uptake the abundance of CO2 and absorb nearly
80% of the heat added to the earth-atmosphere system from the enhanced greenhouse eect, the waters will
inevitably warm. As these waters have warmed over the past 40 years, the delicate ecological balance within
some of the world's coral reefs has been upset leading to coral bleaching. Under warmer waters the rate at
which the algae, which is an important part of the coral ecosystem, undergoes photosynthesis is too much
for the coral to manage. As a result, the coral rids itself of the algae, which leads to an exposure of the white
skeleton of the coral. Another consequence of warming oceans is an increase in sea level. Since 1880, sea
level has risen 20 cm (8 inches). The rise in sea level is associated both with an increase in glacial melt water
and in the thermal expansion of the seawater. An interesting consequence of this rise in sea level has been
the disappearance of the long-disputed New Moore Island between Bangladesh and India. Both countries
laid claim to the shallow, uninhabited island due to the speculation that oil reserves may lie beneath it, but
in 2010, the sea swallowed it. Scientists at the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University,
Kolkatta47 , India suggest global warming played an important part.

Finally, as the planet has adjusted to warmer temperatures the proliferation of drought conditions in some
regions has dramatically aected human populations. The Sahel, for example, is a border region between
the Sahara Desert in the north of Africa and the tropical rainforests that occupy the central part of the
continent. (see Figure The Sahel in Africa (Figure 3.37)) This region is experiencing desertication as
the Sahara steadily expands southward. Since the 1970s, the amount of precipitation in this region has been
steadily below normal. The combination of over irrigation and recent climate change has made the region
uninhabitable and forced millions to relocate.

3.5 Climate Projections51
3.5.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• assess global CO2 emissions and determine which countries and regions are responsible for the greatest
emissions currently and historically
• explain the relationship between fossil fuel usage and CO2 emissions
• link variables such as wealth, population, fuel imports, and deforestation to CO2 emissions
• use IPCC future climate projections to assess future global temperature scenarios
• distinguish between weather events and climate change, and discuss the dierences between weather
forecasting and climate projections
• analyze the anthropogenic impact on climate by examining climate change without people
• assess the regional and global impacts of climate change on air temperature and precipitation
3.5.2 Introduction
In the Module Modern Climate Change (Section 3.4) we discovered that the global warming of approximately 1 ◦C over the past 200 years was human induced through an enhancement of the natural greenhouse
eect. We learned that the burning of fossil fuels has upset the natural carbon cycle, which has steadily
increased the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere since the 1750s. Finally we looked at
ancillary evidence of this warming to see the immediate impact of these changes. In this module we will
investigate the ndings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and look at future climate
projections. We will inspect these ndings and analyze their impacts on a global scale.
3.5.3 Who is Responsible? Factors to Consider
In 2007, the IPCC was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for its work in the area of global climate change.
The IPCC is organized through the United Nations and is composed of over 3,000 scientists from around the
world who are working together to understand current climate change and project future climate scenarios.
As of 2011, the IPCC has released four comprehensive reports, and it has concluded, Most of the observed
increase in global average temperature since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to the observed
increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. This widely known statement essentially means
that the probability of occurrence is greater than 90% that the current global warming is caused by humans
burning fossil fuels. In response to these ndings, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change has called for numerous international meetings in cities including Kyoto, Bali, Copenhagen, and
others where the leaders of world have gathered to discuss strategies to mitigate this looming disaster. At
these meetings, scientists, politicians and world leaders review the current state of knowledge about the
problem and strategize for the future. This chapter will take a large-scale view of the global challenges of
climate change.
Over the past few years, China has surpassed the United States to become the nation that emits more
greenhouse gasses than any other (see Figure CO2 Emissions for the United States and China (Figure 3.39)). Currently, China is responsible for just over 25% of global CO2 emissions, which are approximately
30 Gt per year, with the United States in a close second place. It is important to consider population when
reviewing these numbers because there are over four times as many people living in China than in the
United States. When you compare these two countries on a per capita basis, the average U.S. citizen emits
approximately 19 metric tons of CO2 per year while the average Chinese citizen emits approximately ve
metric tons. In 2009, the United States consumed more than double the amount oil than the second largest
consumer, China, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Topping the list in per capita

CO2 emissions is the oil rich nation of Qatar. This small country located on the Persian Gulf has the largest
per capita production of oil and natural gas. It also has the world's highest gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita. An average citizen in this country emits nearly 60 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each
year.

tons graphed against time for the United States and China. Source: Snodgrass, E.52 created graphs using
data from the U.S. Energy Information Association53
Rather than point the nger at individual countries, let's examine the bigger problem. The maps in
Figure Global Inuence Maps (Figure 3.40) distort the size of each country based on a certain variable,
like CO2 emissions, with respect to the rest of the world. In the upper left panel, the map is based on
population, which is why China and India appear so large. The upper right map distorts the size of the
country based upon fuel imports. Notice that the United States, much of Europe, and Japan are expanded
the most, while Africa, the Middle East, and much of South America are barely visible. Compare these two
maps with absolute wealth and carbon emissions and the story is quite clear. The industrialized and wealthy
nations are responsible for the largest quantities of carbon emissions and fuel imports. These societies are
built on the foundation of energy production through the consumption of fossil fuels.
The bottom two panels tell another aspect of this story. Focus rst on the graph in the lower right,
which shows forest loss by country. The world's forest biomes are a large part of the CO2 cycle and with
deforestation, a large sink for atmospheric CO2 is taken away. Notice that deforestation is most prevalent in
Africa, South America, and Indonesia while the United States is barely visible on this map. In the United
States, reforestation is practiced, but in the rainforests of the world, which are those areas in South America,
Africa, and Indonesia that are ballooned on this map, deforestation is commonplace.

The last graph in Figure Global Inuence Maps (Figure 3.40) distorts each country's size according
to poverty. Much of Asia and Africa are distorted the most, and it is in these regions that we need to
pay close attention over the upcoming years. Many of the nations found within these countries are what
economists and politicians call emerging economies. Although much of the current abundance of CO2 in
the atmosphere is from developed countries such as the United States, CO2 emissions from these countries
are not increasing with time according to a 2008 report from the Energy Information Administration. In
Figure Global CO2 Emissions from Coal Combustion (Figure 3.41), the world's CO2 emissions from
coal combustion in billions of metric tons are plotted against time. Notice that countries of the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which comprises a large group of developed and
industrialized nations, have not increased their CO2 emissions from coal combustion since 1990, and future
projections also reveal a at line in CO2 emissions. Compare this to the non-OECD countries, many of
which are emerging economies like China and India, and you see that CO2 emissions are set to triple in the
next 25 years. There is much debate over information like this now that recent climate change has been
linked so closely to anthropogenic emission of CO2. This debate revolves around the fact that developed
nations used coal, oil, and natural gas during a time when the impacts of CO2 and climate change were not

well researched. This meant that during the time these countries, including the United States, industrialized
there were no regulations on the emissions of CO2. Now that CO2 emissions have been shown to cause global
warming, pressure is being applied to these emerging economies to regulate and control their CO2 emissions.
This is subject of much of the debate at the international climate summits at Kyoto, Bali, and Copenhagen.
What is important to remember when discussing developed countries vs. emerging economies is that the per
capita emissions of CO2 in emerging economies are approximately one third of those for developed countries.

102 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
3.5.4 Climate Projections
One of the greatest obstacles climate scientists face in educating the public on issues of climate change is
time. Most people take weather and climate to be one branch of scientic study. In reality, this could not
be further from the truth. Weather and climate are two separate elds of study that are joined only by
one denitionclimate is the average of weather. It is important to understand this statement because
peoplenews reporters, broadcast meteorologists, politicians, and even scientistsoften make the mistake
of attributing weather events, such as Hurricane Katrina (2005), to global climate change. Katrina was
a weather event and, as such, it cannot be said to have been caused by global climate change. Are the
ingredients for stronger hurricanes present in greater frequency now than they have been in the past? That's
the type of question climate scientists seek to answer, and they do so by analyzing decades worth of data.
Thirty years is the lowest value used in the denominator of climate calculations. In other words, 30 years is
the shortest time period over which weather can be averaged to extract climate information. Therefore, it
is impossible to blame a single weather event on climate changethis branch of science does not work that
way.
To better understand the dierences between weather and climate, take a look at Figure High Temperature vs. Low Temperature, Champaign, IL (Figure 3.42) which shows in red the actual high
temperatures for each day in 2005 in Champaign, Illinois, compared to the average high temperature in
black over a period beginning in 1899 and ending in 2009. It is completely normal for the temperature to
vary ±20 ◦F around this average. In 2005 there were only a handful of days where the actual high was the
same as the average high. This graph shows the highly variable and chaotic behavior of weather. But, when
data from a long span of time is averaged, the climatological mean emerges.

temperature for Champaign-Urbana Illinois in black (1899-2009). The 2005 actual high temperature are
graphed in red. Source: E. Snodgrass56 using data from the National Climate Data Center57
To think of it another way, imagine you are in a large lecture hall with over 300 college students. If
the professor were to call out one student and try to predict the course of her life over the next 70 years it
would be nearly impossible! It would even be dicult to predict when that person would eat her next meal.
However, the professor could project with great condence that on average, most of the people in the room
will eat dinner at 6:30PM on a given night. Beyond this meal, most of them will graduate from college by
the time they are 22 years old. Many will be married by 27 years old and have their rst children at 30.
Most will have a job by the time they are 24 and most will have a job they like by 34. Most will have a
total of 2.1 children by the time they are 36, and by the time they are 50 most will have gone to the doctor
to have their rst routine procedure. Most will retire at 67, and since they are college grads in the United
States, there is a safe bet that they will retire with over a million dollars in assets. On average, the men in
the room will die at 85 years old and most of the women will die before their ninetieth birthday. Now, if the
professor were to single out one individual, the chances that her life would follow this path exactly are small,
but when an entire class of 300 is averaged, this is the result. Weather is like the individual life. Climate
is like the average of 300 lives. Weather and Climate are two separate branches of study in atmospheric
science.

104 CHAPTER 3. CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE
In addition to keeping in mind the dierence between weather and climate, remember that the focus of
this chapter is global climate change. It is tempting to forget the global nature of this problem because it
is happening very slowly on a large scale and it is averaged over long time periods. Recall the dierences
between weather and climate and remember that in conjunction with global warming there can still be
weather events that take temperatures far below normal. The temptation during these events is to discount
the science behind global climate change. For example, during the winter of 2009-2010, the weather patterns
were such that the east coast of the United States experienced repeated record-setting snowstorms and cold
air outbreaks. Many television news reports, weather broadcasts, and newspaper headlines scoed at the
idea of global warming during this winter and proclaimed that it was not happening or that it was a hoax.
The shortsightedness of such responses is evidenced by the fact that globally, 2009 and 2010 were among
the warmest years during the instrument record: 2009 ranked seventh, and 2010 tied for rst. These were
likely two of the warmest years of the last 1,300.
3.5.5 Climate Modeling and Future Climate Predictions
Sometimes people discount climate predictions based on their understanding of weather predictions. They
will say something like, Meteorologists can't even give me a reliable forecast of the weather over the next
three days, how am I supposed to trust them to give me the forecast for the next 100 years. You're not!
Climate scientists do not use weather forecast models to forecast climate conditions 100 years in advance. The
computer models that are used to predict the weather over the next few days are entirely dierent from those
used to predict the climate. Instead of predicting the highly chaotic nature of temperature, precipitation,
and other common weather variables at very high spatial and temporal resolution, climate models forecast
changes in the ux of energy between earth and its atmosphere and space. These two computer-modeling
techniques dier substantially in their computational expense as well. Although weather forecast models are
run on extremely fast computer systems at the National Center for Environmental Prediction, the fastest
computers in the world, like the Earth Simulator in Japan and Blue Waters at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign are charged with climate simulations (see Figure Petascale Computing Facility
(Figure 3.43)).

What are these climate models predicting will happen by the year 2100? First, we will look at the
global average surface temperature projections. Figure Climate Simulation Scenarios (Figure 3.44)
plots global surface warming against time with the present day in the middle of this chart. Recall that over
the last 200 years, there has been a 1 ◦C increase in global temperatures, and that the rate of change has
been extremely fast compared to natural changes in the earth's climate. The graphs in Figure Climate
Simulation Scenarios (Figure 3.44) show the range of model projections from dierent climate simulation
scenarios based upon various greenhouse gas emission scenarios (left graph). Focus on the top and bottom
curves in the right panel, which show the most dramatic warming and the most conservative warming. The
worst-case scenario, found in the top line, shows the business as usual projections. If nothing is done
to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, these climate models are predicting a
4
◦C to 6 ◦C increase in global average temperature by 2100. The best-case scenario, from a climate change
perspective, would be for a cessation of CO2 emissions or for the current emission rates to not increase. In
this case, there would still be a warming of 0.5 ◦
to 2 ◦C by 2100 as indicated by the bottom curves.

In addition to predicting warming of the atmosphere, climate models also suggest that sea level will
continue to rise. Since 1880, sea level has risen 20 cm (approximately 8 inches) as seen in Figure Sea Levels
since 1880 (Figure 3.45). This rise has been primarily the result of the water thermally expanding as it
warms along with the atmosphere. Polar ice cap melt from land-based ice sheets and glaciers has also added
to increase in sea level. The current projection is that sea level will rise at the rate of at least 2 mm per year
over the next century, with an overall increase ranging from 15 to 60 inches cm.

How much condence can we place in predictions about temperature and sea level by climate scientists?
Let's take a little detour before we address this important question directly. Imagine you are contemplating
signing up with a psychic so you can better plan for the futurewhy save for retirement if money is tight
and you're not sure how long you'll live? But you are uncertain about whether she can really see what lies
ahead. You could pay her $20 a week for her predictions, and discover over time whether they come true
or not. The trouble is, during this trial period you wouldn't know whether to spend your money as fast as
you make it or put some aside. But you come up with a better plan. You'll pay the psychic $20 one time,
but instead of asking her to predict your future, you'll ask her to tell what has happened to you in the past
week. If she gets that right, she gets your business.
Along similar lines, climate scientists assess the trustworthiness of their models by checking how well they
predict the past. In Figure Model Simulations (Figure 3.46), 58 dierent climate model simulations
were tasked with predicting the past climate from 1900 to 2005. By comparing the model simulations
to the observed temperature record the scientists with the IPCC tested the accuracy of their models. In
Figure Model Simulations (Figure 3.46), the yellow lines in the top panel trace out the individual model
simulations, the red line shows the model ensemble mean, and the black line represents the actual observed
mean temperature. The models performed exceedingly well, as evidenced by the very small variability

The bottom of Figure Model Simulations (Figure 3.46) and Figure Global Surface Temperature
Comparisons (Figure 3.47) presents the most compelling argument that current climate change is caused
in large part by humans. The bottom panel of Figure Model Simulations (Figure 3.46) shows 19 climate
model simulations between 1900 and 2000 with human inuences left out of the simulations. The thick black
line represents the observed global mean surface temperature over this time. Compare this gure with that
of Figure Global Surface Temperature Comparisons (Figure 3.47), which depicts a series of graphs
that plot temperature anomalies against time from the early 1900s to 2000. The blue color shading on these
graphs shows the computer model projections without anthropogenic eects, while the pink shading includes
them. The black line represents the actual measured air temperatures in each of the locations over which
the inlaid graphs are positioned. Notice that without humans the blue shading stays level or decreases with
time. Compared with the pink shading and the black line, which both increase with time, and we nd
that these climate simulations cannot accurately represent the past climate without anthropogenic eects.
Simply put, these models are unable to represent our current climate without greenhouse contributions from
humans. Rigorous testing like this proves these models are robust and well-designed to simulate future
climate conditions.

The IPCC began its work in the early 1990's and they have released four reports on climate and climate
change. In each report they have included evidence as shown in the sections above. Since a few decades

Globally, an increase of between 2 ◦C and 6 ◦C in mean surface temperature is expected by the year 2100.
Regionally, these values may dier substantially, and some locations may actually cool over the next century.
The hardest hit locations will be the in the high northerly latitudes of the Arctic. Figure Projected

for the time period of 2020-2029 and 2090-2099 with color shading. Notice that in all of these images, the
greatest changes are expected to occur at high northerly latitudes. If these projections hold true, ice and snow
cover will continue to retreat and enhance the ice-albedo eect discussed in Module Climate Processes;
External and Internal Controls (Section 3.2). Since the 1980s, NH snow-covered area has shrunk by 3
million square kilometers, and many northerly lakes are spending less time each year covered in ice.

Aside from air temperature, global precipitation patterns and amounts are expected to change. As the
atmosphere warms, its ability to hold water vapor increases, which leads to more evaporation from water on
the earth's surface. As this water condenses in the earth's atmosphere to form clouds and precipitation, the
distribution of the precipitation will vary greatly. Current projections forecast an increase in precipitation
in the tropics and polar latitudes, with drier conditions over the mid-latitudes. Even though there will
be more water vapor in the atmosphere, the distribution of precipitation may be such that large regions
formerly unused to drought may be subjected to prolonged dry periods. Focus on the middle panels of
Figure Winter and Summer Precipitation Anomalies (Figure 3.50), which shows the winter (top) and
summer (bottom) precipitation anomalies. Notice that the tropics and polar regions are expected to have
above normal precipitation, while the mid-latitudes have below normal precipitation. Although more areas
are expected to experience prolonged drought, these projections suggest that when it does rain, rainfall will
arrive in much greater amounts over shorter time periods. This will lead to increased ash ooding, the
deadliest weather phenomenon in the United States.

The goal of climate science is not to craft public policy on global warming. It is to provide the public and
policymakers alike with reasonable projections about future climate conditions. This information should be
used to show the potential impacts of our presence on the climate system so as to form the best possible
mitigation plans. Current projections show that if we are able to slow greenhouse gas emissions, the climate
system will respond with the least amount of warming. They also suggest that if we continue with "business
as usual" the change in the global climate will be great in magnitude and occur very quicklyboth beyond
past "natural" change.
3.5.7 Review Questions
Question 3.5.1
How much CO2 does the average world citizen release each year into the atmosphere? Assume a
population of 7 billion people. Compare this number to the United States, China and Qatar.
Question 3.5.2
Explain why the April 2011 tornado outbreak, which set the record for the most tornadoes in a
singe 24-hour period, cannot be blamed on climate change.
Question 3.5.3
In Illinois, during the summer of 2009 only two days topped 90 ◦F. In total it was the seventh
coolest summer on record. Does this disprove climate change? In what context should we view this
cold summer in Illinois?
Question 3.5.4

4.1 Biosphere  Chapter Introduction1
4.1.1 Introduction
Humanity and the natural world are inextricably linked. A growing appreciation for the importance of this
fact led to the formation and publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment by the United Nations
in 2005. It denes key concepts necessary for understanding how sustainable development can be achieved.
In the terms of the Assessment, an ecosystem is a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism
communities and the nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit, while ecosystem services
are the benets people obtain from ecosystems. Ecosystem services are critical to human well-being and
suciently diverse and numerous to justify classication into four major categories (see Figure Ecosystem
Services (p. 117)). Provisioning ecosystem services are actively harvested by us from the natural
world to meet our resource needs, e.g. food, water, timber, and ber. Regulating ecosystem services
are processes in the Earth system that control key physical and biological elements of our environment, e.g.
climate regulation, ood regulation, disease regulation, water purication. Cultural ecosystem services
reect the aesthetic and spiritual values we place on nature, as well as the educational and recreational
activities dependent on ecosystems. Finally, supporting ecosystem services are the biogeochemical
cycles, as well as biological and physical processes that drive ecosystem function, e.g. soil formation, nutrient
cycling, and photosynthesis.

We benet from the services associated with both pristine, natural ecosystems, such as tropical rain
forests or arctic tundra, and highly managed ecosystems, such as crop elds or urban landscapes. In all
cases, ecosystems contribute to human well-being by inuencing the attainability of basic material needs
(e.g. food and shelter), health (e.g. clean air and water), good social relations and security (i.e. sucient
resources to avoid conict, tolerate natural and man-made disasters, provide for children, and maintain social
cohesion), as well as freedom of choice and action (an inherent component of the other elements of well-being
is the right to live as one chooses). Linkages between some ecosystem services and human well-being vary
in strength depending on socio-economic status (see Figure Ecosystem Services (p. 117)). For example,
many people in developed countries can always aord to buy imported food without dependence on the yields
of locally grown crops, thereby avoiding shortages when yields are low because of bad weather. However, in
other cases our ability to control the impact of losing an ecosystem service on human well-being is limited.
For example, despite major engineering eorts ooding still causes considerable human and economic damage
in developed countries.
The challenge of sustainable development stems from the need to benet from and manage ecosystem
services without causing damage to the ecosystems and Earth system that will reduce their value in the longer
term. People have long recognized that some ways of using natural resources are unsustainable, especially

where ecosystems are rapidly exploited to the maximum extent possible and further access to the ecosystem
services can be achieved only by moving on to previously unexploited areas, as in the case of slash and burn
agriculture. Only more recently have we come to appreciate that human activity is altering global-scale
phenomena, such as climate regulation, and this understanding raises a host of dicult questions. That is
because the benet of an ecosystem service may be realized by people in one locale, while the costs (in the
form of negative environmental consequences) are imposed on people who live elsewhere, and who may be
less equipped to withstand them.
The following sections discuss: (1) the natural biogeochemical cycling of carbon, water and nitrogen,
the ecosystem services we derive from these biogeochemical cycles and human activities that are disturbing
them; (2) species extinctions and ecosystem changes being caused by human activity; and (3) soil, how it is
formed, its value to society, and practices that diminish or degrade it.
4.2 Biogeochemical Cycles and the Flow of Energy in the Earth
System3
4.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• explain the concept of a biogeochemical cycle, incorporating the terms "pool" and "ux"
• describe the natural cycles of carbon, water, and nitrogen
• name some of the important ways human activity disrupts those cycles
4.2.2 Introduction
If people are to live sustainably, they will need to understand the processes that control the availability
and stability of the ecosystem services on which their well-being depends. Chief among these processes are
the biogeochemical cycles that describehow chemical elements (e.g. nitrogen, carbon) or molecules (e.g.
water) are transformed and stored by both physical and biological components of the Earth system. Storage
occurs in pools, which are amounts of material that share some common characteristic and are relatively
uniform in nature, e.g. the pool of carbon found as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Transformations
or ows of materials from one pool to another in the cycle are described as uxes; for example, the movement
of water from the soil to the atmosphere resulting from evaporation is a ux. Physical components of
the earth system are nonliving factors such as rocks, minerals, water, climate, air, and energy. Biological
components of the earth system include all living organisms, e.g. plants, animals and microbes. Both
the physical and biological components of the earth system have varied over geological time. Some landmark
changes include the colonization of the land by plants (∼400 million years ago), the evolution of mammals
(∼200 million years ago), the evolution of modern humans (∼200 thousand years ago) and the end of the last
ice age (∼10 thousand years ago). The earth system and its biogeochemical cycles were relatively stable from
the end of the last ice age until the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries initiated
a signicant and ongoing rise in human population and activity. Today, anthropogenic (human) activities
are altering all major ecosystems and the biogeochemical cycles they drive. Many chemical elements and
molecules are critical to life on earth, but the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, water, and nitrogen are most
critical to human well-being and the natural world.
4.2.3 The Natural Carbon Cycle
Most of the carbon on Earth is stored in sedimentary rocks and does not play a signicant role in the
carbon cycle on the timescale of decades to centuries. The atmospheric pool of CO2 is smaller [containing

800 GtC (gigatonnes of carbon) = 800,000,000,000 tonnes] but is very important because it is a greenhouse
gas. The sun emits short-wave radiation that passes through the atmosphere, is absorbed by the Earth, and
re-emitted as long-wave radiation. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb this long-wave radiation
causing them, and the atmosphere, to warm. The retention of heat in the atmosphere increases and stabilizes
the average temperature, making Earth habitable for life. More than a quarter of the atmospheric CO2 pool
is absorbed each year through the process of photosynthesis by a combination of plants on land (120 GtC)
and at sea (90 GtC). Photosynthesis is the process in which plants use energy from sunlight to combine
CO2 from the atmosphere with water to make sugars, and in turn build biomass. Almost as much carbon
is stored in terrestrial plant biomass (550 GtC) as in the atmospheric CO2 pool. On land, biomass that
has been incorporated into soil forms a relatively large pool (2300 GtC). At sea, the phytoplankton that
perform photosynthesis sink after they die, transporting organic carbon to deeper layers that then either
are preserved in ocean sediments or decomposed into a very large dissolved inorganic carbon pool (37,000
GtC). Plants are called primary producers because they are the primary entry point of carbon into the
biosphere. In other words, almost all animals and microbes depend either directly or indirectly on plants as
a source of carbon for energy and growth. All organisms, including plants, release CO2 to the atmosphere
as a by-product of generating energy and synthesizing biomass through the process of respiration. The
natural carbon cycle is balanced on both land and at sea, with plant respiration and microbial respiration
(much of it associated with decomposition, or rotting of dead organisms) releasing the same amount of CO2
as is removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis.

4.2.3.1 Human Interactions with The Carbon Cycle
The global carbon cycle contributes substantially to the provisioning ecosystem services upon which humans
depend. We harvest approximately 25% of the total plant biomass that is produced each year on the land
surface to supply food, fuel wood and ber from croplands, pastures and forests. In addition, the global
carbon cycle plays a key role in regulating ecosystem services because it signicantly inuences climate via
its eects on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Atmospheric CO2 concentration increased from 280 parts per
million (ppm) to 390 ppm between the start of industrial revolution in the late eighteenth century and 2010.
This reected a new ux in the global carbon cycle anthropogenic CO2 emissions where humans
release CO2 into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels and changing land use. Fossil fuel burning takes
carbon from coal, gas, and oil reserves, where it would be otherwise stored on very long time scales, and
introduces it into the active carbon cycle. Land use change releases carbon from soil and plant biomass

pools into the atmosphere, particularly through the process of deforestation for wood extraction or conversion
of land to agriculture. In 2009, the additional ux of carbon into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources
was estimated to be 9 GtCa signicant disturbance to the natural carbon cycle that had been in balance
for several thousand years previously. Slightly more than half of this anthropogenic CO2 is currently being
absorbed by greater photosynthesis by plants on land and at sea (5 GtC). However, that means 4 GtC is
being added to the atmospheric pool each year and, while total emissions are increasing, the proportion
absorbed by photosynthesis and stored on land and in the oceans is declining (Le Quere et al., 2009 (p.
126)). Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the twentieth century caused increases in temperature and
started to alter other aspects of the global environment. Global environmental change has already caused
a measurable decrease in the global harvest of certain crops. The scale and range of impacts from global
environmental change of natural and agricultural ecosystems is projected to increase over the twenty-rst
century, and will pose a major challenge to human well-being.
4.2.4 The Natural Water Cycle
The vast majority of water on Earth is saline (salty) and stored in the oceans. Meanwhile, most of the
world's fresh water is in the form of ice, snow, and groundwater. This means a signicant fraction of the
water pool is largely isolated from the water cycle. The major long-term stores of fresh water include ice
sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, as well as groundwater pools that were lled during wetter periods
of past geological history. In contrast, the water stored in rivers, lakes, and ocean surface is relatively
rapidly cycled as it evaporates into the atmosphere and then falls back to the surface as precipitation. The
atmospheric pool of water turns over most rapidly because it is small compared to the other pools (e.g.
<15% of the freshwater lake pool). Evaporation is the process whereby water is converted from a liquid
into a vapor as a result of absorbing energy (usually from solar radiation). Evaporation from vegetated
land is referred to as evapotranspiration because it includes water transpired by plants, i.e. water taken
up from the soil by roots, transported to leaves and evaporated from leaf surfaces into the atmosphere via
stomatal pores. Precipitation is the conversion of atmospheric water from vapor into liquid (rain) or solid
forms (snow, hail) that then fall to Earth's surface. Some water from precipitation moves over the land
surface by surface runo and streamow, while other water from precipitation inltrates the soil and
moves below the surface as groundwater discharge. Water vapor in the atmosphere is commonly moved
away from the source of evaporation by wind and the movement of air masses. Consequently, most water
falling as precipitation comes from a source of evaporation that is located upwind. Nonetheless, local sources
of evaporation can contribute as much as 25-33% of water in precipitation.

4.2.4.1 Human Interactions with The Water Cycle
Freshwater supply is one of the most important provisioning ecosystem services on which human well-being
depends. By 2000, the rate of our water extraction from rivers and aquifers had risen to almost 4000
cubic kilometers per year. The greatest use of this water is for irrigation in agriculture, but signicant
quantities of water are also extracted for public and municipal use, as well as industrial applications and
power generation. Other major human interventions in the water cycle involve changes in land cover and
infrastructure development of river networks. As we have deforested areas for wood supply and agricultural
development we have reduced the amount of vegetation, which naturally acts to trap precipitation as it falls
and slow the rate of inltration into the ground. As a consequence, surface runo has increased. This,
in turn, means ood peaks are greater and erosion is increased. Erosion lowers soil quality and deposits
sediment in river channels, where it can block navigation and harm aquatic plants and animals. Where
agricultural land is also drained these eects can be magnied. Urbanization also accelerates streamow
by preventing precipitation from ltering into the soil and shunting it into drainage systems. Additional
physical infrastructure has been added to river networks with the aim of altering the volume, timing, and
direction of water ows for human benet. This is achieved with reservoirs, weirs, and diversion channels.
For example, so much water is removed or redirected from the Colorado River in the western United States
that, despite its considerable size, in some years it is dry before reaching the sea in Mexico. We also exploit

waterways through their use for navigation, recreation, hydroelectricity generation and waste disposal. These
activities, especially waste disposal, do not necessarily involve removal of water, but do have impacts on water
quality and water ow that have negative consequences for the physical and biological properties of aquatic
ecosystems.
The water cycle is key to the ecosystem service of climate regulation as well as being an essential supporting service that impacts the function of all ecosystems. Consider the widespread impacts on diverse natural
and human systems when major droughts or oods occur. Consequently, human disruptions of the natural
water cycle have many undesirable eects and challenge sustainable development. There are two major
concerns. First, the need to balance rising human demand with the need to make our water use sustainable by reversing ecosystem damage from excess removal and pollution of water. Traditionally, considerable
emphasis has been on nding and accessing more supply, but the negative environmental impacts of this
approach are now appreciated, and improving the eciency of water use is now a major goal. Second, there
is a need for a safe water supply in many parts of the world, which depends on reducing water pollution and
improving water treatment facilities.
4.2.5 The Natural Nitrogen Cycle
The vast majority of nitrogen on Earth is held in rocks and plays a minor role in the nitrogen cycle. The
second largest pool of nitrogen is in the atmosphere. Most atmospheric nitrogen is in the form of N2 gas, and
most organisms are unable to access it. This is signicant because nitrogen is an essential component of all
cellsfor instance, in protein, RNA, and DNAand nitrogen availability frequently limits the productivity
of crops and natural vegetation. Atmospheric nitrogen is made available to plants in two ways. Certain
microbes are capable of biological nitrogen xation, whereby N2 is converted into ammonium, a form of
nitrogen that plants can access. Many of these microbes have formed symbiotic relationships with plants
they live within the plant tissue and use carbon supplied by the plant as an energy source, and in return
they share ammonia produced by nitrogen xation. Well-known examples of plants that do this are peas
and beans. Some microbes that live in the soil are also capable of nitrogen xation, but many are found
in a zone very close to roots, where signicant carbon sources are released from the plant. Together these
biological nitrogen xing processes on land, coupled with others that take place at sea, generate an annual
ux out of the atmosphere of approximately 200 MtN (megatonnnes of nitrogen or 200,000,000 tonnes of
nitrogen). Lightning causes nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere to react and produce nitrous oxides that
fall or are washed out of the atmosphere by rain and into the soil, but the is ux is much smaller (30 MtN
per year at most) than biological nitrogen xation.
While the inputs of nitrogen from the atmosphere to the biosphere are important, the majority (90%)
of nitrogen used by plants for growth each year comes from ammonication of organic material. Organic
material is matter that comes from once-living organisms. Ammonication (or mineralization) is the release
of ammonia by decomposers (bacteria and fungi) when they break down the complex nitrogen compounds
in organic material. Plants are able to absorb (assimilate) this ammonia, as well as nitrates, which are made
available by bacterial nitrication. The cycle of nitrogen incorporation in growing plant tissues and nitrogen
release by bacteria from decomposing plant tissues is the dominant feature of the nitrogen cycle and occurs
very eciently. Nitrogen can be lost from the system in three main ways. First, denitrifying bacteria
convert nitrates to nitrous oxide or N2 gases that are released back to the atmosphere. Denitrication occurs
when the bacteria grow under oxygen-depleted conditions, and is therefore favored by wet and waterlogged
soils. Denitrication rates almost match biological nitrogen xation rates, with wetlands making the greatest
contribution. Second, nitrates are washed out of soil in drainage water (leaching) and into rivers and the
ocean. Third, nitrogen is also cycled back into the atmosphere when organic material burns.

.
4.2.5.1 Human Interactions With The Nitrogen Cycle
Humans are primarily dependent on the nitrogen cycle as a supporting ecosystem service for crop and
forest productivity. Nitrogen fertilizers are added to enhance the growth of many crops and plantations.
The enhanced use of fertilizers in agriculture was a key feature of the green revolution that boosted global
crop yields in the 1970s. The industrial production of nitrogen-rich fertilizers has increased substantially
over time and now matches more than half of the input to the land from biological nitrogen xation (90
MtN each year). If the nitrogen xation from leguminous crops (e.g. beans, alfalfa) is included, then the
anthropogenic ux of nitrogen from the atmosphere to the land exceeds natural uxes to the land. As
described above, most ecosystems naturally retain and recycle almost all of their nitrogen. The relatively
little nitrogen that is being gained or lost by uxes to the atmosphere and water cycle is also nearly being
balanced. When humans make large additions of nitrogen to ecosystems leakage often results, with negative
environmental consequences. When the amount of nitrate in the soil exceeds plant uptake, the excess
nitrate is either leached in drainage water to streams, rivers, and the ocean or denitried by bacteria and
lost to the atmosphere. One of the main gases produced by denitrifying bacteria (nitrous oxide) is an
important greenhouse gas that is contributing to human-induced global warming. Other gases released to
the atmosphere by denitrifying bacteria, as well as ammonia released from livestock and sewage sludge,
are later deposited from the atmosphere onto ecosystems. The additional nitrogen from this deposition,

126 CHAPTER 4. BIOSPHERE
along with the nitrogen leaching into waterways, causes eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when plant
growth and then decay is accelerated by an unusually high supply of nitrogen, and it has knock-on eects,
including the following: certain plant species out-competing other species, leading to biodiversity loss and
altered ecosystem function; algal blooms that block light and therefore kill aquatic plants in rivers, lakes,
and seas; exhaustion of oxygen supplies in water caused by rapid microbial decomposition at the end of
algal blooms, which kills many aquatic organisms. Excess nitrates in water supplies have also been linked to
human health problems. Eorts to reduce nitrogen pollution focus on increasing the eciency of synthetic
fertilizer use, altering feeding of animals to reduce nitrogen content in their excreta, and better processing
of livestock waste and sewage sludge to reduce ammonia release. At the same time, increasing demand for
food production from a growing global population with a greater appetite for meat is driving greater total
fertilizer use, so there is no guarantee that better practices will lead to a reduction in the overall amount of
nitrogen pollution.
4.2.6 Review Questions
Question 4.2.1
There is approximately 2,000 cubic kilometers of water stored in rivers around the world. Using the
terms water cycle, ux and pool, describe under what conditions removing 1000 cubic kilometers
per year from rivers for human use could be sustainable.
Question 4.2.2
Each year, around a quarter of the carbon dioxide found in the atmosphere is turned into plant
matter via photosynthesis. Does this mean that, in the absence of human activity, all carbon dioxide
would be removed from the atmosphere in around four years? Explain your answer.
Question 4.2.3
The water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles are all inuenced by human activity. Can you describe
a human activity that impacts all three cycles? In your example, which of the cycles is most
signicantly altered?

4.3.2 What is Biodiversity?
You're probably familiar with the word, biodiversity, whether or not you can give an exact denition of
it. It's common on the signs at zoos, parks, and nature centers, and it's often used without explanation
or denition. Most people understand biodiversity in general terms as the number and mix of plant and
animal species that occurs in a given place. Scientists are more precise and include more in their denition.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)9
, which coordinates eorts to catalogue
and preserve biodiversity worldwide, denes biodiversity as "the variability among living organisms from all
sources including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which
they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems." Rather than just
species, biodiversity therefore includes variation from the level of genes and genomes to that of ecosystems
to biomes.
Even within a single ecosystem, the numbers of species can be impressive. For example, there is a large
region of dry forest and savanna in Brazil known as the Cerrado (see Figure Cerrado Forest (Figure 4.5)).
This ecosystem alone hosts over 10,000 species of plants, almost 200 species of mammals, over 600 species
of birds, and about 800 species of sh.

Generally, biodiversity is greatest in tropical areasespecially "rainforests"but there are terrestrial
biodiversity "hotspots" on all the major continents. (View an interactive map of hotspots11 .)
4.3.3 Current Trends: Species Loss and Decline
One way scientists gauge trends in biodiversity is by monitoring the fate of individual species of animals
and plants. For more than 40 years, the IUCN has compiled information in the "Red List of Threatened
Species," which "provides a snapshot of what is happening to species around the world." Updates to the
Red List are released every four years. Here is how the authors of the most recent one, released in 2008,
characterize the news it holds: "The overwhelming message" from the 2008 Red List, they write, "is that
the world is losing species and that the rate of loss appears to be accelerating in many taxonomic groups"
(Vie, Hilton-Taylor, & Stuart, 2008, p. 38 (p. 134)).

described, for example, has been evaluated for purposes of the Red List. Of them, 76 species have become
extinct since 1500, and two, Pere David's deer, which is native to China, and the scimitar oryx from Africa
survive only in managed facilities. Another 29 of the mammal species listed as critically endangered are also
tagged as "possibly extinct;" they are very likely gone, but the sort of exhaustive surveys required to conrm
that fact have not been conducted. Overall, approximately 22% of mammal species worldwide are known to
be threatened or extinct. (In the terms of the Red List, the broad designation "threatened" includes three
levels of risk for extinction in the wild: Vulnerable [high], Endangered [higher], and Critically Endangered
[highest].)
The Red List categorizes a smaller proportion of the world's 9,990 described bird species14%as
threatened or extinct. But the raw number of species lost since 1500 is at least 134, and four more species
persist only in zoos. Another 15 species of birds are considered possibly extinct. The fact that 86% of bird
species are categorized as "not threatened" is good news in the context of the Red List.

Among the well-studied vertebrates, amphibians are faring especially poorly. Of the more than 6,000
known species of amphibians, 38 have become extinct worldwide since 1500, and another one, the Wyoming

one-third of the world's amphibian species are known to be threatened or extinct. More troubling still, many
amphibian species42.5%are reported to be declining, and that number is probably low, since trend
information is unavailable for 30.4% of species.

.
Only small proportions of the world's species of reptiles and sh have been evaluated for purposes of the
Red List. Among those, the numbers of species that fall into the threatened category are very high: 1,275
of the 3,481 evaluated species, or 37%, for sh; and 423 of 1,385 evaluated species, or 31%, for reptiles. It
should be noted, however, that these percentages are likely overestimates, since species of concern are more
likely to be selected for evaluation than others.
4.3.3.2 Invertebrates
The category "invertebrates" lumps together the vast majority of multi-cellular animals, an estimated 97%
of all species. It includes everything from insects and arachnids, to mollusks, crustaceans, corals, and more.
Few of these groups have been assessed in a comprehensive way, and so as with sh and reptiles, the Red
List percentages of threatened species are skewed high. But assessments within some groups call attention
to disturbing, large-scale trends. For example, 27% of the world's reef-building corals are already considered
threatened, and many more of them are experiencing rates of decline that move them toward threatened

status. The demise of reef-building corals has magnied ecological impacts, since so much other marine life
depends on them.

nearby. Source: Linda Wade via National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)16
.
It should be understood that information about familiar creatures such as amphibians, mammals, and
birds is just a beginning, and that even with the inclusion of some invertebrates the Red List does not
provide a comprehensive picture of life on Earth. Scientists have described fewer than 2 million of the 8-9
million species of organisms thought to exist, most of which are insects. And of those 2 million, the status
of only 44,838 has been assessed by IUCN.

133
In addition, it should be understood that among the species that have been assessed so far, there is a
strong bias toward terrestrial vertebrates and plants, especially the ones that occur where biologists have
visited frequently. Red List assessments also tend to focus on species that are likely to be threatened, since
the eort also has the aim of enabling people to conserve species.
Whereas extinction is the global loss of a species, the elimination of species at a local levelknown as
extirpation  also poses threats to the integrity and sustainability of ecosystems. Widespread extirpation
obviously leads to threatened or endangered status, but absence of species, even at a local scale, can aect
ecosystem function. For example, by the mid-1920s wolves had been extirpated from Yellowstone National
Park, although they continued to thrive elsewhere. When wolves were reintroduced to the park in the mid1990s, numbers of elk (a main prey item) decreased signicantly. This, in turn, reduced browsing pressure
and had a signicant eect on the vegetation and plant communities. What mattered for ecosystem function
in Yellowstone was whether wolves were present there, not just whether the species survived somewhere.
The human activities that account for extinction and extirpation vary considerably from one species
to another, but they fall into a few broad categories: habitat destruction and fragmentation; intentional
and unintentional movement of species that become invasive (including disease-causing organisms); overexploitation (unsustainable hunting, logging, etc.); habitat/ecosystem degradation (e.g. pollution, climate
change).
4.3.4 Current Trends: Ecosystem Loss and Alteration
Another way of gauging biodiversity involves assessment on the scale of ecosystems. The causes of wholesale
losses of ecosystems are much the same as those driving extinction or endangerment of species, with habitat
loss and fragmentation being the primary agent. Worldwide, for example, the conversion of land to agriculture
and cultivation have led to signicant losses in grassland ecosystems. In North America, nearly 70% of the
tallgrass prairie ecosystem (which once covered 142 million acres) has been converted to agriculture, and
losses from other causes, such as urban development, have brought the total to about 90%. Current estimates
indicate that agricultural activity and cultivation systems now cover nearly 25% of the Earth's surface.
Tropical rainforests, which are the habitats for nearly half of the world's plant and animal species, covered
about 4 billion acres in past centuries, but only 2.5 billion acres remain and nearly 1% is being lost annually.
Losses have been especially severe in the "paleo" or old world tropics that include Africa and Southeast Asia.
The category "wetlands" includes many types of ecosystems, but current estimates indicate that about
50% of the world's wetland habitat has been lost. The former extent of wetland habitats worldwide (fresh,
brackish and salt) is dicult to determine but certainly exceeded a billion acres.
4.3.5 Species and Ecosystem Loss in Perspective
To understand why biologists talk about ongoing losses of species and ecosystems as the "biodiversity crisis,"
it is useful to put current and projected rates of species loss into historical perspective. Over the history of
life on Eartha span of 3.5 billion yearsnearly all species that existed eventually became extinct. This,
of course, is coupled with the processes of speciation and biological diversication. Rates of extinction and
diversication have uctuated signicantly over geologic time. For extinction, paleontologists have detected
ve episodes of mass extinction over the last 540 million years. These periods contrast with the relatively
constant "background rate" of extinction observed over the geologic record, and include the relatively wellknown event 65 million years ago when most of the extant dinosaurs went extinct. By denition, these
episodes are characterized by the comparatively rapid loss of at least three-fourths of the species thought to
exist at the onset of the event.
Recently, the question has been posed whether present-day rates of species loss constitute a sixth episode
of mass extinction (Barnosky, et al., 2011 (p. 134)). Even with caveats about uncertainty in how many
species there are today (only a fraction of the estimated total have been described, especially for plants,
invertebrates, and microbes) and about comparisons of the fossil record with modern data, it appears that
estimated rates of loss in the near future could rival those of past mass extinctions. Some estimates indicate
Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11325/1.45>
134 CHAPTER 4. BIOSPHERE
that we will see a 30% loss of species within decades. Put another way, forecasted rates of species loss could
be as much as 1000 to 10,000 times higher than background rates.
4.3.6 How Does Loss of Biodiversity Concern People?
As we learn more about biodiversity, it is becoming clear that there is often a positive association between
biodiversity and the integrity of biological systems. This is not to say more diverse systems are "better;"
rather, this means that systems with a relatively pristine complement of biological and abiotic or physical
components tend to be more resilient and robust. Whereas this is rather nebulous, there is little doubt that
the integrity of ecosystems is of fundamental importance to nearly all phases of human life and culture.
Often called ecological services, the products and processes associated with biological systems are
of immense value to the well being of people. An incomplete list of these services and products includes
the formation of soil and cycling of nutrients; provisioning of food, fresh water, fuel, ber, and recreation
opportunities; the regulation of climate, ooding, and disease. The value of these services is often overlooked
or simply taken for granted, but one global estimate puts it somewhere between $16-64 trillion annually.
From global food security, to a source of medicines, to even the oxygen in our air, we are dependent on
biodiversity and the sustained integrity of ecological systems. Nature is also the basis for a signicant part
of aesthetic and spiritual values held by many cultures.
Given this dependence, it is astounding that many are unaware oreven worseapathetic about what is
occurring and what will likely happen in the near future to our biological resources. We do not contend that
any loss of species will aect productivity or function at the ecosystem level. The function of one species can
be redundant with others and its loss may not lead to a signicant change at the ecosystem level. Whereas
redundancy can contribute to the resiliency of natural systems, that should not be a source of comfort. Much
ecological theory posits thresholds of species loss beyond which the integrity of ecosystems is threatened;
unexpected and possibly permanent new "states" may result. Once a community or ecosystem reaches an
alternative state, there may be little that can be done to restore or remediate the system. Therefore, even
under optimistic scenarios for rates of species loss (from the local to global scale) we are facing an uncertain
environment.

We will use this denition in this chapter. In common usage, the term soil is sometimes restricted to
only the dark topsoil in which we plant our seeds or vegetables. In a more broad denition, civil engineers
use the term soil for any unconsolidated (soft when wet) material that is not considered bedrock. Under this
denition, soil can be as much as several hundred feet thick! Ancient soils, sometimes buried and preserved in
the subsurface, are referred to as paleosols (see Figure Modern versus Buried Soil Proles (Figure 4.11))
and reect past climatic and environmental conditions.

From a somewhat philosophical standpoint, soil can be viewed as the interface between the atmosphere
and the earth's crust, and is sometimes referred to as the skin of the earth. Soil also incorporates aspects
of the biosphere and the hydrosphere. From a physical standpoint, soil contains solid, liquid, and gaseous
phases. The solid portion of the soil consists predominantly of mineral matter, but also contains organic

4.4.2.2 Importance of Soil
Soil is important to our society as it provides the foundation for most of the critical aspects of civilization.
Our building structures and homes, food, agricultural products, and wood products all rely on soil. Forests,
prairies, and wetlands all have a dependence on soil. Of course, soil is also a critical component for terrestrial
life on earth, including most animals, plants, and many microorganisms.
Soil plays a role in nearly all natural cycles on the earth's surface. Global cycling of key nutrients, such
as Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N), Sulfur (S), and Phosphorous (P), all pass through soil. In the hydrologic cycle,
soil helps to mediate the ow of precipitation from the land surface into the groundwater or can control
stormwater runo into lakes, streams, bays, and oceans. Soil microorganisms or microora can help to
modify or destroy environmental pollutants.
4.4.2.3 Soil Forming Factors
The fundamental factors that aect soil genesis can be categorized into ve elements: climate, organisms,
relief, parent material, and time. One could say that the landscape relief, climate, and organisms dictate the
local soil environment, and act together to cause weathering and mixing of the soil parent material over time.
The soil forming factors are interrelated and interdependent, but considered independently they provide a
useful framework for discussion and categorization.
As soil is formed it often has distinct layers, which are formally described as "horizons." Upper horizons
(labeled as the A and O horizons) are richer in organic material and so are important in plant growth, while
deeper layers (such as the B and C horizons) retain more of the original features of the bedrock below.
4.4.2.3.1 Climate
The role of climate in soil development includes aspects of temperature and precipitation.Soils in very cold
areas with permafrost conditions (Gelisols) tend to be shallow and weakly developed due to the short growing
season. Organic rich surface horizons are common in low-lying areas due to limited chemical decomposition.
In warm, tropical soils (Ultisols, Oxisols), other factors being equal, soils tend to be thicker, with extensive
leaching and mineral alteration. In such climates, organic matter decomposition and chemical weathering
occur at an accelerated rate.
4.4.2.3.2 Organisms
Animals, plants, and microorganisms all have important roles in soil development processes, in providing
a supply of organic matter, and/or in nutrient cycling. Worms, nematodes, termites, ants, gophers, moles,
craysh, etc. all cause considerable mixing of soil and help to blend soil, aerate and lighten the soil by
creating porosity, and create characteristic natural soil structure over time. Animal life, such as insects and
mammals, can cause irregularities in the soil horizons.
Plant life provides much organic matter to soil and helps to recycle nutrients with uptake by roots in
the subsurface. The type of plant life that occurs in a given area, such as types of trees or grasses, depends
on the climate, along with parent material and soil type. So there are clearly feedbacks among the soil
forming factors. With the annual dropping of leaves and needles, trees tend to add organic matter to soil
surfaces, helping to create a thin, organic-rich A or O horizon over time. Grasses, on the other hand, have
a considerable root mass, in addition to surcial organic material, that is released into the soil each fall for
annuals and short-lived perennials. For this reason, grassland soils (Mollisols) have much thicker A horizons
with higher organic matter contents, and are more agriculturally productive than forest soils. Grasses release
organic matter to soils that is more rich in base cations, whereas leaf and needle litter result in release of
acids into the soil.

140 CHAPTER 4. BIOSPHERE
Microorganisms aid in the oxidation of organic residues and in production of humus material. They also
play a role in iron oxidation-reduction cycles, ne-grained mineral dissolution (providing nutrients to soil
solutions), and mineral neoformation. New research is continually expanding our knowledge of the role of
microorganisms in plant growth, nutrient cycling, and mineral transformations.
4.4.2.3.3 Relief (Topography and Drainage)
The local landscape can have a surprisingly strong eect on the soils that form on site. The local topography
can have important microclimatic eects as well as aecting rates of soil erosion. In comparison to at
regions, areas with steep slopes overall have more soil erosion, more runo of rainwater, and less water
inltration, all of which lead to more limited soil development in very hilly or mountainous areas. In the
northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes are exposed to more direct sunlight angles and are thus warmer and
drier than north-facing slopes. The cooler, moister north-facing slopes have a more dynamic plant community
due to less evapotranspiration and, consequently, experience less erosion because of plant rooting of soil and
have thicker soil development.
Soil drainage aects iron oxidation-reduction states, organic matter accumulation and preservation, and
local vegetation types. Well-drained soils, generally on hills or sideslopes, are more brownish or reddish due
to conversion of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to minerals with ferric (Fe3+) iron. More poorly drained soils, in lowland,
alluvial plains or upland depressions, tend more be more greyish, greenish-grey (gleyed), or dark colored, due
to iron reduction (to Fe2+) and accumulation and preservation of organic matter in areas tending towards
anoxic. Areas with poor drainage also tend to be lowlands into which soil material may wash and accumulate
from surrounding uplands, often resulting in overthickened A or O horizons. In contrast, steeply sloping
areas in highlands may experience erosion and have thinner surface horizons.
4.4.2.3.4 Parent Material
The parent material of a soil is the material from which the soil has developed, whether it be river sands, lake
clays, windblown loess, shoreline deposits, glacial deposits, or various types of bedrock. In youthful soils, the
parent material has a clear connection to the soil type and has signicant inuence. Over time, as weathering
processes deepen, mix, and alter the soil, the parent material becomes less recognizable as chemical, physical,
and biological processes take their eect. The type of parent material may also aect the rapidity of soil
development. Parent materials that are highly weatherable (such as volcanic ash) will transform more quickly
into highly developed soils, whereas parent materials that are quartz-rich, for example, will take longer to
develop. Parent materials also provide nutrients to plants and can aect soil internal drainage (e.g. clay is
more impermeable than sand and impedes drainage).
4.4.2.3.5 Time
In general, soil proles tend to become thicker (deeper), more developed, and more altered over time.
However, the rate of change is greater for soils in youthful stages of development. The degree of soil alteration
and deepening slows with time and at some point, after tens or hundreds of thousands of years, may approach
an equilibrium condition where erosion and deepening (removals and additions) become balanced. Young soils
(< 10,000 years old) are strongly inuenced by parent material and typically develop horizons and character
rapidly. Moderate age soils (roughly 10,000 to 500,000 years old) are slowing in prole development and
deepening, and may begin to approach equilibrium conditions. Old soils (>500,000 years old) have generally
reached their limit as far as soil horizonation and physical structure, but may continue to alter chemically
or mineralogically.
To be sure, soil development is not always continual. Geologic events can rapidly bury soils (landslides,
glacier advance, lake transgression), can cause removal or truncation of soils (rivers, shorelines) or can cause
soil renewal with additions of slowly deposited sediment that add to the soil (wind or oodplain deposits).
Biological mixing can sometimes cause soil regression, a reversal or bump in the road for the normal path of
increasing development over time.

4.4.3 Ecological and Societal Aspects of Soil
As the medium for native plant growth, agriculture, building construction, waste disposal, and a pathway for
groundwater inltration, soil plays an important role for many key activities of our society. Soil scientists,
agronomists, foresters, plant biologists, land-use planners, engineers, archeologists, and geologists, among
others, all consider soil type (composition, texture, structure, density, etc.) in many aspects of their research
or work. Below are some examples of the importance of soils in natural plant growth, in agriculture, and
related societal issues. The long-term sustainability of soil is vital to both human ecology, even in modern
society, and the ecology of our natural surroundings.
4.4.3.1 Soil-Plant Relations: Natural Processes
Soil plays a key role in plant growth. Benecial aspects to plants include providing physical support, heat,
water, nutrients, and oxygen. Heat, light, and oxygen are also obtained by the atmosphere, but the roots of
many plants also require oxygen. Elemental nutrients, dissolved in soil water solution, are derived from soil
minerals and organic material (see Figure Soil-Plant Nutrient Cycle (Figure 4.12)).

142 CHAPTER 4. BIOSPHERE
Plants mainly obtain nutrients from dissolved soil solutions. Though many aspects of soil are benecial
to plants, excessively high levels of trace metals (either naturally occurring or anthropogenically added) or
applied herbicides can be toxic to some plants.
The ratio of solids/water/air in soil is also critically important to plants for proper oxygenation levels
and water availability. Too much porosity with air space, such as in sandy or gravelly soils, can lead to
less available water to plants, especially during dry seasons when the water table is low. Too much water,
in poorly drained regions, can lead to anoxic conditions in the soil, which may be toxic to some plants.
Hydrophytic vegetation can handle anoxic conditions and is thus suitable to poorly drained soils in wetland
areas.
4.4.3.1.1 Nutrient Uptake by Plants
Several elements obtained from soil are considered essential for plant growth. Macronutrients, including
C, H, O, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S, are needed by plants in signicant quantities. C, H, and O are mainly
obtained from the atmosphere or from rainwater. These three elements are the main components of most
organic compounds, such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Oxygen generally serves as an
electron acceptor and is required by roots of many plants. The other six elements (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S)
are obtained by plant roots from the soil and are variously used for protein synthesis, chlorophyll synthesis,
energy transfer, cell division, enzyme reactions, and osmotic or ionic regulation.
Micronutrients are essential elements that are needed only in small quantities, but can still be limiting
to plant growth since these nutrients are not so abundant in nature. Micronutrients include iron (Fe),
manganese (Mn), boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), chlorine (Cl), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu). There are some
other elements that tend to aid plant growth but are not absolutely essential.
Micronutrients and macronutrients are desirable in particular concentrations and can be detrimental
to plant growth when concentrations in soil solution are either too low (limiting) or too high (toxicity).
Elemental nutrients are useful to plants only if they are in an extractable form in soil solutions, such as an
exchangeable cation, rather than in a solid mineral grain. As nutrients are used up in the microenvironment
surrounding a plant's roots, the replenishment of nutrients in soil solution is dependent on three aspects:
(a) the rate of dissolution/alteration of soil minerals into elemental constituents, (b) the release rate of
organically bound nutrients, and (c) the rate of diusion of nutrients through the soil solution to the area
of root uptake.
Many nutrients move through the soil and into the root system as a result of concentration gradients,
moving by diusion from high to low concentrations. However, some nutrients are selectively absorbed by the
root membranes, such that elemental concentrations of solutions within plants may dier from that in soil
solutions. Most nutrients exist as exchangeable cations that are acquired by roots from the soil solution
rather than from mineral or particle surfaces. Inorganic chemical processes and organic processes, such as
the action of soil microorganisms, can help to release elemental nutrients from mineral grains into the soil
environment.
4.4.3.2 Soil Health and Agricultural Impacts: Soil as a Sustainable Resource
4.4.3.2.1 Soil Health and Sustainability
Overall soil health can generally be dened as the capacity of the soil to function in a way that inltrates water
and cycles nutrients to support plant growth. Long term health of native soil is in many cases improved by
disturbing the soil less, growing a greater diversity of crops, maintaining living roots in the soil, and keeping
the soil covered with residue. Stable soil aggregates are important for soil health as they promote proper
inltration and thus limit the amount of water runo this has the added benet of reducing soil erosion
and downstream ooding and sedimentation.
Management of soil on farms may include use of tillage, fertilizer, pesticides, and other tools that may
improve soil health if used correctly; however, signicant damage to soil may result otherwise. Tillage with

143
a plow or disk is can be physically disruptive to soil fauna and microbes. The complex relations between
soil and plant life, which have evolved into a sustainable relationship in the natural world, can be disturbed
chemically by misuse or overuse of fertilizers or pesticides. Thus, to maintain soil health, one needs to
understand the chemical, biological, and physical processes that operate in the natural soil prole. To the
extent possible, we must work with the complexity of processes that function in a healthy soil and limit
our disturbances to only those that are clear, practical necessity. Biodiversity is another important aspect
to consider, because increasing the biodiversity of plants that are grown in soil can limit disease and pest
problems and allow for a better functioning food web. More diversity in plants above ground leads to more
diversity in the subsurface food web. Consequently, increasing the diversity of appropriate crop rotation in
agricultural lands can ultimately lead to better soil health and limit problems in the long run.
4.4.3.2.2 Agriculture and Food Capacity
Soils on arable lands globally are a resource to society with potential use for food production. Production is
ultimately limited by soil type, climate, hydrology, and land management. The native soil type is what has
been provided by the land, from centuries or millennia of soil development, typically under mostly natural
conditions under native plant vegetation. The eect of human populations may have been to drain land for
cultivation (aecting hydrology), to modify the landscape, build structures, and to remove native vegetation.
Some modications have aided with food production. Others have had unintended consequences of causing
land degradation, such as salinization, topsoil erosion, compaction, pollution, desertication, or depletion of
soil nutrients.
Some of these issues are of serious concern in developing countries where oversight and regulations
protecting the land may not be in place. For instance, overgrazing and rapid deforestation of the land,
and generally poor land management, can lower the organic matter content of surface soils, thus lowering
fertility and increasing the likelihood of topsoil erosion due to removal of the protective vegetative covering.
As the world's population continues to increase, we will need to nd ways to continually increase (or more
eectively utilize) food production capacity from an essentially xed amount of arable land worldwide. As
population density has increased, crop yields and the numbers of acres in production have been continually
increasing, with technological advances and more land in agriculture. This is not a sustainable trend, though,
since the land area on earth is nite. In fact, some prime farmland is even being removed from production in
developed countries as urbanization and land development occur on the ever-expanding edges of population
centers. Eorts will need to be made to preserve enough high yield farmland to be sustainable for future
generations.
4.4.3.2.3 Soil Compaction, Tillage, and Sustainable Practices
In modern agricultural practices, heavy machinery is used to prepare the seedbed, for planting, to control
weeds, and to harvest the crop. The use of heavy equipment has many advantages in saving time and labor,
but can cause compaction of soil and disruption of the natural soil biota. Much compaction is reversible
and some is unavoidable with modern practices; however, serious compaction issues can occur with excessive
passage of equipment during times when the soil has a high water content. The problem with soil compaction
is that increased soil density limits root penetration depth and may inhibit proper plant growth.
Current practices generally encourage minimal tillage or no tillage in order to reduce the number of trips
across the eld. With proper planning, this can simultaneously limit compaction, protect soil biota, reduce
costs (if performed correctly), promote water inltration, and help to prevent topsoil erosion (see below).
Tillage of elds does help to break up clods that were previously compacted, so best practices may vary at
sites with dierent soil textures and composition. Crop rotation can also help to reduce bulk density with
planting of crops with dierent root depth penetration. Another aspect of soil tillage is that it may lead
to more rapid decomposition of organic matter due to greater soil aeration. Over large areas of farmland,
this has the unintended consequence of releasing more carbon and nitrous oxides (greenhouse gases) into the
atmosphere, thereby contributing to global warming eects. In no-till farming, carbon can actually become

sequestered into the soil. Thus, no-till farming may be advantageous to sustainability issues on the local
scale and the global scale.
4.4.3.2.4 Soil Erosion
Accelerated erosion of topsoil due to human activities and poor agricultural land management is a potentially
serious issue. The areas most vulnerable to soil erosion include locations with thin organic (A and O) horizons
and hilly terrains (see Figure Water Erosion Vulnerability (Figure 4.13)).
Figure 4.13: Water Erosion Vulnerability. Figure shows a global map of soil erosion vulnerability
and includes a photograph of water and wind erosion. Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Resource Conservation Service21, Rodney Burton via Wikimedia Commons22, and Jim Bain via
Wikimedia Commons23
.
Some amount of soil erosion is a natural process along sloping areas and/or in areas with soft or noncohesive materials susceptible to movement by water, wind, or gravity. For instance, soil material can be
mobilized in strong windstorms, along the banks of rivers, in landslides, or by wave action along coastlines. Yet most topsoil erosion results from water inuenced processes such as in rivers, creeks, ravines,
small gullies, and overland ow or sheetwash from stormwater runo. Although some soil erosion is natural,
anthropogenic (human-induced) processes have greatly accelerated the erosion rate in many areas. Construction and agriculture are two of the more signicant activities in our modern society that have increased

145
erosion rates. In both cases, the erosion of topsoil can be signicant if poor land management practices are
used or if the area is geologically sensitive. For instance, in the 1930's, drought conditions and poor land
management methods (lack of cover crops and rotation) combined to result in severe wind erosion and dust
storms in the Great Plains of the United States, which came to be known as the Dust Bowl. Deep plowing
of soil and displacement of the original prairie grasses (that once held the soil together) also contributed to
the crisis. Once the natural topsoil is eroded by wind or water, it is only slowly renewable to its former
pre-eroded condition. It may take anywhere from several decades to hundreds of years to millennia, under
replanted native vegetation, to restore the soil to a relatively natural (pre-disturbed) state with its original
physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Furthermore, when soil is eroded, the particles become
sedimented downstream in streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. If rapid, this sedimentation can deteriorate
the water quality with sediment and agricultural chemicals. Better land management practices, such as more
limited tillage or no-till practices, can help to greatly limit soil erosion to a rate that is sustainable over the
long term. Practices today are somewhat improved overall, but more improvement in agricultural practices
are needed over large areas of farmland in the United States and other countries to bring us on a path to
long-term sustainability of agricultural lands.
Deforestation due to logging, construction, or increased re occurrences can also cause signicant increases
in soil erosion in many areas globally and may be a particular problem in developing countries. Removal of
the natural cover of vegetation enhances erosion since plant foliage tends to buer the intensity of rainfall and
roots hold soil together and prevent breakup and erosion. Furthermore, decomposing plant material provides
a protective cover of organic material on the soil surface. Watersheds with large areas of construction or
deforestation can experience several times the natural erosion rate. In such watersheds, streams can become
clogged with unwanted sediment that disturbs the natural ecosystem and inlls valuable wetland areas, in
addition to the problem of valuable topsoil loss from upland areas.
4.4.3.2.5 Fertilizer Runo, Ecological Eects, and Dead Zones
Nutrients in soil and water are generally benecial when they exist at naturally occurring levels. Nitrogen
fertilizers have been applied to farm elds for decades in order to maximize production of agricultural lands.
However, an unintended consequence is that the same nutrients can be detrimental to aquatic ecosystems
when introduced excessively for agricultural or other purposes. Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) are introduced by fertilizers that are used intensively in agriculture, as well as golf courses and some lawns and
gardens. Farm animal waste and sewage also provide large amounts of reactive N and P. Phosphorus was
formerly used heavily as an additive in laundry and dishwater detergents, but since the 1970's it has been
phased out in both through a combination of state and federal regulations. Overall, our modern society has
altered the global N and P cycles such that there is an overabundance in many settings.
Although atmospheric nitrogen gas is abundant, the gas is neither reactive nor utilized by most plants.
Reactive nitrogen, in nitrate and ammonia fertilizers, is utilized by plants at some rate. However, excessive
nutrients (not utilized) are often washed into drainage ways, streams, and rivers during rainfall and storm
events. High N and P levels in surface water runo have the eect of dramatically increasing algae growth
downstream due to eutrophic conditions. The algal blooms have the unwanted eect of strong decreases in
dissolved oxygen, which is needed for survival of sh and other aquatic life. Enhanced algae growth can thus
disrupt normal functioning of the ecosystem and cause what are known as "dead zones" (see Figure Aquatic
Dead Zones (Figure 4.14)). The waters may locally become cloudy and colored a shade of green, brown, or
red. Eutrophication can occur naturally, but it has been greatly enhanced due to the use of fertilizers. As a
result of eutrophication, many coastal waters contain increasingly problematic dead zones where major rivers
discharge nutrient-rich agricultural runo or poorly treated sewage and wastewater (e.g. Gulf of Mexico,
Chesapeake Bay, Baltic Sea, East China Sea) (see Figure Aquatic Dead Zones (Figure 4.14)). This issue is
of great importance because the dead zones are near inhabited coastlines with commercially and ecologically
vital aquatic life.

(hypoxia) zones, whereas the plain black dots are dead zones of unknown size. Darker blue colors show
high concentrations of particulate organic matter, an indication of overly fertile waters (high in N and
P). Most dead zones occur in downriver of agricultural areas (with overused fertilizer) or areas of high
population density with poorly treated wastewater. Source: NASA Earth Observatory via Wikimedia
Commons24 and Lamiot via Wikimedia Commons25
.
One of the most notorious dead zones (second to the Baltic Sea) is an 8,500 square mile region in the Gulf
of Mexico (see Figure Aquatic Dead Zones (Figure 4.14)). The Mississippi River dumps high-nutrient
runo from its drainage basin that includes vast agricultural lands in the American Midwest. Increased
algal growth produced by these nutrients has aected important shrimp shing grounds in the Gulf. The
primary source of the nutrients is the heavily tile-drained areas of farmland in the Midwest corn and soybean
belt (SW Minnesota, N Iowa, NE Illinois, N Indiana and NW Ohio). Improved soil drainage systems over
the past century or more have allowed for eective transport of nitrate compounds as stormwater runo
into drainage basins (Ohio River, Wabash River, Illinois River, Missouri River, etc.) that feed into the
Mississippi River. In other words, the same drainage tiles that allow for the agricultural benet of having
rich bottomland/wetland soils in production, have the disadvantage of increased and more rapid movements
of nitrate solutes to the Gulf of Mexico. Such large-scale problems, across state governmental boundaries,
can only be fully addressed in the future with a national system of incentives, regulations, or laws.
In addition to fertilizers, Nitrogen inputs to watersheds can also include atmospheric deposition, livestock waste, and sewage, but nitrogen fertilizers comprise a signicant majority of the input to monitored
streams, particularly in springtime when much fertilizer is applied. Possible solutions to this problem include
encouraging farmers to apply a more limited quantity of fertilizer in the spring (only as much as necessary),
rather than in the fall, to allow for considerably less time for stormwater or meltwater runo. Other solutions
include maintaining cover crops, or restoring wetlands in key locations to contain nitrate losses. An overall
strategy that limits the excess capacity of nutrients can simultaneously benet farmers (by limiting cost), the
ecology of stream watersheds and coastal ecosystems (also locally stressed by oil spills and other pollution).

Over the long term, more eorts will need to be made in the Mississippi River Basin, and globally in similarly
stressed agricultural or urban watersheds (see Figure Aquatic Dead Zones (Figure 4.14)), to improve the
health and sustainability of our soil, land, and aquatic ecosystems.

5.1 Physical Resources: Water, Pollution, and Minerals - Chapter
Introduction1
5.1.1 Introduction
Water, air, and food are the most important natural resources to people. Humans can live only a few minutes
without oxygen, about a week without water, and about a month without food. Water also is essential for
our oxygen and food supply. Plants, which require water to survive, provide oxygen through photosynthesis
and form the base of our food supply. Plants grow in soil, which forms by weathering reactions between
water and rock.
Water is the most essential compound for Earth's life in general. Human babies are approximately 75%
water and adults are 5060% water. Our brain is about 85% water, blood and kidneys are 83% water,
muscles are 76% water, and even bones are 22% water. We constantly lose water by perspiration; in
temperate climates we should drink about 2 quarts of water per day and people in hot desert climates should
drink up to 10 quarts of water per day. Loss of 15% of body-water usually causes death. Earth is truly the
Water Planet (see Figure Planet Earth from Space (Figure 5.1)). The abundance of water on Earth
distinguishes us from other bodies in the solar system. About 70% of Earth's surface is covered by oceans
and approximately half of Earth's surface is obscured by clouds at any time. There is a very large volume of
water on our planet, about 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (km3) (330 million cubic miles) or about 53 billion
gallons per person on Earth. All of Earth's water could cover the United States to a depth of 145 km (90
mi). From a human perspective, the problem is that over 97% of it is seawater, which is too salty to drink
or use for irrigation. The most commonly used water sources are rivers and lakes, which contain less than
0.01% of the world's water!

One of our most important environmental goals is to provide a clean, sucient, and sustainable water
supply for the world. Fortunately, water is a renewable resource, and it is dicult to destroy. Evaporation and
precipitation combine to replenish our fresh water supply constantly and quickly; however, water availability
is complicated by its uneven distribution over the Earth. Arid climate and densely populated areas have
combined in many parts of the world to create water shortages, which are projected to worsen signicantly
in the coming years. Human activities such as water overuse and water pollution have compounded the
water crisis that exists today. Hundreds of millions of people lack access to safe drinking water, and billions

of people lack access to improved sanitation as simple as a pit latrine. As a result, nearly two million people
die every year from diarrheal diseases and 90% of those deaths occur among children under the age of 5.
Most of these are easily prevented deaths.
Although few minerals are absolutely essential for human life, the things that dene modern society
require a wide range of them: iron ore for steel, phosphate minerals for fertilizer, limestone rock for concrete, rare earth elements for night-vision goggles and phosphors in computer monitors, and lithium minerals
for batteries in our laptops, cell phones, and electric cars. As global population grows and emerging large
economies expand, we will face a crisis in the supply of many important minerals because they are nonrenewable, which is to say we consume them far more quickly than nature creates them. As we consume
minerals from larger and lower grade mineral deposits there will be greater environmental impacts from
mineral mining and processing. The impending mineral crisis may be more challenging to address than the
water crisis.
This chapter introduces basic principles in water supply, water pollution, and mineral resources. The
emphasis, however, is on environmental issues and sustainable solutions for each problem.
5.2 Water Cycle and Fresh Water Supply3
5.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand how the water cycle operates
• understand the principles controlling groundwater resources and how they also can aect surface water
resources
• know the causes and eects of depletion in dierent water reservoirs
• understand how we can work toward solving the water supply crisis
5.2.2 Water Reservoirs and Water Cycle
Water is the only substance that occurs naturally on earth in three forms: solid, liquid and gas. It is
distributed in various locations, called water reservoirs. The oceans are by far the largest of the reservoirs
with about 97% of all water but that water is too saline for most human uses (see Figure Earth's Water
Reservoirs (Figure 5.2)). Ice caps and glaciers are the largest reservoirs of fresh water but this water is
inconveniently located, mostly in Antarctica and Greenland. Shallow groundwater is the largest reservoir of
usable fresh water. Although rivers and lakes are the most heavily used water resources, they represent only
a tiny amount of the world's water. If all of world's water was shrunk to the size of 1 gallon, then the total
amount of fresh water would be about 1/3 cup, and the amount of readily usable fresh water would be 2
tablespoons.

Water Resources
The water cycle shows the movement of water through dierent reservoirs, which include oceans, atmosphere, glaciers, groundwater, lakes, rivers, and biosphere (see Figure The Water Cycle (Figure 5.3)).
Solar energy and gravity drive the motion of water in the water cycle. Simply put, the water cycle involves
water moving from the ocean to the atmosphere by evaporation, forming clouds. From clouds, it falls as
precipitation (rain and snow) on both water and land, where it can move in a variety of ways. The water on
land can either return to the ocean by surface runo (unchannelized overland ow), rivers, glaciers, and
subsurface groundwater ow, or return to the atmosphere by evaporation or transpiration (loss of water
by plants to the atmosphere).

An important part of the water cycle is how water varies in salinity, which is the abundance of dissolved
ions in water. Ocean water is called salt water because it is highly saline, with about 35,000 mg of dissolved
ions per liter of seawater. Evaporation (where water changes from liquid to gas at ambient temperatures)
is a distillation process that produces nearly pure water with almost no dissolved ions. As water vaporizes, it
leaves the dissolved ions in the original liquid phase. Eventually, condensation (where water changes from
gas to liquid) forms clouds and sometimes precipitation (rain and snow). After rainwater falls onto land,
it dissolves minerals, which increases its salinity. Most lakes, rivers, and near-surface groundwater have a
relatively low salinity and are called fresh water. The next several sections discuss important parts of the
water cycle relative to fresh water resources.
5.2.3 Primary Fresh Water Resources: Precipitation
Precipitation is a major control of fresh water availability, and it is unevenly distributed around the globe
(see Figure World Rainfall Map (Figure 5.4)). More precipitation falls near the equator, and landmasses
there are characterized by a tropical rainforest climate. Less precipitation tends to fall near 2030 ◦ north and
south latitude, where the world's largest deserts are located. These rainfall and climate patterns are related
to global wind circulation cells. The intense sunlight at the equator heats air, causing it to rise and cool,

MINERALS
which decreases the ability of the air mass to hold water vapor and results in frequent rainstorms. Around
30 ◦ north and south latitude, descending air conditions produce warmer air, which increases its ability to
hold water vapor and results in dry conditions. Both the dry air conditions and the warm temperatures of
these latitude belts favor evaporation. Global precipitation and climate patterns are also aected by the size
of continents, major ocean currents, and mountains.
Figure 5.4: World Rainfall Map The false-color map above shows the amount of rain that falls around
the world. Areas of high rainfall include Central and South America, western Africa, and Southeast Asia.
Since these areas receive so much rainfall, they are where most of the world's rainforests grow. Areas with
very little rainfall usually turn into deserts. The desert areas include North Africa, the Middle East,
western North America, and Central Asia. Source: United States Geological Survey6 Earth Forum,

5.2.4 Surface Water Resources: Rivers, Lakes, Glaciers
Flowing water from rain and melted snow on land enters river channels by surface runo (see Figure Surface
Runo (Figure 5.5)) and groundwater seepage (see Figure Groundwater Seepage (Figure 5.6)). River
discharge describes the volume of water moving through a river channel over time (see Figure River
Discharge (Figure 5.7)). The relative contributions of surface runo vs. groundwater seepage to river
discharge depend on precipitation patterns, vegetation, topography, land use, and soil characteristics. Soon
after a heavy rainstorm, river discharge increases due to surface runo. The steady normal ow of river
water is mainly from groundwater that discharges into the river. Gravity pulls river water downhill toward
the ocean. Along the way the moving water of a river can erode soil particles and dissolve minerals, creating

155
the river's load of moving sediment grains and dissolved ions. Groundwater also contributes a large amount
of the dissolved ions in river water. The geographic area drained by a river and its tributaries is called a
drainage basin. The Mississippi River drainage basin includes approximately 40% of the U.S., a measure
that includes the smaller drainage basins (also called watersheds), such as the Ohio River and Missouri
River that help to comprise it. Rivers are an important water resource for irrigation and many cities around
the world. Some of the world's rivers that have had international disputes over water supply include the
Colorado (Mexico, southwest U.S.), Nile (Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan), Euphrates (Iraq, Syria, Turkey), Ganges
(Bangladesh, India), and Jordan (Israel, Jordan, Syria).

Lakes can also be an excellent source of fresh water for human use. They usually receive water from
surface runo and groundwater discharge. They tend to be short-lived on a geological time-scale because
they are constantly lling in with sediment supplied by rivers. Lakes form in a variety of ways including
glaciation (Great Lakes, North America, See Figure Great Lakes from Space (Figure 5.8)), recent tectonic
uplift (Lake Tanganyika, Africa), and volcanic eruptions (Crater Lake, Oregon). People also create articial
lakes (reservoirs) by damming rivers. Large changes in climate can result in major changes in a lake's size.
As Earth was coming out of the last Ice Age about fteen thousand years ago, the climate in the western
U.S. changed from cool and moist to warm and arid, which caused more than100 large lakes to disappear.
The Great Salt Lake in Utah is a remnant of a much larger lake called Lake Bonneville.

Although glaciers represent the largest reservoir of fresh water, they generally are not used as a water
source because they are located too far from most people (see Figure Mountain Glacier in Argentina
(Figure 5.9)). Melting glaciers do provide a natural source of river water and groundwater. During the last
Ice Age there was as much as 50% more water in glaciers than there is today, which caused sea level to be
about 100 m lower. Over the past century, sea level has been rising in part due to melting glaciers. If Earth's
climate continues to warm, the melting glaciers will cause an additional rise in sea level.

5.2.5 Groundwater Resources
Although most people in the U.S. and the world use surface water, groundwater is a much larger reservoir of
usable fresh water, containing more than 30 times more water than rivers and lakes combined. Groundwater
is a particularly important resource in arid climates, where surface water may be scarce. In addition,
groundwater is the primary water source for rural homeowners, providing 98% of that water demand in
the U.S.. Groundwater is water located in small spaces, called pore space, between mineral grains and
fractures in subsurface earth materials (rock or sediment, i.e., loose grains). Groundwater is not located in
underground rivers or lakes except where there are caves, which are relatively rare. Between the land surface
and the depth where there is groundwater is the unsaturated zone, where pore spaces contain only air and
water lms on mineral grains (see Figure Subsurface Water Terminology (Figure 5.10)).12 Below the
unsaturated zone is the saturated zone, where groundwater completely lls pore spaces in earth materials.
The interface between the unsaturated zone and saturated zone is the water table. Most groundwater
originates from rain or snowmelt, which inltrates the ground and moves downward until it reaches the
11http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Perito_Moreno_Glacier_Patagonia_Argentina_Luca_Galuzzi_2005.JPG
12Groundwater is the name for water in the saturated zone and soil moisture describes water in the unsaturated zone.
Therefore, groundwater is the underground water resource used by society but soil moisture is the principal water supply for
most plants and is an important factor in agricultural productivity.

MINERALS
saturated zone. Other sources of groundwater include seepage from surface water (lakes, rivers, reservoirs,
and swamps), surface water deliberately pumped into the ground, irrigation, and underground wastewater
treatment systems, i.e., septic tanks. Recharge areas are locations where surface water inltrates the
ground rather than running o into rivers or evaporating. Wetlands and at vegetated areas in general are
excellent recharge areas.

materials, saturated zone, unsaturated zone, and water table, which follows land surface but in a more
subdued way. Source: United States Geological Survey13
Groundwater is in constant motion due to interconnection between pore spaces. Porosity is the percentage of pore space in an earth material and it gives a measure of how much groundwater an earth material
can hold. Permeability is a measure of the speed that groundwater can ow through an earth material,
and it depends on the size and degree of interconnection among pores. An earth material that is capable
of supplying groundwater from a well at a useful ratei.e., it has relatively high permeability and medium
to high porosityis called an aquifer. Examples of aquifers are earth materials with abundant, large,
well-connected pore spaces such as sand, gravel, uncemented sandstone, and any highly fractured rock. An
earth material with low hydraulic conductivity is an aquitard. Examples of aquitards include clay, shale
(sedimentary rock with abundant clay), and igneous and metamorphic rock, if they contain few fractures.
As discussed above, groundwater ows because most earth materials near the surface have nite (nonzero)
porosity and permeability values. Another reason for groundwater movement is that the surface of the
water table commonly is not completely at but mimics the topography of the land surface, especially
in humid climates. There is "topography" to the water table because groundwater moves slowly through
rock and soil, so it builds up in higher elevation areas. In fact, when groundwater ows slowly through
13http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/gwhowtond.html

161
aquitards and deep underground, it can take many thousands of years to move relatively short distances. An
unconned aquifer has no aquitard above it and, therefore, it is exposed to the atmosphere and surface
waters through interconnected pores (See Figure Flowing Groundwater (Figure 5.11)). In an unconned
aquifer, groundwater ows because of gravity to lower water table levels, where it eventually may discharge
or leave the groundwater ow system. Discharge areas include rivers, lakes, swamps, reservoirs, water wells,
and springs (see Figure Fatzael Springs in Jordan Valley (Figure 5.12)). Springs are rivers that emerge
from underground due to an abrupt intersection of the land surface and the water table caused by joints,
caves, or faults that bring permeable earth materials to the surface. A conned aquifer is bounded by
aquitards below and above, which prevents recharge from the surface immediately above. Instead, the major
recharge occurs where the conned aquifer intercepts the land surface, which may be a long distance from
water wells and discharge areas (see Figure Schematic Cross Section of Aquifer Types (Figure 5.13)).
Conned aquifers are commonly inclined away from recharge areas, so groundwater in a conned aquifer
is under greater-than-atmospheric pressure due to the weight of water in the upslope direction. Similar
to river discharge, groundwater discharge describes the volume of water moving through an aquifer over
time. Total groundwater discharge depends on the permeability of the earth material, the pressure that
drives groundwater ow, and the size of the aquifer. It is important to determine groundwater discharge to
evaluate whether an aquifer can meet the water needs of an area.

aquifers, conned aquifers, and conning beds. Deep groundwater moves very slowly especially through
low permeability layers.Source: United States Geological Survey14

line) due to extra pressure on groundwater in conned aquifer. Water in owing artesian well moves

Most shallow water wells are drilled into unconned aquifers. These are called water table wells because
the water level in the well coincides with the water table (See Figure Schematic Cross Section of Aquifer
Types (Figure 5.13)). 90% of all aquifers for water supply are unconned aquifers composed of sand or
gravel. To produce water from a well, you simply need to drill a hole that reaches the saturated zone and
then pump water to the surface. Attempting to pump water from the unsaturated zone is like drinking root
beer with a straw immersed only in the foam at the top.
To nd a large aquifer for a city, hydrogeologists (geologists who specialize in groundwater) use a variety
of information including knowledge of earth materials at the surface and sub-surface as well as test wells.
Some people search for water by dowsing, where someone holds a forked stick or wire (called a divining rod)
while walking over an area. The stick supposedly rotates or deects downward when the dowser passes over
water. Controlled tests show that a dowser's success is equal to or less than random chance. Nevertheless,
in many areas water wells are still drilled on dowser's advice sometimes for considerable money. There is no
scientic basis to dowsing.
Wells into conned aquifers typically are deeper than those into unconned aquifers because they must
penetrate a conning layer. The water level in a well drilled into a conned aquifer, which is an artesian
well, (see Figure Schematic Cross Section of Aquifer Types (Figure 5.13)), moves above the local

166 CHAPTER 5. PHYSICAL RESOURCES: WATER, POLLUTION, AND

A conned aquifer tends to be depleted from groundwater pumping more quickly than an unconned
aquifer, assuming similar aquifer properties and precipitation levels. This is because conned aquifers have
smaller recharge areas, which may be far from the pumping well. Conversely, an unconned aquifer tends to
be more susceptible to pollution because it is hydrologically connected to the surface, which is the source of
most pollution.
Groundwater and surface water (rivers, lakes, swamps, and reservoirs) are strongly interrelated because
both are part of the same overall resource. Major groundwater removal (from pumping or drought) can lower
the levels of surface water and vice versa. We can dene two types of streams: gaining (euent) streams
and losing (inuent) streams (see Figure Interaction of Streams and Ground Water (Figure 5.15)).
Gaining streams tend to be perennial (ow year round), are characteristic of humid climates, have the water
table sloping towards the river, and therefore gain water from groundwater discharge. Losing streams tend
to be ephemeral (ow only after signicant rain), are characteristic of arid climates, are located above the
water table (which slopes away from the river), and therefore lose water to groundwater recharge. Pollution
that is dumped into a losing stream will tend to move into the ground and could also contaminate local
groundwater.

MINERALS
5.2.6 Water Use in the U.S. and World
People need water to produce the food, energy, and mineral resources they usecommonly large amounts
of it. Consider, for example, these approximate water requirements for some things people in the developed
world use every day: one tomato = 3 gallons; one kilowatt-hour of electricity (from a thermoelectric power
plant) = 21 gallons; one loaf of bread = 150 gallons; one pound of beef = 1,600 gallons; and one ton of steel
= 63,000 gallons. Human beings require only about 1 gallon per day to survive, but a typical person in a
U.S. household uses approximately 100 gallons per day, which includes cooking, washing dishes and clothes,
ushing the toilet, and bathing.
The water demand of an area is a function of the population and other uses of water. There are several general categories of water use, including ostream use, which removes water from its source, e.g.,
irrigation, thermoelectric power generation (cooling electricity-producing equipment in fossil fuel, nuclear,
and geothermal power plants), industry, and public supply; consumptive use, which is a type of ostream
use where water does not return to the surface water or groundwater system immediately after use, e.g.,
irrigation water that evaporates or goes to plant growth; and instream use, which is water used but not
removed from a river, mostly for hydroelectric power generation. The relative size of these three categories
are instream use  ostream use > consumptive use. In 2005, the U.S. used approximately 3,300 billion
gallons per day for instream use, 410 billion gallons per day for ostream use, and 100 billion gallons per day
for consumptive use. The major ostream uses of that water were thermoelectric (49%), irrigation (31%),
public supply (11%), and industry (4%, see Figure Trends in Total Water Withdrawals by Water-use
Category, 1950-2005 (Figure 5.16)). About 15% of the total water withdrawals in the U.S. in 2005 were
saline water, which was used almost entirely for thermoelectric power generation. Almost all of the water
used for thermoelectric power generation is returned to the river, lake, or ocean from where it came but about
half of irrigation water does not return to the original source due to evaporation, plant transpiration, and
loss during transport, e.g., leaking pipes. Total withdrawals of water in the U.S. actually decreased slightly
from 1980 to 2005, despite a steadily increasing population. This is because the two largest categories of
water use (thermoelectric and irrigation) stabilized or decreased over that time period due to better water
management and conservation. In contrast, public supply water demand increased steadily from 1950 (when
estimates began) through 2005. Approximately 77% of the water for ostream use in the U.S. in 2005 came
from surface water and the rest was from groundwater (see Figure Trends in Source of Fresh Water
Withdrawals in the U.S. from 1950 to 2005 (Figure 5.17)).

In contrast to trends in the U.S., global total water use is steadily increasing at a rate greater than world
population growth (see Figure Trends in World Water Use from 1900 to 2000 and Projected to
2025 (Figure 5.18)). During the twentieth century global population tripled and water demand grew by a
factor of six. The increase in global water demand beyond the rate of population growth is due to improved
standard of living without an oset by water conservation. Increased production of goods and energy entails
a large increase in water demand. The major global ostream water uses are irrigation (68%), public supply
(21%), and industry (11%).

5.2.7 Water Supply Problems: Resource Depletion
As groundwater is pumped from water wells, there usually is a localized drop in the water table around the
well called a cone of depression (see Figure Formation of a Cone of Depression around a Pumping
Water Well (Figure 5.19)). When there are a large number of wells that have been pumping water for
a long time, the regional water table can drop signicantly. This is called groundwater mining, which
can force the drilling of deeper, more expensive wells that commonly encounter more saline groundwater.

172 CHAPTER 5. PHYSICAL RESOURCES: WATER, POLLUTION, AND
MINERALS
The occurrence of mining does not mean that groundwater will never be recharged, but in many cases the
recharge rate is negligible on a human time-scale. Conned aquifers are more susceptible to groundwater
mining due to their limited recharge areas. Urban development usually worsens groundwater mining because
natural recharge rates drop with the proliferation of impermeable pavement, buildings, and roads. Extensive
groundwater pumping around Chicago has created a gigantic cone of depression there. Because the water
table dropped up to 250 m (800 ft) in the area (see Figure Drop in Water Table in a Conned Aquifer
in the Area of Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. from 1864 - 1980 (Figure 5.20)),
many local public water suppliers have switched to Lake Michigan water. Chicago is fortunate to have a large
alternate supply of fresh water; many arid locations don't have that luxury. Other places where groundwater
mining is a serious problem include the High Plains (Ogallala Aquifer) and the Desert Southwest of the U.S.,
Mexico, the Middle East, India, and China. Rivers, lakes, and articial lakes (reservoirs) can also be depleted
due to overuse. Some large rivers, such as the Colorado in the U.S. and Yellow in China, run dry in some
years. The case history of the Aral Sea discussed below involves depletion of a lake. Finally, glaciers are
being depleted due to accelerated melting associated with global warming over the past century.

174 CHAPTER 5. PHYSICAL RESOURCES: WATER, POLLUTION, AND
MINERALS
Another water resource problem associated with groundwater mining is saltwater intrusion, where
overpumping of fresh water aquifers near ocean coastlines causes saltwater to enter fresh water zones. Saltwater intrusion is a signicant problem in many coastal areas of the U.S. including Long Island, New York;
Cape Cod, Massachusetts; and southeastern and Gulf Coastal states. The drop of the water table around a
cone of depression in an unconned aquifer can change the regional groundwater ow direction, which could
send nearby pollution toward the pumping well instead of away from it. Finally, problems of subsidence
(gradual sinking of the land surface over a large area) and sinkholes (rapid sinking of the land surface over
a small area) can develop due to a drop in the water table.
5.2.8 The Water Supply Crisis
The water crisis refers to a global situation where people in many areas lack access to sucient water or
clean water or both. This section describes the global situation involving water shortages, also called water
stress. The next section covers the water crisis involving water pollution. Figure Countries Facing Water
Stress in 1995 and Projected in 2025 (Figure 5.21) shows areas of the world experiencing water stress
as dened by a high percentage of water withdrawal compared to total available water. Due to population
growth the 2025 projection for global water stress is signicantly worse than water stress levels in 1995.
In general, water stress is greatest in areas with very low precipitation (major deserts) or large population
density (e.g., India) or both. Future global warming could worsen the water crisis by shifting precipitation
patterns away from humid areas and by melting mountain glaciers that recharge rivers downstream. Melting
glaciers will also contribute to rising sea level, which will worsen saltwater intrusion in aquifers near ocean
coastlines. Compounding the water crisis is the issue of social injustice; poor people generally get less access
to clean water and commonly pay more for water than wealthy people.

(11% of the world's population) lived under water stress with a per capita water supply below 1,700 m3/year25
(Watkins, 2006 (p. 179)). Most of them live in the Middle East and North Africa. By 2025, the report
projects that more than 3 billion people (about 40% of the world's population) will live in water-stressed
areas with the large increase coming mainly from China and India. The water crisis will also impact food
production and our ability to feed the ever-growing population. We can expect future global tension and
even conict associated with water shortages and pollution. Historic and future areas of water conict
include the Middle East (Euphrates and Tigris River conict among Turkey, Syria, and Iraq; Jordan River
conict among Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinian territories), Africa (Nile River conict among
Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan), Central Asia (Aral Sea conict among Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan), and south Asia (Ganges River conict between India and Pakistan).
5.2.9 Sustainable Solutions to the Water Supply Crisis?
The current and future water crisis described above requires multiple approaches to extending our fresh
water supply and moving towards sustainability. Some of the longstanding traditional approaches include
dams and aqueducts. Reservoirs that form behind dams in rivers can collect water during wet times and
store it for use during dry spells (see Figure Hoover Dam, Nevada, U.S. (Figure 5.22)). They also can
be used for urban water supplies. New York City has a large number of reservoirs and controlled lakes up to
200 km away to meet the water demands of its large population. Other benets of dams and reservoirs are
hydroelectricity, ood control, and recreation. Some of the drawbacks are evaporative loss of reservoir water
in arid climates, downstream river channel erosion, and impact on the ecosystem including a change from
a river to lake habitat and interference with sh migration and spawning. Aqueducts can move water from
where it is plentiful to where it is needed (see Figure The California Aqueduct (Figure 5.23)). Southern
California has a large and controversial network of aqueducts that brings in water from the Sierra Nevada
Mountains in the north, the valleys in northern and central California, and the Colorado River to the east
(see Figure Map of California Aqueducts (Figure 5.24)). Aqueducts can be controversial and politically
dicult especially if the water transfer distances are large. One drawback is the water diversion can cause
drought in the area from where the water is drawn. For example, Owens Lake and Mono Lake in central
California began to disappear after their river inow was diverted to the Los Angeles aqueduct. Owens Lake
remains almost completely dry, but Mono Lake has recovered more signicantly due to legal intervention.
25Although 1,700 m3/year sounds like a lot of water for every person, it is the minimum amount that hydrologists consider
is needed to grow food, support industry, and maintain the environment in general.

The Colorado River, probably the most exploited river in the U.S., has many dams, some huge reservoirs,
and several large aqueducts so that it can provide large amounts of fresh water to 7 states in the arid
southwestern U.S. and Mexico. The primary use for the water is for a few large cities (Las Vegas, Phoenix,
and Tuscon) and irrigation. Allocation of Colorado River water is strictly regulated. Fortunately, not all
28http://www.centralbasin.org/waterSupplySystem.html

179
states use all of their water allocation because the total amount of allocated water is more than the typical
Colorado River discharge. Colorado River water gets so saline due to evaporation along its course that
the U.S. was forced to build a desalination plant near the border with Mexico so that it could be used for
drinking and irrigation. The wetlands of the Colorado River delta and its associated ecosystem have been
sadly degraded by the water overuse; some years, no river ow even reaches the ocean.
One method that actually can increase the amount of fresh water on Earth is desalination, which
involves removing dissolved salt from seawater or saline groundwater. There are several ways to desalinate
seawater including boiling, ltration, electrodialysis, and freezing. All of these procedures are moderately
to very expensive and require considerable energy input, making the produced water much more expensive
than fresh water from conventional sources. In addition, the processes create highly saline wastewater, which
must be disposed of. Desalination is most common in the Middle East, where energy from oil is abundant
but water is scarce.
Conservation means using less water and using it more eciently. Around the home, conservation can
involve both engineered features, such as high-eciency clothes washers and low-ow showers and toilets, as
well as behavioral decisions, such as growing native vegetation that require little irrigation in desert climates,
turning o the water while you brush your teeth, and xing leaky faucets. Rainwater harvesting involves
catching and storing rainwater for reuse before it reaches the ground. Ecient irrigation is extremely
important because irrigation accounts for a much larger water demand than public water supply. Water
conservation strategies in agriculture include growing crops in areas where the natural rainfall can support
them, more ecient irrigation systems such as drip systems that minimize losses due to evaporation, no-till
farming that reduces evaporative losses by covering the soil, and reusing treated wastewater from sewage
treatment plants. Recycled wastewater has also been used to recharge aquifers. There are a great many
other specic water conservation strategies. Sustainable solutions to the water crisis must use a variety of
approaches but they should have water conservation as a high priority.

5.3 Case Study: The Aral Sea - Going, Going, Gone30
The Aral Sea is a lake located east of the Caspian Sea between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in central Asia
(see Figure Map of Aral Sea Area (Figure 5.25)). This area is part of the Turkestan desert, which is the
fourth largest desert in the world; it is produced from a rain shadow eect by Afghanistan's high mountains

to the south. Due to the arid and seasonally hot climate there is extensive evaporation and limited surface
waters in general. Summer temperatures can reach 60 ◦ C (140 ◦ F)! The water supply to the Aral Sea is
mainly from two rivers, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which carry snowmelt from mountainous areas. In
the early 1960s the then-Soviet Union diverted the Amu Darya and Syr Darya Rivers for irrigation of one of
the driest parts of Asia to produce rice, melons, cereals, and especially cotton. The Soviets wanted cotton
or white gold to become a major export. They were successful and today Uzbekistan is one of the world's
largest exporters of cotton. Unfortunately this action essentially eliminated any river inow to the Aral Sea
and caused it to disappear almost completely.

In 1960 Aral Sea was the fourth largest inland water body; only the Caspian Sea, Lake Superior, and
Lake Victoria were larger. Since then, it has progressively shrunk due to evaporation and lack of recharge
by rivers (see Figure Shrinking Aral Sea Blue (Figure 5.26)). Before 1965 the Aral Sea received 2060
km3 of fresh water per year from rivers and by the early 1980s it received none. By 2007 the Aral Sea
shrank to about 10% of its original size and its salinity increased from about 1% dissolved salt to about 10%
dissolved salt, which is 3 times more saline than seawater. These changes caused an enormous environmental
impact. A once thriving shing industry is dead as are the 24 species of sh that used to live there; the sh
could not adapt to the more saline waters. The current shoreline is tens of kilometers from former shing

towns and commercial ports. Large shing boats lie in the dried up lakebed of dust and salt (see Figure
An Abandoned Ship (Figure 5.27)). A frustrating part of the river diversion project is that many of the
irrigation canals were poorly built, allowing abundant water to leak or evaporate. An increasing number of
dust storms blow salt, pesticides, and herbicides into nearby towns causing a variety of respiratory illnesses
including tuberculosis.

The wetlands of the two river deltas and their associated ecosystems have disappeared. The regional
climate is drier and has greater temperature extremes due to the absence of moisture and moderating
inuence from the lake. In 2003 some lake restoration work began on the northern part of the Aral Sea
and it provided some relief by raising water levels and reducing salinity somewhat. The southern part of
the Aral Sea has seen no relief and remains nearly completely dry. The destruction of the Aral Sea is one
of the planet's biggest environmental disasters and it is caused entirely by humans. Lake Chad in Africa is
another example of a massive lake that has nearly disappeared for the same reasons as the Aral Sea. Aral
Sea and Lake Chad are the most extreme examples of large lakes destroyed by unsustainable diversions of
river water. Other lakes that have shrunk signicantly due to human diversions of water include the Dead
Sea in the Middle East, Lake Manchar in Pakistan, and Owens Lake and Mono Lake, both in California.

5.4 Water Pollution34
5.4.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the major kinds of water pollutants and how they degrade water quality
• understand how and why the lack of safe drinking water in some parts of the world is a major problem
• know what sewage treatment does and why it is important
• know why it is more dicult to remediate groundwater pollution than surface water pollution
• understand how we can work toward solving the crisis involving water pollution
5.4.2 The Water Pollution Crisis
The Module Water Cycle and Fresh Water Supply (Section 5.2) described one aspect of the global water
crisis, the water shortages that aict many arid and densely populated areas. The global water crisis also
involves water pollution, because to be useful for drinking and irrigation, water must not be polluted beyond
certain thresholds. According to the World Health Organization, in 2008 approximately 880 million people
in the world (or 13% of world population) did not have access to improved (safe) drinking water (World
Health Statistics, 2010 (p. 209)) (See Figure Proportion of Population by Country Using Improved
Drinking Water Sources in 2008 (Figure 5.28)). At the same time, about 2.6 billion people (or 40% of
world population) lived without improved sanitation (see Figure Proportion of Population by Country
Using Improved Sanitation Facilities in 2008 (Figure 5.29)), which is dened as having access to a
public sewage system, septic tank, or even a simple pit latrine. Each year approximately 1.7 million people
die from diarrheal diseases associated with unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene,
e.g., hand washing with soap. Almost all of these deaths are in developing countries, and around 90% of
them occur among children under the age of 5 (see Figure Deaths by Country from Diarrhea Caused
by Unsafe Water, Unimproved Sanitation, and Poor Hygiene in Children Less than 5 Years
Old, 2004 (Figure 5.30)). Compounding the water crisis is the issue of social justice; poor people more
commonly lack clean water and sanitation than wealthy people in similar areas. Globally, improving water,
sanitation, and hygiene could prevent up to 9% of all disease and 6% of all deaths. In addition to the global
waterborne disease crisis, chemical pollution from agriculture, industry, cities, and mining threatens global
water quality. Some chemical pollutants have serious and well-known health eects; however, many others
have poorly known long-term health eects. In the U.S. currently more than 40,000 water bodies t the
denition of impaired set by EPA (See Figure Percentage of Impaired Water Bodies in a Watershed
by State in USA Based on US EPA Data in 2000 (Figure 5.31)), which means they could neither
support a healthy ecosystem nor meet water quality standards. In Gallup public polls conducted over the
past decade Americans consistently put water pollution and water supply as the top environmental concerns
over issues such as air pollution, deforestation, species extinction, and global warming.

5.4.3 Water Chemistry Overview
Compared to other molecules of similar molecular weight, water (H2O) has unique physical properties including high values for melting and boiling point, surface tension (water's cohesion, or stickiness), and
capacity to dissolve soluble minerals, i.e., act as a solvent. These properties are related to its asymmetrical
structure and polar nature, which means it is electrically neutral overall but it has a net positive charge on
the side with the two hydrogen atoms and a net negative charge on the oxygen side (see Figure Structure of
Water, Polar Charge of Water, and Hydrogen Bonds between Water Molecules (Figure 5.32)).
This separation of the electrical charge within a water molecule results in hydrogen bonds with other water
molecules, mineral surfaces (hydrogen bonding produces the water lms on minerals in the unsaturated zone
of the subsurface), and dissolved ions (atoms with a negative or positive charge). Many minerals and pollutants dissolve readily in water because water forms hydration shells (spheres of loosely coordinated, oriented
water molecules) around ions.

Any natural water contains dissolved chemicals; some of these are important human nutrients, while
others can be harmful to human health. The abundance of a water pollutant is commonly given in very
small concentration units such as parts per million (ppm) or even parts per billion (ppb). An arsenic
concentration of 1 ppm means 1 part of arsenic per million parts of water. This is equivalent to one drop of
arsenic in 50 liters of water. To give you a dierent perspective on appreciating small concentration units,
converting 1 ppm to length units is 1 cm (0.4 in) in 10 km (6 miles) and converting 1 ppm to time units is 30
seconds in a year. Total dissolved solids (TDS) represent the total amount of dissolved material in water.
Average TDS (salinity) values for rainwater, river water, and seawater are about 4 ppm, 120 ppm, and 35,000
ppm. As discussed in Module Climate Processes; External and Internal Controls (Section 3.2), the

MINERALS
most important processes that aect the salinity of natural waters are evaporation, which distills nearly pure
water and leaves the dissolved ions in the original water, and chemical weathering, which involves mineral
dissolution that adds dissolved ions to water. Fresh water is commonly dened as containing less than either
1,000 or 500 ppm TDS, but the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that drinking
water not exceed 500 ppm TDS or else it will have an unpleasant salty taste.
5.4.4 Water Pollution Overview
Water pollution is the contamination of water by an excess amount of a substance that can cause harm to
human beings and the ecosystem. The level of water pollution depends on the abundance of the pollutant, the
ecological impact of the pollutant, and the use of the water. Pollutants are derived from biological, chemical,
or physical processes. Although natural processes such as volcanic eruptions or evaporation sometimes
can cause water pollution, most pollution is derived from human, land-based activities (see Figure Water
Pollution (Figure 5.33)). Water pollutants can move through dierent water reservoirs, as the water
carrying them progresses through stages of the water cycle (see Figure Sources of Water Contamination
(Figure 5.34)). Water residence time (the average time that a water molecule spends in a water reservoir) is
very important to pollution problems because it aects pollution potential. Water in rivers has a relatively
short residence time, so pollution usually is there only briey. Of course, pollution in rivers may simply
move to another reservoir, such as the ocean, where it can cause further problems. Groundwater is typically
characterized by slow ow and longer residence time, which can make groundwater pollution particularly
problematic. Finally, pollution residence time can be much greater than the water residence time because a
pollutant may be taken up for a long time within the ecosystem or absorbed onto sediment.

Pollutants enter water supplies from point sources, which are readily identiable and relatively small
locations, or nonpoint sources, which are large and more diuse areas. Point sources of pollution include
animal factory farms that raise a large number and high density of livestock such as cows, pigs, and chickens
(see Figure A Commercial Meat Chicken Production House (Figure 5.35)) and discharge pipes from
a factories or sewage treatment plants. Combined sewer systems that have a single set of underground
pipes to collect both sewage and storm water runo from streets for wastewater treatment can be major point
sources of pollutants. During heavy rain, storm water runo may exceed sewer capacity, causing it to back
up and spilling untreated sewage into surface waters (see Figure Combined Sewer System (Figure 5.36)).
Nonpoint sources of pollution include agricultural elds, cities, and abandoned mines. Rainfall runs over
the land and through the ground, picking up pollutants such as herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizer from
agricultural elds and lawns; oil, antifreeze, car detergent, animal waste, and road salt from urban areas; and
acid and toxic elements from abandoned mines. Then, this pollution is carried into surface water bodies and
groundwater. Nonpoint source pollution, which is the leading cause of water pollution in the U.S., is usually
much more dicult and expensive to control than point source pollution because of its low concentration,
multiple sources, and much greater volume of water.

5.4.5 Types of Water Pollutants
Oxygen-demanding waste is an extremely important pollutant to ecosystems. Most surface water in
contact with the atmosphere has a small amount of dissolved oxygen, which is needed by aquatic organisms
for cellular respiration. Bacteria decompose dead organic matter (chemically represented in a simplied way
as CH2O) and remove dissolved oxygen (O2) according to the following reaction:
CH2O + O2 → CO2 + H2O (5.36)
Too much decaying organic matter in water is a pollutant because it removes oxygen from water, which
can kill sh, shellsh, and aquatic insects. The amount of oxygen used by aerobic (in the presence of
oxygen) bacterial decomposition of organic matter is called biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The
major source of dead organic matter in most natural waters is sewage; grass and leaves are smaller sources.
An unpolluted water body with respect to oxygen is a turbulent river that ows through a natural forest.
Turbulence continually brings water in contact with the atmosphere where the O2 content is restored. The
dissolved oxygen content in such a river ranges from 10 to 14 ppm O2, BOD is low, and clean-water sh,
e.g., bass, trout, and perch dominate. A polluted water body with respect to oxygen is a stagnant deep lake
in an urban setting with a combined sewer system. This system favors a high input of dead organic carbon
from sewage overows and limited chance for water circulation and contact with the atmosphere. In such a
lake, the dissolved O2 content is ≤5 ppm O2, BOD is high, and low O2-tolerant sh, e.g., carp and catsh
dominate.
Excessive plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), are pollutants closely related to oxygen-demanding waste. Aquatic plants require about 15 nutrients for growth, most of which are
plentiful in water. N and P are called limiting nutrients, because they usually are present in water at low

concentrations and therefore restrict the total amount of plant growth. This explains why N and P are major ingredients in most fertilizer. High concentrations of N and P from human sources (mostly agricultural
and urban runo including fertilizer, sewage, and P-based detergent) can cause cultural eutrophication,
which involves the rapid growth of aquatic plants, particularly algae, called an algal bloom. Thick mats of
oating and rooted green or sometimes red algae (see Figure Algal Bloom in River in Sichuan, China
(Figure 5.37)) create water pollution, damage the ecosystem by clogging sh gills and blocking sunlight,
and damage lake aesthetics by making recreation dicult and creating an eyesore. A small percentage of
algal species produce toxins that can kill sh, mammals, and birds, and may cause human illness; explosive
growths of these algae are called harmful algal blooms (see Figure Harmful Algal Bloom (Figure 5.38)).
When the prolic algal layer dies, it becomes oxygen-demanding waste, which can create very low O2 water
(<∼2 ppm O2), called hypoxia or dead zone because it causes death to organisms that are unable to leave
that environment. An estimated 50% of lakes in North America, Europe, and Asia are negatively impacted
by cultural eutrophication. In addition, the size and number of marine hypoxic zones have grown dramatically over the past 50 years (see Figure Aquatic Dead Zones (Figure 5.39)), including a very large dead
zone located oshore Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. Cultural eutrophication and hypoxia are dicult to
combat, because they are caused primarily by nonpoint source pollution, which is dicult to regulate, and
N and P, which are dicult to remove from wastewater.

Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, e.g., viruses, bacteria, parasitic worms, and protozoa,
which cause a variety of intestinal diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and cholera. Pathogens
are the major cause of the water pollution crisis discussed at the beginning of this section. Unfortunately
nearly a billion people around the world are exposed to waterborne pathogen pollution daily and around 1.5
million children mainly in underdeveloped countries die every year of waterborne diseases from pathogens
(see Figure Deaths by Country from Diarrhea Caused by Unsafe Water, Unimproved Sanitation,
and Poor Hygiene in Children Less than 5 Years Old, 2004 (Figure 5.30)). Pathogens enter water
primarily from human and animal fecal waste due to inadequate sewage treatment. In many underdeveloped
countries, sewage is discharged into local waters either untreated or after only rudimentary treatment. In
developed countries untreated sewage discharge can occur from overows of combined sewer systems, poorly
managed livestock factory farms, and leaky or broken sewage collection systems (see Figure Overowing
Sanitary Sewer (Figure 5.40)). Water with pathogens can be remediated by adding chlorine or ozone, by
boiling, or by treating the sewage in the rst place.

Oil spills are another kind of organic pollution. Oil spills can result from supertanker accidents such as
the Exxon Valdez in 1989, which spilled 10 million gallons of oil into the rich ecosystem of oshore south
Alaska and killed massive numbers of animals. The largest marine oil spill was the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which began with a natural gas explosion (see Figure Deepwater Horizon Explosion (Figure 5.41))
at an oil well 65 km oshore of Louisiana and owed for 3 months in 2010, releasing an estimated 200 million
gallons of oil. The worst oil spill ever occurred during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when Iraq deliberately
dumped approximately 200 million gallons of oil in oshore Kuwait and set more than 700 oil well res that
released enormous clouds of smoke and acid rain for over nine months. During an oil spill on water, oil oats
to the surface because it is less dense than water, and the lightest hydrocarbons evaporate, decreasing the
size of the spill but polluting the air. Then, bacteria begin to decompose the remaining oil, in a process that
can take many years. After several months only about 15% of the original volume may remain, but it is
in thick asphalt lumps, a form that is particularly harmful to birds, sh, and shellsh. Cleanup operations
can include skimmer ships that vacuum oil from the water surface (eective only for small spills), controlled
burning (works only in early stages before the light, ignitable part evaporates but also pollutes the air),
dispersants (detergents that break up oil to accelerate its decomposition, but some dispersants may be toxic
to the ecosystem), and bioremediation (adding microorganisms that specialize in quickly decomposing oil,
but this can disrupt the natural ecosystem).

Toxic chemicals involve many dierent kinds and sources, primarily from industry and mining. General kinds of toxic chemicals include hazardous chemicals, which are a wide variety of synthetic organic and
inorganic chemicals such as acids, bases, cyanide, and a class of compounds called persistent organic pollutants that includes DDT (pesticide), dioxin (herbicide by-product), and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls,
which were used as a liquid insulator in electric transformers). Persistent organic pollutants are long-lived in
the environment, accumulate through the food chain (bioaccumulation), and can be toxic. Another category
of toxic chemicals includes radioactive materials such as cesium, iodine, uranium, and radon gas, which
can result in long-term exposure to radioactivity if it gets into the body. A nal group of toxic chemicals
is heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium, which can accumulate through
the food chain. Heavy metals are commonly produced by industry and at metallic ore mines. Arsenic and
mercury are discussed in more detail below. The US EPA regulates 83 contaminants in drinking water to
ensure a safe public water supply. Similarly, at the international level the World Health Organization has
drinking water standards for a variety of contaminants.
Arsenic (As) has been famous as an agent of death for many centuries. In large doses arsenic causes
cancer and can be fatal. Only recently have scientists recognized that health problems can be caused by
drinking small arsenic concentrations in water over a long time. It attacks the central nervous system
48http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Deepwater_Horizon_oshore_drilling_unit_on_re_2010.jpg

201
and can damage the respiratory system, bladder, lungs, liver, and kidneys. It enters the water supply
naturally from weathering of As-rich minerals and from human activities such as coal burning and smelting
of metallic ores. The worst case of arsenic poisoning occurred in the densely populated impoverished country
of Bangladesh, which had experienced 100,000s of deaths from diarrhea and cholera each year from drinking
surface water contaminated with pathogens due to improper sewage treatment. In the 1970s the United
Nations provided aid for millions of shallow water wells, which resulted in a dramatic drop in pathogenic
diseases. Unfortunately, many of the wells produced water naturally rich in arsenic. Tragically, there are
an estimated 77 million people (about half of the population) who inadvertently may have been exposed to
toxic levels of arsenic in Bangladesh as a result. The World Health Organization has called it the largest
mass poisoning of a population in history.
Mercury (Hg) is used in a variety of electrical products, such as dry cell batteries, uorescent light
bulbs, and switches, as well as in the manufacture of paint, paper, vinyl chloride, and fungicides. In the
methylmercury form (CH3Hg+) it is highly toxic; ≥ 1 ppb of methylmercury represents water contaminated
with mercury. Mercury concentrates in the food chain, especially in sh, in a process caused biomagnication
(see Sidebar Biomagnication (Biomagnication, p. 201)). It acts on the central nervous system and
can cause loss of sight, feeling, and hearing as well as nervousness, shakiness, and death. Like arsenic,
mercury enters the water supply naturally from weathering of Hg-rich minerals and from human activities
such as coal burning and metal processing. A famous mercury poisoning case in Minamata, Japan involved
methylmercury-rich industrial discharge that caused high Hg levels in sh. People in the local shing villages
ate sh up to three times per day for over 30 years, which resulted in over 2,000 deaths. During that time
the responsible company and national government did little to mitigate, help alleviate, or even acknowledge
the problem.
Sidebar: Biomagnication represents the processes in an ecosystem that cause greater concentrations of a chemical, such as methylmercury, in organisms higher up the food chain. Mercury
and methylmercury are present in only very small concentrations in seawater; however, at the base
of the food chain algae absorb methylmercury. Then, small sh eat the algae, large sh and other
organisms higher in the food chain eat the small sh, and so on. Fish and other aquatic organisms
absorb methylmercury rapidly but eliminate it slowly from the body. Therefore, each step up the
food chain increases the concentration from the step below (see Figure Biomagnication (Figure 5.42)). Largemouth bass can concentrate methylmercury up to 10 million times over the water
concentration and sh-eating birds can concentrate it even higher. Other chemicals that exhibit
biomagnication are DDT, PCBs, and arsenic.

Other water pollutants include sediment and heat. Muddy water is bad for drinking but even worse for
underwater plants that need sunlight for photosynthesis. Much of the sediment in water bodies is derived
from the erosion of soil, so it also represents a loss of agricultural productivity. Thermal pollution involves
the release of heated waters from power plants and industry to surface water, causing a drop in the dissolved
O2 content, which can stress sh.
Hard water contains abundant calcium and magnesium, which reduces its ability to develop soapsuds
and enhances scale (calcium and magnesium carbonate minerals) formation on hot water equipment. Water
softeners remove calcium and magnesium, which allows the water to lather easily and resist scale formation.
Hard water develops naturally from the dissolution of calcium and magnesium carbonate minerals in soil; it
does not have negative health eects in people.
Groundwater pollution can occur from underground sources and all of the pollution sources that contaminate surface waters. Common sources of groundwater pollution are leaking underground storage tanks
for fuel, septic tanks, agricultural activity, and landlls. Common groundwater pollutants include nitrate,
pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and petroleum products. Polluted groundwater can be a more serious
problem than polluted surface water because the pollution in groundwater may go undetected for a long time
because usually it moves very slowly. As a result, the pollution in groundwater may create a contaminant
plume, a large body of owing polluted groundwater (see Figure Contaminant Plume in Groundwater (p. 203)), making cleanup very costly. By the time groundwater contamination is detected, the entity

responsible for the pollution may be bankrupt or nonexistent. Another troublesome feature of groundwater
pollution is that small amounts of certain pollutants, e.g., petroleum products and organic solvents, can contaminate large areas. In Denver, Colorado 80 liters of several organic solvents contaminated 4.5 trillion liters
of groundwater and produced a 5 km long contaminant plume. Most groundwater contamination occurs in
shallow, unconned aquifers located near the contamination source. Conned aquifers are less susceptible
to pollution from the surface because of protection by the conning layer. A major threat to groundwater
quality is from underground fuel storage tanks. Fuel tanks commonly are stored underground at gas
stations to reduce explosion hazards. Before 1988 in the U.S. these storage tanks could be made of metal,
which can corrode, leak, and quickly contaminate local groundwater. Now, leak detectors are required and
the metal storage tanks are supposed to be protected from corrosion or replaced with berglass tanks. Currently there are around 600,000 underground fuel storage tanks in the U.S. and over 30% still do not comply
with EPA regulations regarding either release prevention or leak detection.

5.4.6 Sustainable Solutions to the Water Pollution Crisis?
Resolution of the global water pollution crisis described at the beginning of this section requires multiple
approaches to improve the quality of our fresh water and move towards sustainability. The most deadly
form of water pollution, pathogenic microorganisms that cause waterborne diseases, kills almost 2 million
people in underdeveloped countries every year. The best strategy for addressing this problem is proper
sewage (wastewater) treatment. Untreated sewage is not only a major cause of pathogenic diseases, but also
a major source of other pollutants, including oxygen-demanding waste, plant nutrients (N and P), and toxic

MINERALS
heavy metals. Wastewater treatment is done at a sewage treatment plant in urban areas and through a
septic tank system in rural areas.
The main purpose of a sewage treatment plant is to remove organic matter (oxygen-demanding waste) and
kill bacteria; special methods also can be used to remove plant nutrients and other pollutants. The numerous processing steps at a conventional sewage treatment plant (see Figure Steps at a Sewage Treatment
Plant (Figure 5.44)) include pretreatment (screening and removal of sand and gravel), primary treatment
(settling or oatation to remove organic solids, fat, and grease), secondary treatment (aerobic bacterial
decomposition of organic solids), tertiary treatment (bacterial decomposition of nutrients and ltration),
disinfection (treatment with chlorine, ozone, ultraviolet light, or bleach), and either discharge to surface
waters (usually a local river) or reuse for some other purpose, such as irrigation, habitat preservation, and
articial groundwater recharge. The concentrated organic solid produced during primary and secondarytreatment is called sludge, which is treated in a variety of ways including landll disposal, incineration,
use as fertilizer, and anaerobic bacterial decomposition, which is done in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic
decomposition of sludge produces methane gas, which can be used as an energy source. To reduce water
pollution problems, separate sewer systems (where street runo goes to rivers and only wastewater goes
to a wastewater treatment plant) are much better than combined sewer systems, which can overow and
release untreated sewage into surface waters during heavy rain. Some cities such as Chicago, Illinois have
constructed large underground caverns and also use abandoned rock quarries to hold storm sewer overow.
After the rain stops, the stored water goes to the sewage treatment plant for processing.

A septic tank system is an individual sewage treatment system for homes in rural and even some urban
settings. The basic components of a septic tank system (see Figure Septic System (Figure 5.45)) include a
sewer line from the house, a septic tank (a large container where sludge settles to the bottom and microorganisms decompose the organic solids anaerobically), and the drain eld (network of perforated pipes where
the claried water seeps into the soil and is further puried by bacteria). Water pollution problems occur if
the septic tank malfunctions, which usually occurs when a system is established in the wrong type of soil or
maintained poorly.

however, the World Health Organization estimates an estimated cost savings of between $3 and $34 for every
$1 invested in clean water delivery and sanitation (Water for Life, 2005 (p. 209)). The cost savings are from
health care savings, gains in work and school productivity, and deaths prevented. Simple and inexpensive
techniques for treating water at home include chlorination, lters, and solar disinfection. Another alternative
is to use constructed wetlands technology (marshes built to treat contaminated water), which is simpler
and cheaper than a conventional sewage treatment plant.
Bottled water is not a sustainable solution to the water crisis, despite exponential growth in popularity
in the U.S. and the world. Bottled water is not necessarily any safer than the U.S. public water supply, it
costs on average about 700 times more than U.S. tap water, and every year it uses approximately 200 billion
plastic and glass bottles that have a relatively low rate of recycling. Compared to tap water, it uses much
more energy, mainly in bottle manufacturing and long-distance transportation. If you don't like the taste of
your tap water, then please use a water lter instead of bottled water!

Additional sustainable solutions to the water pollution crisis include legislation to eliminate or greatly
reduce point sources of water pollution. In the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972 and later amendments
led to major improvements in water quality (see Sidebar Clean Water Act (Clean Water Act, p. 208)).
Nonpoint sources of water pollution, e.g., agricultural runo and urban runo (see Figure Storm Drain (p.
207)), are much harder to regulate because of their widespread, diuse nature. There are many construction
and agricultural practices that reduce polluted runo including no-till farming and sediment traps. Articial
aeration or mechanical mixing can remediate lakes with oxygen depletion. Specic things that we can do

to reduce urban runo include the following: keep soil, leaves, and grass clippings o driveways, sidewalks,
and streets; don't pour used motor oil, antifreeze, paints, pesticides, or any household hazardous chemical
down the storm sewer or drain; recycle used motor oil; use hazardous waste disposal programs oered by
the community; compost your organic waste; don't use fertilizers and herbicides on your lawn; and ush pet
waste down the toilet.
Sidebar: During the early 1900s rapid industrialization in the U.S. resulted in widespread water
pollution due to free discharge of waste into surface waters. The Cuyahoga River in northeast
Ohio caught re numerous times (see Figure Cuyahoga River on Fire (Figure 5.47)), including
a famous re in 1969 that caught the nation's attention. In 1972 Congress passed one of the most
important environmental laws in U.S. history, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which
is more commonly called the Clean Water Act. The purpose of the Clean Water Act and later
amendments is to maintain and restore water quality, or in simpler terms to make our water
swimmable and shable. It became illegal to dump pollution into surface water unless there was
formal permission and U.S. water quality improved signicantly as a result. More progress is needed
because currently the EPA considers over 40,000 U.S. water bodies as impaired, most commonly
due to pathogens, metals, plant nutrients, and oxygen depletion. Another concern is protecting
groundwater quality, which is not yet addressed suciently by federal law.

Sometimes slow ow through a soil can naturally purify groundwater because some pollutants, such as P,
pesticides, and heavy metals, chemically bind with surfaces of soil clays and iron oxides. Other pollutants
are not retained by soil particles: These include N, road salt, gasoline fuel, the herbicide atrazine, tetrachloroethylene (a carcinogenic cleaning solvent used in dry cleaning), and vinyl chloride. In other cases,
slow groundwater ow can allow bacteria to decompose dead organic matter and certain pesticides. There
are many other ways to remediate polluted groundwater. Sometimes the best solution is to stop the pollution source and allow natural cleanup. Specic treatment methods depend on the geology, hydrology,
and pollutant because some light contaminants ow on top of groundwater, others dissolve and ow with
groundwater, and dense contaminants can sink below groundwater. A common cleanup method called pump
and treat involves pumping out the contaminated groundwater and treating it by oxidation, ltration, or
biological methods. Sometimes soil must be excavated and sent to a landll. In-situ treatment methods
include adding chemicals to immobilize heavy metals, creating a permeable reaction zone with metallic iron
that can destroy organic solvents, or using bioremediation by adding oxygen or nutrients to stimulate
growth of microorganisms.

5.5 Case Study: The Love Canal Disaster57
One of the most famous and important examples of groundwater pollution in the U.S. is the Love Canal
tragedy in Niagara Falls, New York. It is important because the pollution disaster at Love Canal, along with
similar pollution calamities at that time (Times Beach, Missouri and Valley of Drums, Kentucky), helped to
create Superfund, a federal program instituted in 1980 and designed to identify and clean up the worst of
the hazardous chemical waste sites in the U.S.
Love Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls named after a large ditch (approximately 15 m wide, 312
m deep, and 1600 m long) that was dug in the 1890s for hydroelectric power. The ditch was abandoned
before it actually generated any power and went mostly unused for decades, except for swimming by local
residents. In the 1920s Niagara Falls began dumping urban waste into Love Canal, and in the 1940s the

U.S. Army dumped waste from World War II there, including waste from the frantic eort to build a nuclear
bomb. Hooker Chemical purchased the land in 1942 and lined it with clay. Then, the company put into Love
Canal an estimated 21,000 tons of hazardous chemical waste, including the carcinogens benzene, dioxin, and
PCBs in large metal barrels and covered them with more clay. In 1953, Hooker sold the land to the Niagara
Falls school board for $1, and included a clause in the sales contract that both described the land use (lled
with chemical waste) and absolved them from any future damage claims from the buried waste. The school
board promptly built a public school on the site and sold the surrounding land for a housing project that
built 200 or so homes along the canal banks and another 1,000 in the neighborhood (see Figure Love Canal
(Figure 5.48)). During construction, the canal's clay cap and walls were breached, damaging some of the
metal barrels.

Eventually, the chemical waste seeped into people's basements, and the metal barrels worked their way to
the surface. Trees and gardens began to die; bicycle tires and the rubber soles of children's shoes disintegrated
in noxious puddles. From the 1950s to the late 1970s, residents repeatedly complained of strange odors and
substances that surfaced in their yards. City ocials investigated the area, but did not act to solve the
problem. Local residents allegedly experienced major health problems including high rates of miscarriages,
birth defects, and chromosome damage, but studies by the New York State Health Department disputed that.
Finally, in 1978 President Carter declared a state of emergency at Love Canal, making it the rst human58http://www.epa.gov/region2/superfund/npl/lovecanal/images.html

MINERALS
caused environmental problem to be designated that way. The Love Canal incident became a symbol of
improperly stored chemical waste. Clean up of Love Canal, which was funded by Superfund and completely
nished in 2004, involved removing contaminated soil, installing drainage pipes to capture contaminated
groundwater for treatment, and covering it with clay and plastic. In 1995, Occidental Chemical (the modern
name for Hooker Chemical) paid $102 million to Superfund for cleanup and $27 million to Federal Emergency
Management Association for the relocation of more than 1,000 families. New York State paid $98 million to
EPA and the US government paid $8 million for pollution by the Army. The total clean up cost was estimated
to be $275 million. The only good thing about the Love Canal tragedy is that it helped to create Superfund,
which has analyzed tens of thousands of hazardous waste sites in the U.S. and cleaned up hundreds of the
worst ones. Nevertheless, over 1,000 major hazardous waste sites with a signicant risk to human health or
the environment are still in the process of being cleaned.
5.6 Mineral Resources: Formation, Mining, Environmental Impact59
5.6.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• know the importance of minerals to society
• know factors that control availability of mineral resources
• know why future world mineral supply and demand is an important issue
• understand the environmental impact of mining and processing of minerals
• understand how we can work toward solving the crisis involving mineral supply
5.6.2 Importance of Minerals
Mineral resources are essential to our modern industrial society and they are used everywhere. For
example, at breakfast you drink some juice in a glass (made from melted quartz sand), eat from a ceramic
plate (created from clay minerals heated at high temperatures), sprinkle salt (halite) on your eggs, use steel
utensils (from iron ore and other minerals), read a magazine (coated with up to 50% kaolinite clay to give the
glossy look), and answer your cellphone (containing over 40 dierent minerals including copper, silver, gold,
and platinum). We need minerals to make cars, computers, appliances, concrete roads, houses, tractors,
fertilizer, electrical transmission lines, and jewelry. Without mineral resources, industry would collapse and
living standards would plummet. In 2010, the average person in the U.S. consumed more than16,000 pounds
of mineral resources60 (see Table Per Capita Consumption of Minerals (Table 5.1)). With an average
life expectancy of 78 years, that translates to about1.3 million pounds of mineral resources over such a
person's lifetime. Here are a few statistics that help to explain these large values of mineral use: an average
American house contains about 250,000 pounds of minerals (see Figure Mineral Use in the Kitchen
(Figure 5.49) for examples of mineral use in the kitchen), one mile of Interstate highway uses 170 million
pounds of earth materials, and the U.S. has nearly 4 million miles of roads. All of these mineral resources are
nonrenewable, because nature usually takes hundreds of thousands to millions of years to produce mineral
deposits. Early hominids used rocks as simple tools as early as 2.6 million years ago. At least 500,000 years
ago prehistoric people used int (ne-grained quartz) for knives and arrowheads. Other important early
uses of minerals include mineral pigments such as manganese oxides and iron oxides for art, salt for food
preservation, stone for pyramids, and metals such as bronze (typically tin and copper), which is stronger
than pure copper and iron for steel, which is stronger than bronze.

5.6.3 Mineral Resource Principles
A geologist denes a mineral as a naturally occurring inorganic solid with a dened chemical composition
and crystal structure (regular arrangement of atoms). Minerals are the ingredients of rock, which is a
solid coherent (i.e., will not fall apart) piece of planet Earth. There are three classes of rock, igneous,
sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks form by cooling and solidication of hot molten rock called
lava or magma. Lava solidies at the surface after it is ejected by a volcano, and magma cools underground.
Sedimentary rocks form by hardening of layers of sediment (loose grains such as sand or mud) deposited
at Earth's surface or by mineral precipitation, i.e., formation of minerals in water from dissolved mineral
matter. Metamorphic rocks form when the shape or type of minerals in a preexisting rock changes due
to intense heat and pressure deep within the Earth. Ore is rock with an enrichment of minerals that
can be mined for prot. Sometimes ore deposits (locations with abundant ore) can be beautiful, such
as the giant gypsum crystals at the amazing Cave of the Crystals in Mexico (see Figure Giant Gypsum
Crystals (Figure 5.50)). The enrichment factor, which is the ratio of the metal concentration needed
for an economic ore deposit over the average abundance of that metal in Earth's crust, is listed for several
important metals in the Table Enrichment Factor (Table 5.2: Enrichment Factor). Mining of some metals,
such as aluminum and iron, is protable at relatively small concentration factors, whereas for others, such
as lead and mercury, it is protable only at very large concentration factors. The metal concentration in ore
(column 3 in Table Enrichment Factor (Table 5.2: Enrichment Factor)) can also be expressed in terms of
the proportion of metal and waste rock produced after processing one metric ton (1,000 kg) of ore. Iron is
at one extreme, with up to 690 kg of Fe metal and only 310 kg of waste rock produced from pure iron ore,
and gold is at the other extreme with only one gram (.03 troy oz) of Au metal and 999.999 kg of waste rock
produced from gold ore.

5.6.4 Formation of Ore Deposits
Ore deposits form when minerals are concentratedsometimes by a factor of many thousandsin rock,
usually by one of six major processes. These include the following: (a) igneous crystallization, where
molten rock cools to form igneous rock. This process forms building stone such as granite, a variety of
gemstones, sulfur ore, and metallic ores, which involve dense chromium or platinum minerals that sink to
the bottom of liquid magma. Diamonds form in rare Mg-rich igneous rock called kimberlite that originates
as molten rock at 150200 km depth (where the diamonds form) and later moves very quickly to the surface,
where it erupts explosively. The cooled magma forms a narrow, carrot-shaped feature called a pipe. Diamond
mines in kimberlite pipes can be relatively narrow but deep (see Figure A Diamond Mine (Figure 5.51)).
(b) Hydrothermal is the most common ore-forming process. It involves hot, salty water that dissolves
metallic elements from a large area and then precipitates ore minerals in a smaller area, commonly along
rock fractures and faults. Molten rock commonly provides the heat and the water is from groundwater, the
ocean, or the magma itself. The ore minerals usually contain sulde (S2-) bonded to metals such as copper,
lead, zinc, mercury, and silver. Actively forming hydrothermal ore deposits occur at undersea mountain
ranges, called oceanic ridges, where new ocean crust is produced. Here, mineral-rich waters up to 350 ◦C
sometimes discharge from cracks in the crust and precipitate a variety of metallic sulde minerals that
make the water appear black; they are called black smokers (see Figure Black Smokers (Figure 5.52)).
(c) Metamorphism occurs deep in the earth under very high temperature and pressure and produces
several building stones, including marble and slate, as well as some nonmetallic ore, including asbestos,
talc, and graphite. (d) Sedimentary processes occur in rivers that concentrate sand and gravel (used in
construction), as well as dense gold particles and diamonds that weathered away from bedrock. These gold
and diamond ore bodies are called placer deposits. Other sedimentary ore deposits include the deep ocean
oor, which contains manganese and cobalt ore deposits and evaporated lakes or seawater, which produce
halite and a variety of other salts. (e) Biological processes involve the action of living organisms and
are responsible for the formation of pearls in oysters, as well as phosphorous ore in the feces of birds and
the bones and teeth of sh. (f) Weathering in tropical rain forest environments involves soil water that
concentrates insoluble elements such as aluminum (bauxite) by dissolving away the soluble elements.
69Economic concentration value for gold comes from Craig, Vaughan, Skinner (2011).

220 CHAPTER 5. PHYSICAL RESOURCES: WATER, POLLUTION, AND
MINERALS
5.6.5 Mining and Processing Ore
There are two kinds of mineral mines, surface mines and underground mines. The kind of mine used
depends on the quality of the ore, i.e., concentration of mineral and its distance from the surface. Surface
mines include open-pit mines, which commonly involve large holes that extract relatively low-grade metallic
ore (see Figure Open Pit Mine (Figure 5.53)), strip mines, which extract horizontal layers of ore or rock,
and placer mines, where gold or diamonds are extracted from river and beach sediment by scooping up
(dredging) the sediment and then separating the ore by density. Large, open-pit mines can create huge piles
of rock (called overburden) that was removed to expose the ore as well as huge piles of ore for processing.
Underground mines, which are used when relatively high-grade ore is too deep for surface mining, involve a
network of tunnels to access and extract the ore. Processing metallic ore (e.g., gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc,
nickel, and lead) can involve numerous steps including crushing, grinding with water, physically separating
the ore minerals from non-ore minerals often by density, and chemically separating the metal from the ore
minerals using methods such as smelting (heating the ore minerals with dierent chemicals to extract the
metal) and leaching (using chemicals to dissolve the metal from a large volume of crushed rock). The
ne-grained waste produced from processing ore is called tailings. Slag is the glassy unwanted by-product
of smelting ore. Many of the nonmetallic minerals and rocks do not require chemical separation techniques.

5.6.6 Mineral Resources and Sustainability Issues
Our heavy dependence on mineral resources presents humanity with some dicult challenges related to
sustainability, including how to cope with nite supplies and how to mitigate the enormous environmental
impacts of mining and processing ore. As global population growth continuesand perhaps more importantly, as standards of living rise around the worlddemand for products made from minerals will increase.
In particular, the economies of China, India, Brazil, and a few other countries are growing very quickly, and
their demand for critical mineral resources also is accelerating. That means we are depleting our known
mineral deposits at an increasing rate, requiring that new deposits be found and put into production. Figure
Demand for Nonfuel Minerals Materials (Figure 5.54) shows the large increase in US mineral consumption between 1900 and 2006. Considering that mineral resources are nonrenewable, it is reasonable to
ask how long they will last. The Table Strategic Minerals (Table 5.3: Strategic Minerals) gives a greatly
approximated answer to that question for a variety of important and strategic minerals based on the
current production and the estimated mineral reserves. Based on this simplied analysis, the estimated
life of these important mineral reserves varies from more than 800 to 20 years. It is important to realize that

MINERALS
we will not completely run out of any of these minerals but rather the economically viable mineral deposits
will be used up. Additional complications arise if only a few countries produce the mineral and they decide
not to export it. This situation is looming for rare earth elements, which currently are produced mainly by
China, which is threatening to limit exports of these strategic minerals.

Commodity Summaries, 2011
A more complex analysis of future depletions of our mineral supplies predicts that 20 out of 23 minerals
studied will likely experience a permanent shortfall in global supply by 2030 where global production is
less than global demand (Clugston, 2010 (p. 226)). Specically this study concludes the following: for
cadmium, gold, mercury, tellurium, and tungstenthey have already passed their global production peak,
their future production only will decline, and it is nearly certain that there will be a permanent global supply
shortfall by 2030; for cobalt, lead, molybdenum, platinum group metals, phosphate rock, silver, titanium,
and zincthey are likely at or near their global production peak and there is a very high probability that
there will be a permanent global supply shortfall by 2030; for chromium, copper, indium, iron ore, lithium,
magnesium compounds, nickel, and phosphate rockthey are expected to reach their global production
peak between 2010 and 2030 and there is a high probability that there will be a permanent global supply
shortfall by 2030; and for bauxite, rare earth minerals, and tinthey are not expected to reach their global
production peak before 2030 and there is a low probability that there will be a permanent global supply
shortfall by 2030. It is important to note that these kinds of predictions of future mineral shortages are
dicult and controversial. Other scientists disagree with Clugston's predictions of mineral shortages in the
near future. Predictions similar to Clugston were made in the 1970s and they were wrong. It is dicult to
know exactly the future demand for minerals and the size of future mineral reserves. The remaining life for
specic minerals will decrease if future demand increases. On the other hand, mineral reserves can increase
if new mineral deposits are found (increasing the known amount of ore) or if currently unprotable mineral
deposits become protable ones due to either a mineral price increase or technological improvements that
make mining or processing cheaper. Mineral resources, a much larger category than mineral reserves, are
the total amount of a mineral that is not necessarily protable to mine today but that has some sort of
economic potential.
Mining and processing ore can have considerable impact on the environment. Surface mines can create
enormous pits (see Figure Open Pit Mine (Figure 5.53)) in the ground as well as large piles of overburden
and tailings that need to be reclaimed, i.e., restored to a useful landscape. Since 1977 surface mines
in U.S. are required to be reclaimed, and commonly reclamation is relatively well done in this country.
Unfortunately, surface mine reclamation is not done everywhere, especially in underdeveloped countries, due
to lack of regulations or lax enforcement of regulations. Unreclaimed surface mines and active surface mines
can be major sources of water and sediment pollution. Metallic ore minerals (e.g., copper, lead, zinc, mercury,
and silver) commonly include abundant sulde, and many metallic ore deposits contain abundant pyrite (iron
sulde). The sulde in these minerals oxidizes quickly when exposed to air at the surface producing sulfuric
acid, called acid mine drainage. As a result streams, ponds, and soil water contaminated with this
drainage can be highly acidic, reaching pH values of zero or less (see Figure Acid Mine Drainage)! The acidic
water can leach heavy metals such as nickel, copper, lead, arsenic, aluminum, and manganese from mine
tailings and slag. The acidic contaminated water can be highly toxic to the ecosystem. Plants usually will
not regrow in such acidic soil water, and therefore soil erosion rates skyrocket due to the persistence of bare,
unvegetated surfaces. With a smaller amount of tailings and no overburden, underground mines usually are
much easier to reclaim, and they produce much less acid mine drainage. The major environmental problem
with underground mining is the hazardous working environment for miners primarily caused by cave-ins and
lung disease due to prolonged inhalation of dust particles. Underground cave-ins also can damage the surface
from subsidence. Smelting can be a major source of air pollution, especially SO2 gas. The case history below
examines the environmental impact of mining and processing gold ore.

5.6.7 Sustainable Solutions to the Mineral Crisis?
Providing sustainable solutions to the problem of a dwindling supply of a nonrenewable resource such as
minerals seems contradictory. Nevertheless, it is extremely important to consider strategies that move
towards sustainability even if true sustainability is not possible for most minerals. The general approach
towards mineral sustainability should include mineral conservation at the top of the list. We also need
to maximize exploration for new mineral resources while at the same time we minimize the environmental
impact of mineral mining and processing.
Conservation of mineral resources includes improved eciency, substitution, and the 3 Rs of sustainability,
reduce, reuse, and recycle. Improved eciency applies to all features of mineral use including mining,
processing, and creation of mineral products. Substituting a rare nonrenewable resource with either a more
abundant nonrenewable resource or a renewable resource can help. Examples include substituting glass
ber optic cables for copper in telephone wires and wood for aluminum in construction. Reducing global
demand for mineral resources will be a challenge, considering projections of continuing population growth

226 CHAPTER 5. PHYSICAL RESOURCES: WATER, POLLUTION, AND
MINERALS
and the rapid economic growth of very large countries such as China, India, and Brazil. Historically economic
growth is intimately tied to increased mineral consumption, and therefore it will be dicult for those rapidly
developing countries to decrease their future demand for minerals. In theory, it should be easier for countries
with a high mineral consumption rate such as the U.S. to reduce their demand for minerals but it will take a
signicant change in mindset to accomplish that. Technology can help some with some avenues to reducing
mineral consumption. For example, digital cameras have virtually eliminated the photographic demand for
silver, which is used for lm development. Using stronger and more durable alloys of steel can translate to
fewer construction materials needed. Examples of natural resource reuse include everything at an antique
store and yard sale. Recycling can extend the lifetime of mineral reserves, especially metals. Recycling is
easiest for pure metals such as copper pipes and aluminum cans, but much harder for alloys (mixtures of
metals) and complex manufactured goods, such as computers. Many nonmetals cannot be recycled; examples
include road salt and fertilizer. Recycling is easier for a wealthy country because there are more nancial
resources to use for recycling and more goods to recycle. Additional signicant benets of mineral resource
conservation are less pollution and environmental degradation from new mineral mining and processing as
well as reductions in energy use and waste production.
Because demand for new minerals will likely increase in the future, we must continue to search for new
minerals, even though we probably have already found many of the easy targets, i.e., high-grade ore deposits close to the surface and in convenient locations. To nd more dicult ore targets, we will need to
apply many technologies including geophysical methods (seismic, gravity, magnetic, and electrical measurements, as well as remote sensing, which uses satellite-based measurements of electromagnetic radiation from
Earth's surface), geochemical methods (looking for chemical enrichments in soil, water, air, and plants), and
geological information including knowledge of plate tectonics theory. We also may need to consider exploring
and mining unconventional areas such as continental margins (submerged edges of continents), the ocean
oor (where there are large deposits of manganese ore and other metals in rocks called manganese nodules),
and oceanic ridges (undersea mountains that have copper, zinc, and lead ore bodies).
Finally, we need to explore for, mine, and process new minerals while minimizing pollution and other
environmental impacts. Regulations and good engineering practices are necessary to ensure adequate mine
reclamation and pollution reduction, including acid mine drainage. The emerging eld of biotechnology may
provide some sustainable solutions to metal extraction. Specic methods include biooxidation (microbial
enrichment of metals in a solid phase), bioleaching (microbial dissolution of metals), biosorption (attachment of metals to cells), and genetic engineering of microbes (creating microorganisms specialized in
extracting metal from ore).

5.7 Case Study: Gold: Worth its Weight?76
Gold is a symbol of wealth, prestige, and royalty that has attracted and fascinated people for many thousands
of years (see Figure Native Gold (Figure 5.56)). Gold is considered by many to be the most desirable
precious metal because it has been sought after for coins, jewelry, and other arts since long before the
beginning of recorded history. Historically its value was used as a currency standard (the gold standard)
although not anymore. Gold is very dense but also very malleable; a gram of gold can be hammered into
a 1 m2
sheet of gold leaf. Gold is extremely resistant to corrosion and chemical attack, making it almost
indestructible. It is also very rare and costly to produce. Today the primary uses of gold are jewelry and the
arts, electronics, and dentistry. The major use in electronics is gold plating of electrical contacts to provide
a corrosion-resistant conductive layer on copper. Most gold is easily recycled except for gold plating due to
combinations with other compounds such as cyanide. About half of the world's gold ever produced has been
produced since 1965 (see Figure World Gold Production (Figure 5.57)). At the current consumption rate
today's gold reserves are expected to last only 20 more years.

There are two types of gold ore deposits: (1) hydrothermal, where magma-heated groundwater dissolves
gold from a large volume of rock and deposits it in rock fractures and (2) placer, where rivers erode a
gold ore deposit of hydrothermal origin and deposit the heavy gold grains at the bottom of river channels.
Although gold's resistance to chemical attack makes it extremely durable and reusable, that same property
also makes gold dicult to extract from rock. As a result, some gold mining methods can have an enormous
environmental impact. The rst discovered gold ore was from placer deposits, which are relatively simple to
mine. The method of extracting gold in a placer deposit involves density settling of gold grains in moving
water, similar to how placer deposits form. Specic variations of placer mining include hushing (developed
by the ancient Romans where a torrent of water is sent through a landscape via an aqueduct), sluice box
(where running water passes through a wooden box with ries on the bottom), panning (a hand-held conical
metal pan where water swirls around) and hydraulic (where high pressure hoses cut into natural landscapes,
see Figure Hydraulic Mining (Figure 5.58)). Hydraulic mining, developed during the California Gold
Rush in the middle 1800s, can destroy natural settings, accelerate soil erosion, and create sediment-rich rivers
that later ood due to sediment inlling the channel. The largest gold ore body ever discovered is an ancient,
lithied (i.e., hardened) placer deposit. Nearly half of the world's gold ever mined has come from South
Africa's Witwatersrand deposits, which also have the world's deepest underground mine at about 4,000 m.
To increase the eciency of gold panning, liquid mercury is added to gold pans because mercury can form an
alloy with gold in a method called mercury amalgamation. The mercury-gold amalgam is then collected

and heated to vaporize the mercury and concentrate the gold. Although mercury amalgamation is no longer
used commercially, it is still used by amateur gold panners. Unfortunately, considerable mercury has been
released to the environment with this method, which is problematic because mercury bioaccumulates and it
is easily converted to methylmercury, which is highly toxic.

Today most gold mining is done by a method called heap leaching, where cyanide-rich water percolates
through nely ground gold ore and dissolves the gold over a period of months; eventually the water is
collected and treated to remove the gold. This process revolutionized gold mining because it allowed economic
recovery of gold from very low-grade ore (down to 1 ppm) and even from gold ore tailings that previously
were considered waste. On the other hand, heap leaching is controversial because of the toxic nature of
cyanide. The world's largest cyanide spill to date occurred at Baia Mare in northern Romania (see Figure
Baia Mare (Figure 5.59)). In January 2000 after a period of heavy rain and snowmelt, a dam surrounding
a gold tailings pond collapsed and sent into the drainage basin of the Danube River 100,000 m3
(100 million
liters) of water with 500 - 1,000 ppm cyanide80, killing more than a thousand metric tons of sh (see Figure
Baia Mare Cyanide Spill (Figure 5.60)). Considering the large environmental impact of gold mining, this
may take some of the glitter from gold.

6.1.1 Introduction
The eld of environmental and natural resource economics sounds to many like an oxymoron. Most people
think economists study money, nance, and businessso what does that have to do with the environment?
Economics is really broadly dened as the study of the allocation of scarce resources. In other words, economics is a social science that helps people understand how to make hard choices when there are unavoidable
tradeos. For example, a company can make and sell more cars, which brings in revenue, but doing so also
increases production costs. Or a student can choose to have a part-time job to reduce the size of the loan
she needs to pay for college, but that reduces the time she has for studying and makes it harder for her to
get good grades. Some economists do study business, helping companies and industries design production,
marketing, and investment strategies that maximize their prots. Other economists work to understand and
inform the choices individuals make about their investments in education and how to divide their time between work, leisure, and family in order to make themselves and their families better o. Environmental and

234 CHAPTER 6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
natural resource economists study the tradeos associated with one of the most important scarce resources
we havenature.
Economists contribute to the study of environmental problems with two kinds of work. First, they
do normative studies of how people should manage resources and invest in environmental quality to make
themselves and/or society as well o as possible. Second, they do positive analyses of how human agents
individuals, rms, and so forthactually do behave. Normative studies give recommendations and guidance
for people and policy makers to follow. Positive studies of human behavior help us to understand what
causes environmental problems and which policies are most likely to work well to alleviate them.
This chapter gives an overview of a few of the key ideas that have been developed in this eld. First,
we will learn the economic theories that help us understand where environmental problems come from and
what makes something a problem that actually needs to be xed. This section of the chapter will introduce
the concepts of externalities, public goods, and open access resources, and explain how in situations with
those features we often end up with too much pollution and excessive rates of natural resource exploitation.
Second, we will learn the tools economists have developed to quantify the value of environmental amenities.
It is very dicult to identify a monetary value for things like clean air and wildlife, which are not traded in
a marketplace, but such value estimates are often helpful inputs for public discussions about environmental
policies and investments. Third, we will discuss a set of approaches economists use to evaluate environmental
policies and projects. We want to design policies that are good, but what exactly does that mean? Finally,
we will learn about the dierent policy tools that can be used to solve problems of excess environmental
degradation and resource exploitation, including a set of incentive policies that were designed by economists
to work with rather than against the way that people really behave, and we will discuss the strengths and
weaknesses of those dierent tools.
6.2 Tragedy of the Commons3
6.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• know how economists dene environmental outcomes that make society as well o as possible.
• understand what externalities are, and how they can lead to outcomes with too much pollution and
resource exploitation.
• be able to dene public goods and common-property resources, and understand how those things are
prone to under-provision and over-exploitation, respectively.
6.2.2 Introduction
To identify and solve environmental problems, we need to understand what situations are actually problems
(somehow formally dened) and what circumstances and behaviors cause them. We might think that it is
easy to recognize a problempollution is bad, saving natural resources is good. However, critical thinking
often reveals snap judgments to be overly simplistic. Some examples help to illustrate this point.
• Running out! Oil is a depletable resource, and many people worry that rapid extraction and use of
oil might cause us to run out. But would it really be a bad thing to use up all the oil as long as we
developed alternative energy technologies to which we could turn when the oil was gone? Is there any
intrinsic value to keeping a stock of oil unused in the ground? Running out of oil someday may not
be a problem. However, subsidies for oil extraction might cause us to run out more quickly than is
socially optimal. Other ineciencies arise if multiple companies own wells that tap the same pool of
oil, and each ends up racing to extract the oil before the others can take it awaythat kind of race
can increase total pumping costs and reduce the total amount of oil that can be gleaned from the pool.

• Biological pollution! Horror stories abound in the news about the havoc raised by some nonnative
animal and plant species in the United States. Zebra mussels clog boats and industrial pipes, yellow
star thistle is toxic to horses and reduces native biodiversity in the American West, and the emerald
ash borer kills ash trees as it marches across the landscape. From the current tone of much media and
scientic discourse about nonnative species, one could conclude that all nonnative species are problems.
But does that mean we should forbid farmers in the U.S from growing watermelons, which come from
Africa? Or should we ship all the ring-necked pheasants back to Eurasia whence they originally came,
and tell North Dakota to choose a new state bird? The costs and benets of nonnative species vary
greatly  one policy approach is not likely to apply well to them all.
This section rst explains the way economists think about whether an outcome is good. Then it describes
some of the features of natural resources and environmental quality that often trigger problematic human
behaviors related to the environment.
6.2.3 Eciency and Deadweight Loss
Ask anyone who lived during the centrally-planned, nonmarket economy years of the Soviet Unionmarkets
are very good at many things. When a product becomes scarcer or more costly to produce we would like
to send signals to consumers that would cause them to buy less of that thing. If an input is more valuable
when used to produce one good than another, we would like to send signals to rms to make sure that
input is put to its best use. If conditions are right, market prices do these useful things and more. Markets
distribute inputs eciently through the production side of the economy: they ensure that plant managers
don't need to hoard inputs and then drive around bartering with each other for the things they need to make
their products, and they arrange for ecient quantities of goods to be produced. Markets also distribute
outputs among consumers without surpluses, shortages, or large numbers of bathing suits being foisted upon
consumers in Siberia.
Economists mean something very specic when they use the word ecient. In general, an allocation
is ecient if it maximizes social well-being, or welfare. Traditional economics denes welfare as total net
benetsthe dierence between the total benets all people in society get from market goods and services
and the total costs of producing those things. Environmental economists enhance the denition of welfare.
The values of environmental goods like wildlife count on the benet side of net benets and damages to
environmental quality from production and consumptive processes count as costs.
Under ideal circumstances, market outcomes are ecient. In perfect markets for regular goods, goods
are produced at the point where the cost to society of producing the last unit, the marginal cost, is just
equal to the amount a consumer is willing to pay for that last unit, the marginal benet, which means that
the net benets in the market are maximized. Regular goods are supplied by industry such that supply is
equivalent to the marginal production costs to the rms, and they are demanded by consumers in such a way
that we can read the marginal benet to consumers o the demand curve; when the market equilibrates at
a price that causes quantity demanded to equal quantity supplied at that price (Qmarket in Figure Market
Equilibrium (Figure 6.2)), it is also true that marginal benet equals marginal cost.

supplied equals the quantity demanded, and thus private marginal cost equals private marginal benet.

Even depletable resources such as oil would be used eciently by a well-functioning market. It is socially
ecient to use a depletable resource over time such that the price rises at the same rate as the rate of
interest. Increasing scarcity pushes the price up, which stimulates eorts to use less of the resource and to
invest in research to make backstop alternatives more cost-eective. Eventually, the cost of the resource
rises to the point where the backstop technology is competitive, and the market switches from the depletable
resource to the backstop. We see this with copper; high prices of depletable copper trigger substitution to
other materials, like ber optics for telephone cables and plastics for pipes. We would surely see the same
thing happen with fossil fuels; if prices are allowed to rise with scarcity, rms have more incentives to engage
in research that lowers the cost of backstop technologies like solar and wind power, and we will eventually
just switch.
Unfortunately, many conditions can lead to market failure such that the market outcome does not
maximize social welfare. The extent to which net benets fall short of their potential is called deadweight
loss. Deadweight loss can exist when not enough of a good is produced, or too much of a good is produced,
or production is not done in the most cost-eective (least expensive) way possible, where costs include
environmental damages. Some types of market failures (and thus deadweight loss) are extremely common

in environmental settings.
6.2.4 Externalities
In a market economy, people and companies make choices to balance the costs and benets that accrue to
them. That behavior can sometimes yield outcomes that maximize total social welfare even if individual
agents are only seeking to maximize their own personal well-being, because self-interested trades lead the
market to settle where aggregate marginal benets equal aggregate marginal costs and thus total net benets
are maximized.
However, people and companies do not always bear the full costs and benets associated with the actions
they take. When this is true economists say there are externalities, and individual actions do not typically
yield ecient outcomes.
A negative externality is a cost associated with an action that is not borne by the person who chooses
to take that action. For example, if a student cheats on an exam, that student might get a higher grade.
However, if the class is graded on a curve, all the other students will get lower grades. And if the professor
learns that cheating happened, she might take steps to prevent cheating on the next exam that make the
testing environment more unpleasant for all the students (no calculators allowed, no bathroom breaks, id
checks, etc.). Negative externalities are rampant in environmental settings:
• Companies that spill oil into the ocean do not bear the full costs of the resulting harm to the marine
environment, which include everything from degraded commercial sheries to reduced endangered sea
turtle populations).
• Commuters generate emissions of air pollution, which lowers the ambient quality of the air in areas
they pass through and causes health problems for other people.
• Developers who build houses in bucolic exurban settings cause habitat fragmentation and biodiversity
loss, inicting a cost on the public at large.

York, with Lake Eire (top) and Lake Ontario (bottom) featured. Both natural, white clouds and manmade smog (grey clouds below) are visible. The smog is an example of a negative externality, as the cost

In situations where an action or good has a negative externality, the private marginal cost that shapes
the behavior of an agent is lower than the marginal cost to society as a whole, which includes the private
marginal cost and the external environmental marginal cost. The ecient outcome would be where the social
marginal cost equals the social marginal benet (labeled Qecient in Figure Ineciency from Negative
Externality (Figure 6.4)). Unfortunately, the free-market outcome (labeled Qmarket in Figure Ineciency

from Negative Externality (Figure 6.4)) will tend to have more of the good or activity than is socially
optimal because the agents are not paying attention to all the costs. Too much oil will be shipped, and
with insucient care; people will drive too many miles on their daily commutes; developers will build too
many new homes in sensitive habitats. Thus, there is deadweight loss (the shaded triangle in the gure);
the marginal social cost associated with units in excess of the social optimum is greater than the marginal
benet society gets from those units. Public policy that reduces the amount of the harmful good or activity
could make society as a whole better o.
Figure 6.4: Ineciency from Negative Externality When there is a negative externality, the
market equilibrates where the total social marginal cost exceeds the marginal benet of the last unit of
a good and society is not as well o as it could be if less were produced. Source: Amy Ando6
Conversely, a positive externality is a benet associated with an action that is not borne by the person
who chooses to take that action. Students who get u shots in October, for example, gain a private benet
because they are less likely to get the u during the winter months. However, their classmates, roommates,
and relatives also gain some benet from that action because inoculated students are less likely to pass the u

along to them. Positive externalities exist in the world of actions and products that aect the environment:
• A homeowner who installs a rain barrel to collect unchlorinated rainwater for her garden also improves
stream habitat in her watershed by reducing stormwater runo.
• A delivery company that re-optimizes its routing system to cut fuel costs also improves local air quality
by cutting its vehicle air pollution emissions.
• A farmer who plants winter cover crops to increase the productivity of his soil will also improve water
quality in local streams by reducing erosion.
In situations where an action or good has a positive externality, the private marginal benet that shapes
the behavior of an agent is lower than the marginal benet to society as a whole, which includes the private
marginal benet and the external environmental marginal benet. The ecient outcome would be where
the social marginal cost equals the social marginal benet (labeled Qecient in Figure Positive Externality
(Figure 6.5)). In the presence of a positive externality, the free-market outcome will tend to promote less of
the good or activity than is socially optimal because the agents do not reap all the benets. Too few rain
barrels will be installed; not enough delivery routes will be re-optimized; too few acres of agricultural elds
will have cover crops in the winter months. Again there is deadweight loss (the shaded triangle in the gure),
but this time because the marginal social benet associated with some of the units not produced would have
been greater than the marginal costs of producing them. Just because an externality is positive rather than
negative doesn't mean there isn't a problem; public policy could still make society as a whole better o.

6.2.5 Public Goods and Common-pool Resources
Market outcomes are almost never ecient in two broad kinds of cases: public goods and common-pool
resources. The market failures in these settings are related to the problems we saw with negative and
positive externalities.
A pure public good is dened as being nonexclusive and nonrival in consumption. If something is
nonexclusive, people cannot be prevented from enjoying its benets. A private house is exclusive because
doors, windows, and an alarm system can be used to keep nonowners out. A lighthouse, on the other hand,
is non-exclusive because ships at sea cannot be prevented from seeing its light. A good that is nonrival in
consumption has a marginal benet that does not decline with the number of people who consume it. A hot
dog is completely rival in consumption: if I eat it, you cannot. On the other hand, the beauty of a reworks
display is completely unaected by the number of people who look at it. Some elements of the environment
are pure public goods:

242 CHAPTER 6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
• Clean air in a city provides health benets to everyone, and people cannot be prevented from breathing
• The stratospheric ozone layer protects everyone on earth from solar UV radiation
The ecient amount of a public good is still where social marginal benet equals the marginal cost of
provision. However, the social marginal benet of one unit of a public good is often very large because many
people in society can benet from that unit simultaneously. One lighthouse prevents all the ships in an area
from running aground in a storm. In contrast, the social marginal benet of a hot dog is just the marginal
benet gained by the one person who gets to eat it.
Society could gure out the ecient amount of a public good to providesay, how much to spend on
cleaner cars that reduce air pollution in a city. Unfortunately, private individuals acting on their own are
unlikely to provide the ecient amount of the public good because of the free rider problem. If my neighbors
reduce pollution by buying clean electric cars or commuting via train, I can benet from that cleaner air;
thus, I might try to avoid doing anything costly myself in hopes that everyone else will clean the air for
me. Evidence suggests that people do not behave entirely like free riders  they contribute voluntarily to
environmental groups and public radio stations. However, the levels of public-good provision generated by a
free market are lower than would be ecient. The ozone layer is too thin; the air is too dirty. Public goods
have big multilateral positive externality problems.
In contrast, a common-pool resource (also sometimes called an open-access resource) suers from big
multilateral negative externality problems. This situation is sometimes called the tragedy of the commons.
Like public goods, common-pool resources are nonexcludable. However, they are highly rival in use. Many
natural resources have common-pool features:
• Water in a river can be removed by anyone near it for irrigation, drinking, or industrial use; the more
water one set of users removes, the less water there is available for others.
• Swordsh in the ocean can be caught by anyone with the right boat and gear, and the more sh are
caught by one eet of boats, the fewer remain for other shers to catch.
• Old growth timber in a developing country can be cut down by many people, and slow regrowth means
that the more timber one person cuts the less there is available for others.
One person's use of a common-pool resource has negative eects on all the other users. Thus, these resources
are prone to overexploitation. One person in Indonesia might want to try to harvest tropical hardwood timber
slowly and sustainably, but the trees they forebear from cutting today might be cut down by someone else
tomorrow. The diculty of managing common-pool resources is evident around the world in rapid rates of
tropical deforestation, dangerous overharvesting of sheries (see Case study: Marine Fisheries (Section 6.3)),
and battles fought over mighty rivers that have been reduced to dirty trickles.
The tragedy of the commons occurs most often when the value of the resource is great, the number of
users is large, and the users do not have social ties to one another, but common-pool resources are not always
abused. Elinor Ostrom's Nobel prize-winning body of work, for example, has studied cases of common-pool
resources that were not over-exploited because of informal social institutions.

6.3 Case Study: Marine Fisheries8
Fisheries are classic common-pool resources. The details of the legal institutions that govern access to
sheries vary around the globe. However, the physical nature of marine sheries makes them prone to
overexploitation. Anyone with a boat and some gear can enter the ocean. One boat's catch reduces the sh
available to all the other boats and reduces the stock available to reproduce and sustain the stock available
in the following year. Economic theory predicts that the market failure associated with open access to a
shery will yield socially excessive levels of entry into the shery (too many boats) and annual catch (too
many sh caught) and ineciently low stocks of sh (Beddington, Agnew, & Clark, 2007 (p. 246)).
Figure 6.6: Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration9
Unfortunately, the state of sheries around the globe seems to indicate that the predictions of that theory
are being borne out. Bluen tuna are in danger of extinction. Stocks of sh in once-abundant sheries such
as North Atlantic cod and Mediterranean swordsh have been depleted to commercial (and sometimes
biological) exhaustion (Montaigne, 2007 (p. 246)). Scientists have documented widespread collapse of sh
stocks and associated loss of marine biodiversity from overshing; this devastates the ability of coastal
and open-ocean ecosystems to provide a wide range of ecosystem services such as food provisioning, water
ltration, and detoxication (Worm et al., 2006 (p. 246)). Scholars have documented isolated cases such as

the lobster gangs of coastal Maine where communal informal management prevented overexploitation of
the resource (Acheson, 1988 (p. 246)), but such cases are the exception rather than the rule.
Early eorts to control overshing used several kinds of regulations on quotas, shing eort, and gear.
For example, shing boats are forbidden in some places from using conventional longlines because that gear
yields high levels of bycatch and kills endangered leatherback turtles. Some forms of shery management
limit the number of sh that can be caught in an entire shery. Under a total allowable catch (TAC) system,
shers can sh when and how they want, but once the quota for the shery has been met, shing must
stop until the next season. Unfortunately, TAC policies do not solve the underlying problem that shermen
compete for the sh, and often yield perverse incentives and undesirable outcomes such as overcapitalization
of the industry (Beddington, Agnew, & Clark, 2007 (p. 246)) and races between shing boat crews to catch
sh before the quota is reached. In the well-known case of the Alaskan halibut shery, the race became so
extreme that the shing season was reduced to a single 24-hour mad dash; given that sh are perishable,
this temporal clumping of the catch is not a desirable outcome.

246 CHAPTER 6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
Resource economists developed the idea of a tradable permit scheme to help manage sheries. Individual
tradable quota (ITQ) schemes are cap-and-trade policies for sh, where total catch is limited but shers in
the shery are given permits that guarantee them a right to a share of that catch. Players in the shery
can sell their quota shares to each other (helping the catch to ow voluntarily to the most ecient boats
in the industry) and there is no incentive for captains to buy excessively large boats or sh too rapidly to
beat the other boats to the catch. ITQ policies have rationalized the Alaskan halibut shery completely:
the sh stock is thriving, overcapitalization is gone, and the sh catch is spread out over time (Levy, 2010
(p. 246)). ITQs have also been implemented in the sheries of New Zealand, yielding large improvements
in the biological status of the stocks (Annala, 1996 (p. 246)). There is some general evidence that ITQ
systems have been relatively successful in improving shery outcomes (Costello, Gaines, & Lynham et al.
2008 (p. 246)), though other research implies that evidence of the superiority of the ITQ approach is more
mixed (Beddington 2007 (p. 246)) Scholars and shery managers continue to work to identify the details of
ITQ management that make such systems work most eectively, and to identify what needs to be done to
promote more widespread adoption of good shery management policy worldwide.

6.4.2 Use Values
Externality, public good, and common-pool resource problems yield suboptimal levels of environmental
quality and excessive rates of resource exploitation. Many factors complicate the process of deciding what
to do about these problems. One is that environmental goods are not traded in any marketplace, and hence
analysts struggle to identify quantitative measures of their values to society.
Environmental valuation is controversial. Some environmentalists object to eorts to place dollar values
on elements of the environment that might be viewed as priceless. Such values are important, however, for
making sure that society does not fail to take the value of nature into account when making policy and
investment choices. All U.S. government regulations, for example, are subjected to benet-cost analyses
to make sure that government actions don't inadvertently make society worse o (see Module Evaluating
Projects and Policies (Section 6.5)). If we do not have dollar values for the environmental benets of things
like clean water and air, then estimates of the benets of pollution control will be consistently lower than
the true social benets, and government policy will chronically underinvest in eorts to control pollution.
Environmental and natural resource economists have worked for decades to develop valuation methods
that can be used to generate reasonable estimates of the dollar values of environmental amenities. Thousands
of journal articles have been published in this eort to rene valuation methodology. In the early years of
valuation studies, most of the work was focused on generating estimates of the social values of water and
air quality. Over time, economists broadened their focus to study how to value a broader range of amenities
such as wetland habitat and endangered species.
The United Nations launched an international eort in 2000 called the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
which was to evaluate the current state of earth's ecosystems (and the services that ow from nature to
humans) and identify strategies for conservation and sustainable use. Reports from this eort13 ) have helped
scientists and policy makers develop a new framework for thinking about how nature has value to humans
by providing a wide range of ecosystem services. Since then, a surge of multidisciplinary research has
emerged to quantify the physical services provided by the environment and estimate the values to humanity
of those services. Economists recognize two broad categories of environmental values: use and non-use. Use
values ow from services that aect people directly, such as food production, ood regulation, recreation
opportunities, and potable water provision. Non-use values are less tangible: the desire for endangered
tigers to continue to exist even on the part of people who will never see them in the wild; concern about
bequeathing future generations a planet with healthy sh populations; a sense that people have an ethical
responsibility to be good stewards of the earth. Economic valuation methods exist to capture all of these
environmental values.

250 CHAPTER 6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
6.4.3 Willingness to Pay/Accept
Economists use measures of value that are anthropocentric, or human centered. A rigorous body of theory
about consumer choice lies beneath those measures. Mathematical complexity can make that theory seem
like unreliable trickery, but in truth, consumer theory rests on only a very small number of fundamental
assumptions:
• People have preferences over things.
• People are able to rank any two bundles of goods to identify which one they prefer.
• People are rational in that they will choose the bundle they prefer (over bundles they do not prefer) if
they can aord it.
Those uncontroversial axioms are actually enough to derive all the results economists use when working with
valuation methodology. However, the derivations are easier and sometimes more intuitive with a little more
structure added to our hypothetical consumer choice problem:
• People face budget constraints (total expenditures can't exceed their income).
• People make choices to make themselves as well o as possible (maximize their utility) within the
rationing forced by their budget constraints.
This framework yields two ways to think about the values of changes to the quality or quantity of environmental goods. Consider rst a situation where we are trying to determine the value of a project that
yields an environmental improvementsay, for example, water in the Chicago River will be cleaner. The
social benet of that project turns out to be what people are willing to pay for it. The second measure of
value is appropriate if we want to measure the value of environmental goods that will be lost or degraded
by a deleterious changesay, for example, climate change leading to the extinction of polar bears. In that
context, the value of the change is given by the amount of money you would have to pay people in order to
make them willing to accept it.
Willingness to pay (WTP) is a budget-constrained measure of a change in welfare; a person cannot
be willing to pay more money for a change than they have income. In contrast, willingness to accept
(WTA) is not a budget constrained measure of valueyou might have to increase a person's income many
times over in order to fully compensate them for the loss of an environmental amenity they hold dearand
can theoretically approach innity. Empirical studies tend to nd that WTA value estimates are larger than
equivalent estimates of WTP.
Analysts usually choose whether to use WTA or WTP approaches as a function of the context of the
analysis. The right measure to use may depend on whether you want value estimates to inform a policy
that would improve conditions relative to the current legal status quo, or to understand the consequences of
a change that would cause deterioration of some environmental good citizens currently enjoy. Another factor
in choosing a valuation method is that WTP is budget constrained while WTA is not. WTP estimates of
value tend to be lower in places where people have lower incomes. That variation captures a realistic pattern
in the size of willingness to pay for environmental improvements. However, equity problems clearly plague
a study that concludes, for example, that improvements in air quality are more valuable to society if they
happen in rich areas rather than poor.
All valuation methodologiesWTP and WTAare designed to estimate values of fairly small changes in
the environment, and those values are often setting-specic. Careful analysts can do benet transfer studies
in which they use the results of one valuation study to inform value estimates in a dierent place. However,
such applications must be carried out carefully. The value of a unit change in a measure of environmental
integrity is not an immutable constant, and the values of very large changes in either quantity or quality of
an environmental amenity usually cannot be estimated. A cautionary example is an inuential but widely
criticized paper published in Nature by Robert Costanza and colleagues that carried out sweeping benet
transfer estimates of the total social values of a number of Earth's biomes (open oceans, forests, wetlands,
etc.). The resulting estimates were too large to be correct estimates of WTP because they exceeded the
value of the whole world's GDP, and too small to be correct estimates of WTA because life on earth would

251
cease to exist if oceans disappeared, so WTA for that change should be innity (Costanza et al., 1997 (p.
253)).
6.4.4 An Economist's Environmental Valuation Toolkit: Direct, Revealed Preference, and Stated Preference Methods
Early work on environmental valuation estimated the benets of improved environmental quality using direct
methods that exploit easily obtained information about the monetary damage costs of pollution. These
methods are still sometimes used (most often by people who are not environmental economists) because
of their simple intuitive appeal. An analyst can measure costs associated with pollution; the benets of
environmental cleanup are then the reductions in those costs. Following are some examples:
• Production damage measures: Pollution has a deleterious eect on many production processes. For
example, air pollution lowers corn yields, thus increasing the cost of producing a bushel of corn. An
analyst could try to measure the benets of eliminating air pollution by calculating the increase in net
social benets that would ow from the corn market as a result of higher yields.
• Avoided cost measures: Environmental degradation often forces people to spend money on eorts to
mitigate the harm caused by that degradation. One benet of reversing the degradation is not having
to spend that money on mitigationthe avoided cost. For example, hydrological disruption from
impervious surfaces in urban areas forces cities to spend money on expensive storm sewer infrastructure
to try to reduce oods. A benet of installing rain gardens and green roofs to manage stormwater
might be avoided storm sewer infrastructure costs.
• Health cost measures: Pollution has adverse eects on human health. For example, toxic chemicals
can cause cancer, and ground level ozone causes asthma. Some measures of the damages caused by
pollution simply count the nancial costs of such illnesses, including the costs of cancer treatment and
lost wages from adults missing work during asthma attacks.
These measures seem appealing, but are in fact deeply problematic. One of the most serious problems
with direct measures is that they often yield woefully incomplete estimates of the benets of environmental
cleanup. Consider the example of cancer above. Suppose a woman gets cancer from drinking contaminated
well water. By the time her illness is diagnosed, the cancer is so advanced that doctors can do little to treat
her, and she dies a few months later. The medical expenditures associated with this illness are not very large;
she and her family would surely have been willing to pay much more money to have eliminated the toxins
so she did not ever get sick. The direct health cost measure of the benets of cleaning up the contaminated
water is a serious underestimate of the true benet to society of that environmental improvement.
A second set of valuation tools called revealed preference methods work to estimate WTP for environmental amenities and quality by exploiting data on actual behaviors and market choices that are related
to the environmental good in question. People reveal their WTP for environmental goods with their actions.
Three examples of such methods are below.
• Hedonic price analysis: We often cannot observe individuals taking direct action to change the quality
of the environment to which they are exposed in a given location because they simply cannot eect
such change; no one person, for example, can reduce the concentration of ne particles in the air near
his house. We do, however, observe market data about the choices people make about where to live.
If two houses are otherwise identical but one house is situated in a place with much cleaner air than
the other, the benet of breathing cleaner air will get capitalized in the value of that house. All else
equal, neighborhoods with better environments will have more expensive homes. Analysts can gather
data on housing prices and house characteristics (both environmental and nonenvironmental) and use
a statistical analysis to estimate marginal WTP for elements of environmental quality that vary among
the houses in the data set. The hedonic price analysis approach has been used to value amenities
such as air quality, hazardous waste site cleanup, and open space.

252 CHAPTER 6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
• Hedonic wage analysis: Some forms of pollution cause people to face higher risk of death in any given
year. Thus, one important goal of valuation is to estimate a dollar value of reduced mortality resulting
from pollution cleanup. Except in the movies, we rarely observe people choosing how much money
they are willing to pay to save a specic person from certain death. However, all of us make choices
every day that aect our risk of death. One important choice is which job to accept. Elementary
school teachers face little job-related mortality risk. In contrast, coal miners, oshore oil rig workers,
and deep sea shermen accept high rates of accidental death when they take their jobs. By analyzing
data on wage rates and worker death rates in a variety of dierent industries, we can estimate WTP
to reduce the risk of death. Using such hedonic wage analysis, economists have developed measures
of the value of a statistical life (VSL), which can be applied to physical estimates of reductions in
pollution-related deaths to nd the benets of reduced mortality.
• Travel cost analysis: Many natural amenities, such as forests, lakes, and parks are enjoyed by the
public free of charge. While there is no formal market for hours of quality outdoor recreation, people
do incur costs associated with such recreationgas purchased to drive to the site, hotel expenses for
overnight trips, and the opportunity cost of the time spent on the trip. If environmental quality is
valued, people will be willing to pay higher travel costs to visit recreation sites with higher levels of
environmental quality (e.g., cleaner water in the lake, more sh to catch, a better view from a mountain
with low air pollution). In travel cost analysis, researchers gather data on the environmental features
of a set of recreation sites and the choices people make about visiting those siteswhich they choose
to visit, and how oftenand apply statistical analysis to those data to estimate WTP for improved
quality of natural amenities.
One of the greatest strengths of revealed preference valuation methods is that they use information about
real behavior rather than hypothetical choices. These approaches also yield estimates of WTP that are often
more complete than the results of direct market measure studies.
Revealed preference studies do, however, have weaknesses and limitations. First, they only give good
estimates of WTP for environmental goods if people have full and accurate information about environmental
quality and associated risks. For example, hedonic estimates of WTP to avoid living with polluted air will
be biased downward if people in a city do not know how air pollution varies among neighborhoods. Second,
some revealed preference approaches are only valid if the relevant markets (labor markets for a wage study,
housing markets for a hedonic price study) are not plagued by market power and transaction costs that
prevent ecient equilibria from being reached. For example, if workers nd it too daunting and costly
to move from one region to another, then coal miners may fail to earn the wage premium that would be
associated with such a risky job in the absence of relocation hurdles. Third, revealed preference approaches
cannot be used to estimate values for levels of environmental quality that are not observed in real-world
data. If all the lakes in a region are terribly polluted, we cannot use a travel cost study of lake site choice
to identify WTP for very clean lakes. Fourth, revealed preference methods can capture only use values, not
non-use values.
The limitations of revealed preference valuation tools motivated environmental and natural resource
economists to develop valuation methods that do not require analysts to be able to observe real-world
behavior related to the amenity being valued. These stated preference methods are now highly rened,
but the essential idea is simple. These studies design a survey that presents people with information about
hypothetical scenarios involving an environmental good, gather data on their responses to questions about
how much they would pay for something or whether they would choose one scenario over another, and then
analyze the data to estimate WTP for the good or WTA compensation for elimination or degradation of the
good.
• Contingent valuation: The methodology called contingent valuation (or CV) gained prominent attention when it was used by economists to estimate the damage done to society by the oil spilled by
Exxon's Valdez oil tanker in Prince William Sound in 1989 (Carson et al., 2003 (p. 253)). A CV survey
gives a clear description of a single environmental amenity to be valued, such as a wetland restoration,

253
whale populations, or improved water quality in a local lake. The description includes details about
how the amenity would be created, and how the survey respondent would pay any money they claim
to be willing to pay in support of the amenity. Respondents are then asked a question to elicit their
WTP. This value elicitation question can be open ended (How much would you be willing to pay in
taxes to increase whale populations?) or closed ended (Would you be willing to pay $30 to increase
whale populations?). The resulting data set is analyzed to nd the average WTP of people in the
sample population.
• Conjoint analysis: Conjoint analysis is also referred to as choice experiment survey analysis. It was
developed rst by analysts in business marketing and psychology, and only later adopted by economists
for environmental valuation. The main dierence between conjoint analysis and CV is that CV elicits
WTP for an environmental amenity with a single xed bundle of features, or attributes. Conjoint
analysis estimates separate values for each of a set of attributes of a composite environmental amenity.
For example, grasslands can vary in bird species diversity, wildower coverage, and distance from human
population centers. A conjoint analysis of grassland ecosystems would construct a set of hypothetical
grasslands with varied combinations of attributes (including the cost to the respondent of a chosen
grassland). The survey would present respondents with several choice questions; in each choice, the
respondent would be asked to pick which of several hypothetical grasslands they would prefer. The
resulting data would be analyzed to nd how each attribute aects the likelihood that one grassland is
preferred over another. This would yield estimates of marginal values for each attribute; those values
could then be used to nd WTP for composite grasslands with many dierent combinations of features.
Both CV and conjoint analysis methods can be designed to estimate WTP for improvement or WTA degradation depending on which context is most appropriate for the problem at hand. These stated preference
methods have two main strengths. First, they can capture non-use values. Second, their hypothetical nature
allows analysts to estimate WTP for improvements out of the range of current experience (or WTA for
degradation we have fortunately not yet experienced).
However, stated preferences approaches do have weaknesses and limitations. For example, many
economists are uncomfortable using value estimates derived from hypothetical choices, worrying whether
consumers would make the same choices regarding payment for public environmental goods if the payments
were real. Scholars also worry about whether people give responses to stated preference surveys that are
deliberately skewed from their true WTP. Understatements of value could arise to protest a government
policy (Why should I have to pay to clean up the environment when someone else made it dirty in the rst
place?) or out of a desire to free ride. Finally, the hypothetical nature of stated preference surveys can
mean that some respondents are not familiar with the thing being valued, and thus may have trouble giving meaningful responses to the questions. Stated preference surveys must be designed to give respondents
enough information without biasing their responses.

6.5 Evaluating Projects and Policies16
6.5.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• know ve important features of how economists think about costs
• understand why discounting is both important and controversial, and be able to calculate the net
present value of a project or policy
• know what cost-benet analysis is, and be aware of some of its limitations
• think about four criteria for evaluating a project that are not captured in a basic cost-benet analysis
6.5.2 Introduction
Environmental valuation methods help analysts to evaluate the benets society would gain from policies or
cleanup and restoration projects that improve environmental quality or better steward our natural resources.
Another set of tools can yield information about the costs of such actions (a brief description is below). But
even if we have plausible estimates of the costs and benets of something, more work needs to be done to
put all that information together and make some rational choices about public policy and investments. This
module discusses the challenges of policy evaluation when costs and benets accrue over time, outlines the
main features of cost-benet analysis, and presents several other criteria for policy evaluation.
6.5.3 Net Present Value, Discounting, and Cost-benet Analysis
Cost estimation has not generated the same amount of scholarly research as benet valuation because the
process of estimating the costs of environmental improvement is usually more straightforward than the
process of estimating the benets. Economists do think dierently about costs than engineers or other
physical scientists, and several key insights about the economics of cost evaluation are important for policy
analysis. Viewed through an inverse lens, all these ideas are important for benet estimation as well.
6.5.3.1 Opportunity Cost
Not all costs involve actual outlays of money. An opportunity cost is the foregone benet of something that
we choose (or are forced) not to do. The opportunity cost of a year of graduate school is the money you
could have made if you had instead gotten a full-time job right after college. Endangered species protection
has many opportunity costs: timber in old-growth forests can't be cut and sold; critical habitat in urban
areas can't be developed into housing and sold to people who want to live in the area. Opportunity costs
do not appear on rms' or governments' accounting sheets and are thus often overlooked in estimates of the
costs of a policy. Studies of U.S. expenditures on endangered species' recoveries have used only information
about costs like direct government expenditures because opportunity costs are so challenging to measure
(e.g. Dawson and Shogren, 2001 (p. 260)).

the value of ecosystems. Cutting down the forest therefore has an opportunity cost that is hard to
measure, and this can bias people and governments towards resource extraction. Source: Photo by

6.5.3.2 Transfers Are Not Costs
Cost totals should only include real changes in behavior or resource use, and not transfers of money from
one party to another. For example, imagine a program in which a wastewater treatment plant can pay a

farmer for the cost of taking land out of production and installing a wetland on the land that will soak up
nutrients that would otherwise ow into a local river. The cost of those nutrient reductions is the cost of
installing the wetland and the opportunity cost of the foregone farming activity. If payments for multiple
services are permitted, the farmer might also be able to get paid by a conservation group for the wildlife
benet associated with the new wetland. However, that additional payment to the farmer is a pure transfer.
The social cost of the wetland has not gone up just because the farmer was paid more for it.
6.5.3.3 Use the Correct Counterfactual
Many cursory analyses of the costs of a policy nd the dierence between the cost of something before and
after the policy was put in place and claim that any increase was caused by the policy. For example, the
U.S. government put temporary restrictions on oshore oil drilling after the Deepwater Horizon explosion
and oil spill to consider new environmental regulations on such drilling. After those restrictions were put
in place, the price of crude oil in the U.S. went up. A sloppy analysis would attribute all the costs of that
price increase to the drilling restrictions. However, during the same period of 2010, the U.S. economy was
beginning to pull out of a very deep recession; this caused increased manufacturing activity and consumer
driving, and thus an increased call for fossil-fuel energy. Therefore, some of the increase in oil prices might
have been driven by the increased demand for oil. A careful analysis would compare the price of oil with the
restrictions in place to what the price of oil would have been during the same time period if the restrictions
had not been implementedthat hypothetical scenario is the true counterfactual.
6.5.3.4 Additionality
A careful analysis of the costs of a program includes only costs that are additional, that is, new additions to
costs that would have existed even in the absence of the program. For example, current regulations require
developers to use temporary controls while constructing a new building to prevent large amounts of sediment
from being washed into local rivers and lakes. Suppose EPA wants to estimate the costs of a new regulation
that further requires new development to be designed such that stormwater doesn't run o the site after the
building is nished. A proper analysis would not include the costs of the temporary stormwater controls
in the estimate of the cost of the new regulation, because those temporary controls would be required even
in the absence of the new regulation (Braden and Ando, 2011 (p. 260)). The concept of additionality
has been made famous in the context of benet estimation by a debate over whether programs that pay
landowners not to deforest their lands have benets that are additional; some of those lands might not have
been deforested even without the payments, or the landowners may receive conservation payments from
multiple sources for the same activity.
6.5.3.5 Control for Associated Market Changes
A careful cost analysis must pay attention to market changes associated with cost increases. To illustrate,
suppose the government is thinking of passing a ban on agricultural use of methyl bromide. This ozonedepleting chemical is widely used as an agricultural fumigant, and is particularly important in strawberry
production and shipping. A ban on methyl bromide might, therefore, increase the marginal cost of producing
strawberries. A simple approach to estimating the cost of the proposed methyl bromide ban would be to nd
out how many strawberries were sold before the ban and calculate the increase in the total cost of producing
that many strawberries. However, the increase in production costs will drive up the price of strawberries
and lower the number of strawberries sold in the marketplace. There is a cost to society with two parts:
(a) deadweight loss associated with the net benets of the strawberries not sold, and (b) the increased cost
of producing the strawberries that still are sold. That total social cost is lower, however, than the estimate
yielded by the simple approach outlined above because the simple approach includes increased production
costs for strawberries that are not sold. An accurate cost estimate must take into account market changes.
The concept of net benets was introduced above; in the context of policy or project evaluation, net
benets are, quite simply, the dierence between the benets and the costs of a policy in a given year.

257
However, environmental policies typically have benets and costs that play out over a long period of time,
and those ows are often not the same in every year. For example, wetland restoration in agricultural areas
has a large xed cost at the beginning of the project when the wetland is constructed and planted. Every year
after that there is an opportunity cost associated with foregone farm income from the land in the wetland,
but that annual cost is probably lower than the xed construction cost. The wetland will yield benets to
society by preventing the ow of some nitrogen and phosphorus into nearby streams and by providing habitat
for waterfowl and other animals. However, the wildlife benets will be low in the early years, increasing
over time as the restored wetland vegetation grows and matures. It is not too dicult to calculate the net
benets of the restoration project in each year, but a dierent methodology is needed to evaluate the net
benets of the project over its lifetime.
Some analysts simply add up all the costs and benets for the years that they accrue. However, that
approach assumes implicitly that we are indierent between costs and benets we experience now and those
we experience in the future. That assumption is invalid for two reasons. First, empirical evidence has shown
that humans are impatient and prefer benets today over benets tomorrow. One need only ask a child
whether they want to eat a candy bar today or next week in order to see that behavior at work. Second,
the world is full of investment opportunities (both nancial and physical). Money today is worth more than
money tomorrow because we could invest the money today and earn a rate of return. Thus, if there is a cost
to environmental cleanup, we would rather pay those costs in the future than pay them now.
Economists have developed a tool for comparing net benets at dierent points in time called discounting. Discounting converts a quantity of money received at some point in the future into a quantity that can
be directly compared to money received today, controlling for the time preference described above. To do
this, an analyst assumes a discount rate r, where r ranges commonly between zero and ten percent depending
on the application. If we denote the net benets t years from now as V t(in the current year, t=0), then we
say the present discounted value of V t is PDV (Vt) = Vt
(1+r)

$10,000 declines with time, and how the rate of the decrease varies with the choice of discount rate r. If a

A particular cost or benet is worth less in present value terms the farther into the future it accrues
and the higher the value of the discount rate. These fundamental features of discounting create controversy
over the use of discounting because they make projects to deal with long-term environmental problems seem
unappealing. The most pressing example of such controversy swirls around analysis of climate-change policy.
Climate-change mitigation policies typically incur immediate economic costs (e.g. switching from fossil fuels
to more expensive forms of energy) to prevent environmental damages from climate change several decades
in the future. Discounting lowers the present value of the future improved environment while leaving the
present value of current costs largely unchanged.
Cost-benet analysis is just that: analysis of the costs and benets of a proposed policy or project.
To carry out a cost-benet analysis, one carefully species the change to be evaluated, measures the costs
and benets of that change for all years that will be aected by the change, nds the totals of the presented
discounted values of those costs and benets, and compares them. Some studies look at the dierence
between the benets and the costs (the net present value), while others look at the ratio of benets to costs.
A good project is one with a net present value greater than zero and a benet/cost ratio greater than one.
The result of a cost-benet analysis depends on a large number of choices and assumptions. What
discount rate is assumed? What is the status quo counterfactual against which the policy is evaluated?
How are the physical eects of the policy being modeled? Which costs and benets are included in the
analysisare non-use benets left out? Good cost-benet analyses should make all their assumptions clear
and transparent. Even better practice explores whether the results of the analysis are sensitive to assumptions
about things like the discount rate (a practice called sensitivity analysis). Scandal erupted in 2000 when

a whistle-blower revealed that the Army Corps of Engineers was pressuring its sta to alter assumptions to
make sure a cost-benet analysis yielded a particular result (EDV&CBN, 2000 (p. 260)). Transparency and
sensitivity analysis can help to prevent such abuses.
6.5.4 Eciency, Cost Eectiveness, Innovation, and Equity
Cost-benet analysis gives us a rough sense of whether or not a project is a good idea. However, it has many
limitations. Here we discuss several other measures of whether a project is desirable. Economists use all
these criteria and more when evaluating whether a policy is the right approach for solving a problem with
externalities, public goods, and common-pool resources.
6.5.4.1 Eciency
A policy is ecient if it maximizes the net benets society could get from an action of that kind. Many
projects and policies can pass a cost-benet test but still not be ecient. Several levels of carbon dioxide
emission reduction, for example, could have benets exceeding costs, but only one will have the largest
dierence between benets and costs possible. Such eciency will occur when the marginal benets of the
policy are equal to its marginal costs. Sometimes a cost-benet analysis will try to estimate the total costs
and benets for several policies with dierent degrees of stringency to try to see if one is better than the
others. However, only information about the marginal benet and marginal cost curves will ensure that the
analyst has found the ecient policy. Unfortunately, such information is often very hard to nd or estimate.
6.5.4.2 Cost Eectiveness
As we saw in the Module Environmental Valuation (Section 6.4), it can be particularly dicult to
estimate the benets of environmental policy, and benet estimates are necessary for nding ecient policies.
Sometimes policy goals are just set through political processesreducing sulfur dioxide emissions by 10
million tons below 1980 levels in the Clean Air Act acid rain provisions, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by
5% from 1990 levels in the Kyoto protocolwithout being able to know whether those targets are ecient.
However, we can still evaluate whether a policy will be cost eective and achieve its goal in the least
expensive way possible. For example, for total pollution reduction to be distributed cost-eectively between
all the sources that contribute pollution to an area (e.g. a lake or an urban airshed), it must be true that
each of the sources is cleaning up such that they all face the same marginal costs of further abatement. If
one source had a high marginal cost and another's marginal cost was very low, total cost could be reduced
by switching some of the cleanup from the rst source to the second.
6.5.4.3 Incentives to Innovate:
At any one point in time, the cost of pollution control or resource recovery depends on the current state
of technology and knowledge. For example, the cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels
depends in part on how expensive solar and wind power are, and the cost of wetland restoration depends on
how quickly ecologists are able to get new wetland plants to be established. Everyone in society benets if
those technologies improve and the marginal cost of any given level of environmental stewardship declines.
Thus, economists think a lot about which kinds of policies do the best job of giving people incentives to
develop cheaper ways to clean and steward the environment.
6.5.4.4 Fairness
A project can have very high aggregate net benets, but distribute the costs and benets very unevenly
within society. We may have both ethical and practical reasons not to want a policy that is highly unfair.
Some people have strong moral or philosophical preferences for policies that are equitable. In addition, if
the costs of a policy are borne disproportionately by a single group of people or rms, that group is likely
to ght against it in the political process. Simple cost-benet analyses do not speak to issues of equity.

260 CHAPTER 6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
However, it is common for policy analyses to break total costs and benets down among subgroups to see
if uneven patterns exist in their distribution. Studies can break down policy eects by income category to
see if a policy helps or hurts people disproportionately depending on whether they are wealthy or poor.
Other analyses carry out regional analyses of policy eects. . For example, climate-change mitigation policy
increases costs disproportionately for poor households because of patterns in energy consumption across
income groups. Furthermore, the benets and costs of such policy are not uniform across space in the U.S.
The benets of reducing the severity of climate change will accrue largely to those areas that would be hurt
most by global warming (coastal states hit by sea level rise and more hurricanes, Western states hit by severe
water shortages) while the costs will fall most heavily on regions of the country with economies dependent
on sales of oil and coal.
Some of our evaluative criteria are closely related to each other; a policy cannot be ecient if it is not
cost-eective. However, other criteria have nothing to do with each other; a policy can be ecient but not
equitable, and vice versa. Cost-benet analyses provide crude litmus testswe surely do not want to adopt
policies that have costs exceeding their benets. However, good policy development and evaluation considers
a broader array of criteria.
6.5.5 Review Questions

6.6 Solutions: Property Rights, Regulations, and Incentive Policies20
6.6.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• know why having clearly dened property rights might improve environmental outcomes and be aware
of the limitations of that approach
• dene several dierent types of command and control regulations, and understand their comparative
advantages
• know what incentive policies (taxes and tradable permits) are, what they do, and what their strengths
and weaknesses are
6.6.2 Introduction
Governments have implemented many policies to solve problems with environmental quality and natural
resource depletion. Every policy is unique and deserves detailed individual analysis in the policymaking
processthe devil is always in the details. However, economists have developed a taxonomy of policy types.
This taxonomy helps us to understand general principles about how policies of dierent types are likely to
perform and under which circumstances they are likely to work best. Policies are broadly characterized as
either command-and-control or incentive policies. Command and control includes several types of standards.
Incentive policies include taxes, tradable permits, and liability.
6.6.3 Property Rights
In 1960, Ronald Coase wrote the pioneering article "The Problem of Social Cost" in which he put forth ideas
about externalities that have come to be known as the Coase theorem (Coase, 1960 (p. 266)). The basic
idea of the Coase theorem is that if property rights over a resource are well specied, and if the parties with
an interest in that resource can bargain freely, then the parties will negotiate an outcome that is ecient
regardless of who has the rights over the resource. The initial allocation of rights will not aect the eciency
of the outcome, but it will aect the distribution of wealth between the parties because the party with the
property rights can extract payment from the other parties as part of the agreement.
To bring this abstract idea to life, we will draw on the classic example employed by generations of
economists to think about the Coase theorem. Suppose a farmer and a rancher live next door to each other.
There is land between them on which the farmer wants to plant crops, but the rancher's cows keep eating
the crops. The farmer would like to have no cows on the land, and the rancher would like the farmer to stop
planting crops so the cows could eat as much grass as they like. The ecient outcome is where the marginal
benet of a cow to the rancher is just equal to the marginal cost to the farmer of that cow's grazing. If the
farmer is given property rights over the land, the rancher will have an incentive to pay the farmer to allow
the ecient number of cows rather than zero; if the rancher has the rights, then the farmer will have to pay
the rancher to limit the herd to just the ecient size. Either way they have incentives to negotiate to the
ecient outcome because otherwise both of them could be made better o.
The Coase theorem is invoked by some scholars and policy analysts to argue that government policy is
not needed to correct problems of externalities; all you need is property rights, and private negotiations will
take care of the rest. However, Coase himself recognized in his writing that often the real world does not
have the frictionless perfect negotiation on which the conclusions of the theorem rest. For example, there
are transaction costs in bargaining, and those transaction costs can be prohibitively large when many people
are involved, as in the case of air pollution from a factory. Furthermore, perfect bargaining requires perfect
information. People often are unaware of the threats posed to their health by air and water pollution, and
thus do not know what kind of bargaining would actually be in their own best interests.

262 CHAPTER 6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
Despite these limitations, there is a move afoot to use property right development to eect environmental
improvement and improve natural resource stewardship, particularly in developing countries. In parts of
Africa, new systems have given villages property rights over wildlife on their lands, yielding stronger incentives
to manage wildlife well and demonstrably increasing wildlife populations. In South America, land-tenure
reform is promoted as a way to reduce deforestation.
6.6.4 Command and Control Regulations
Most environmental policy in the United States is much more rigid and controlling than property-rights reform. Our policies for things like clean air and water, toxic waste cleanup, and endangered species protection
have largely been composed of rigid rules and regulations. Under such policies, people are given strict and
specic rules about things they must or must not do regarding some facet of pollution control or natural
resource use, and then a government agency enforces the rules. Here we discuss and explore examples of a
few kinds of such "command-and-control" regulations.
6.6.4.1 Ambient Standard
Some policies have targets for the quality of some element of the environment that results from human
behavior and natural processes. An ambient standard establishes a level of environmental quality that
must be met. The Clean Air Act directs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs) for a range of air pollutants such as ozone and ne
particles. The Clean Water Act directs state oces of the EPA to set ambient water quality standards
for rivers and streams in their boundaries. In practice, however, such standards are binding only on state
regulators. State EPA oces are responsible for developing plans to ensure that air and surface water bodies
meet these ambient quality standards, but they cannot do the clean up on their own. They need to use a
dierent set of tools to induce private agents to actually reduce or clean up pollution such that the ambient
standards can be met.
Some ambient standards (such as the NAAQSs) have provoked criticism from economists for being uniform
across space. Every county in the country has to meet the same air quality goals, even though the ecient
levels of air quality might vary from one county to the next with variation in the marginal benets and
marginal costs of cleaning the air. However, uniform ambient standards grant all people in the U.S. the same
access to clean aira goal that has powerful appeal on the grounds of equity.
6.6.4.2 Individual Standards
First, we discuss a kind of policy applied to individual people or companies called a technology standard.
Pollution and resource degradation result from a combination of human activity and the characteristics of
the technology that humans employ in that activity. Behavior can be dicult to monitor and control. Hence,
lawmakers have often drafted rules to control our tools rather than our behaviors. For example, automakers
are required to install catalytic converters on new automobiles so that cars have lower pollution rates, and
people in some parts of the country must use low-ow showerheads and water-ecient toilets to try to reduce
water usage.
Technology standards have the great advantage of being easy to monitor and enforce; it is easy for a
regulator to check what pollution controls are in the design of a car. Under some circumstances technology
standards can reduce pollution and the rate of natural resource destruction, but they have several serious
limitations. First, they provide no incentives for people to alter elements of their behavior other than
technology choice. Cars may have to have catalytic converters to reduce emissions per mile, but people are
given no reason to reduce the number of miles they drive. Indeed, these policies can sometimes have perverse
eects on behavior. Early generations of water-ecient toilets performed very poorly; they used fewer gallons
of water per ush, but people found themselves ushing multiple times in order to get waste down the pipes.
Thus, these standards are neither always ecient nor cost eective. Second, technology standards are the
worst policy in the toolkit for promoting technological innovation. Firms are actively forbidden from using

263
any technology other than the one specied in the standards. Automakers might think of a better and
cheaper way to reduce air pollution from cars, but the standard says they have to use catalytic converters.
A second type of policy applied to individual agents is called a performance standard. Performance
standards set strict limits on an outcome of human activity. For example, in order to meet the NAAQSs,
state EPA oces set emission standards for air pollution sources in their states. Those standards limit the
amount of pollution a factory or power plant can release into the air, though each source can control its
pollution in any way it sees t. The limits on pollution are the same for all sources of a given type (e.g.,
power plant, cement factory, etc.). Performance standards are also used in natural resource regulation. For
example, because stormwater runo causes ooding and harms aquatic habitat, the city of Chicago requires
all new development to be designed handle the rst inch of rainfall in a storm onsite before runo begins.
To enforce a performance standard the regulator must be able to observe the outcome of the agents'
activities (e.g. measure the pollution, estimate the runo). If that is possible, these policies have some
advantages over technology standards. Performance standards do give people and rms some incentive to
innovate and nd cheaper ways to reduce pollution because they are free to use any technology they like to
meet the stated requirements. Performance standards are also more ecient because they give people and
rms incentives to change multiple things about their activity to reduce the total cost of pollution abatement;
a power plant can reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by some combination of installing scrubber technology,
switching to low-sulfur coal, and reducing total energy generation.
Performance standards also have some drawbacks and limitations, however. It is dicult for a regulator
to gure out the cost eective allocation of total pollution reduction between sources and then set dierent
performance standards for each source to reach that cost eective allocation. Hence, performance standards
tend to be uniform across individual pollution sources, and so pollution reduction is not done in the cheapest
way possible for the industry and society overall. This problem is particularly severe where there is great
variation among sources in their abatement costs, and thus the cost-eective allocation of cleanup among
sources is far from uniform.
6.6.5 Incentive Policies
Other approaches to environmental policy give rms and individuals incentives to change their behavior
rather than mandating specic changes. These incentive policies try to make use of market forces for what
they do bestallocating resources cost-eectively within an economywhile correcting the market failures
associated with externalities, public goods, and common pool resources.
6.6.5.1 Tax/Subsidy
Environmental taxes are based on a simple premise: if someone is not bearing the full social costs of their
actions, then we should charge them an externality tax per unit of harmful activity (e.g. ton of pollution,
gallon of stormwater runo) that is equal to the marginal cost that is not borne by the individual. In this
way, that person must internalize the externality, and will have the incentive to choose a level of activity
that is socially optimal. Thus, if we think the social marginal cost of ton of carbon dioxide (because of its
contribution to climate change) is $20, then we could charge a tax of $20 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted.
The easiest way to do this would be to have a tax on fossil fuels according to the amount of carbon dioxide
that will be emitted when they are burned.
If a price is placed on carbon dioxide, all agents would have an incentive to reduce their carbon dioxide
emissions to the point where the cost to them of reducing one more unit (their marginal abatement cost) is
equal to the per unit tax. Therefore, several good things happen. All carbon dioxide sources are abating
to the same marginal abatement cost, so the total abatement is accomplished in the most cost-eective way
possible. Furthermore, total emissions in the economy overall will go down to the socially ecient level.
Firms and individuals have very broad incentives to change things to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
reduce output and consumption, increase energy eciency, switch to low carbon fuelsand strong incentives
to gure out how to innovate so those changes are less costly. Finally, the government could use the revenue

264 CHAPTER 6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
it collects from the tax to correct any inequities in the distribution of the program's cost among people in
the economy or to reduce other taxes on things like income.
While taxes on externality-generating activities have many good features, they also have several drawbacks and limitations. First, while an externality tax can yield the ecient outcome (where costs and benets
are balanced for the economy as a whole), that only happens if policy makers know enough about the value
of the externality to set the tax at the right level. If the tax is too low, we will have too much of the harmful
activity; if the tax is too high, the activity will be excessively suppressed.
Second, even if we are able to design a perfect externality tax in theory, such a policy can be dicult to
enforce. The enforcement agency needs to be able to measure the total quantity of the thing being taxed. In
some cases that is easyin the case of carbon dioxide for example, the particular xed link between carbon
dioxide emissions and quantities of fossil fuels burned means that through the easy task of measuring fossil
fuel consumption we can measure the vast majority of carbon dioxide emissions. However, many externalitycausing activities or materials are dicult to measure in total. Nitrogen pollution ows into streams as a
result of fertilizer applications on suburban lawns, but it is impossible actually to measure the total ow of
nitrogen from a single lawn over the course of a year so that one could tax the homeowner for that ow.
Third, externality taxes face strong political opposition from companies and individuals who don't want
to pay the tax. Even if the government uses the tax revenues to do good things or to reduce other tax
rates, the group that disproportionately pays the tax has an incentive to lobby heavily against such a policy.
This phenomenon is at least partly responsible for the fact that there are no examples of pollution taxes
in the U.S. Instead, U.S. policy makers have implemented mirror-image subsidy policies, giving subsidies
for activities that reduce negative externalities rather than taxing activities that cause those externalities.
Environmental policy in the case of U.S. agriculture is a prime example of this, with programs that pay
farmers to take lands out of production or to adopt environmentally friendly farming practices. A subsidy
is equivalent to the mirror-image tax in most ways. However, a subsidy tends to make the relevant industry
more protable (in contrast to a tax, which reduces prots), which in turn can stimulate greater output and
have a slight perverse eect on total pollution or environmental degradation; degradation per unit output
might go down, but total output goes up.
6.6.5.2 Tradable Permits
Another major type of incentive policy is a tradable permits scheme. Tradable permits are actually very
similar to externality taxes, but they can have important dierences. These policies are colloquially known
as "cap and trade". If we know the ecient amount of the activity to have (e.g., number of tons of pollution,
amount of timber to be logged) the policy maker can set a cap on the total amount of the activity equal to
the ecient amount. Permits are created such that each permit grants the holder permission for one unit of
the activity. The government distributes these permits to the aected individuals or rms, and gives them
permission to sell (trade) them to one another. In order to be in compliance with the policy (and avoid
punishment, such as heavy nes) all agents must hold enough permits to cover their total activity for the
time period. The government doesn't set a price for the activity in question, but the permit market yields
a price for the permits that gives all the market participants strong incentives to reduce their externalitygenerating activities, to make cost-eective trades with other participants, and to innovate to nd cheaper
ways to be in compliance. Tradable permit policies are similar to externality taxes in terms of eciency,
cost-eectiveness, and incentives to innovate.
Tradable permit policies have been used in several environmental and natural resource policies. The U.S.
used tradable permits (where the annual cap declined to zero over a xed number of years) in two separate
policy applications to reduce the total cost to society of (a) phasing out the use of lead in gasoline and
(b) eliminating production of ozone-depleting chlorouorocarbons. The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990
put in place a nationwide tradable permit program for emissions of acid-rain precursor sulfur dioxide from
electric power plants. The European Union used a tradable permit market as part of its policy to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions under the Kyoto protocol. Individual tradable quotas for sh in sheries of Alaska
and New Zealand have been used to rationalize shing activity and keep total catches down to ecient and
sustainable levels (see Case Study: Marine Fisheries (Section 6.3)).

265
Tradable permits have been adopted more widely than externality taxes. Two factors may contribute to
that dierence. First, tradable permit policies can have dierent distributional eects from taxes depending
on how the permits are given out. If the government auctions the permits to participants in a competitive
marketplace, then the tradable permit scheme is the same as the tax; the industry pays the government
an amount equal to the number of permits multiplied by the permit price. However, policy makers more
commonly design policies where the permits are initially given for free to participants in the market, and
then participants sell the permits to each other. This eliminates the transfer of wealth from the regulated
sector (the electric utilities, the shing boats, etc.) to the government, a feature that has been popular with
industry. Second, taxes and tradable permits behave dierently in the face of uncertainty. A tax policy
xes the marginal cost to the industry, but might yield more or less of the harmful activity than expected
if market conditions uctuate. A cap and trade program xes the total amount of the harmful activity, but
can yield costs to industry that are wildly variable. Environmentalists have liked the outcome certainty of
tradable permits.
6.6.5.3 Liability
A third type of environmental policy was not designed by economists, but still functions to give agents
incentives to take ecient actions to reduce environmental degradation: liability. Liability provisions can
make people or rms pay for the damages caused by their actions. If the expected payment is equal to the
total externality cost, then liability makes the agent internalize the externality and take ecient precautions
to avoid harming the environment.
Two kinds of liability exist in the U.S.: statutory and common law. Common law derives from a long
tradition of legal history in the U.S.people have sued companies for damages from pollution under tort
law under doctrines such as nuisance, negligence, or trespass. This approach has been highly problematic
for a number of reasons. For example, tort law places a high burden of proof on the plainti to show that
damages resulted directly from actions taken by the defendant. Plaintis have often struggled with that
burden because pollution problems are often caused by many sources, and the harm caused by pollution can
display large lags in space and time. If the defendant expects with high probability not to be held responsible
by the courts, then liability does not function eectively to make agents internalize the externality costs of
their actions.
Frustration with common law has led to several strong statutory liability laws in the U.S. which make
explicit provisions for holding rms liable for damages from pollution with much more manageable burdens
of proof. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 holds companies like Exxon and British Petroleum strictly liable for
the damages caused by oil spills from accidents such as the Valdez grounding in Prince William Sound or
the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. Under a rule of strict liability, a party is liable for
harm if the harm occurred as a result of their actions regardless of the presence (or absence) of negligence
or intent. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or
"Superfund") holds companies strictly liable for damages from toxic waste "Superfund" sites.
These laws have surely increased the extent to which oil and chemical companies take precautions to
avoid spills and other releases of hazardous materials into the environment. However, enforcement of these
provisions is very costly. The legal proceedings for a big case like Deepwater Horizon entail court, lawyer,
and expert witness activity (and high fees) for many years. The transaction costs are so burdensome to
society that liability may not be a viable approach for all environmental problems.
6.6.6 Review questions
Question 6.6.1
What are some of the strengths and weaknesses of command and control regulation? When would

Modern Environmental Management
7.1 Modern Environmental Management  Chapter Introduction1
7.1.1 Introduction
In the Chapter The Evolution of Environmental Policy in the United States (Section 2.1), the ways
in which our current environmental policy evolved were presented and discussed. Although the National
Environmental Policy Act (Section 2.3.5: Risk Management as a Basis for Environmental Policy) (NEPA)
provided lofty goals for our environmental policy, and most importantly a legal basis for action, the fact
remains, then and today, that human actions produce very large quantities of waste, virtually all of it harmful
to human and ecosystem health if not managed properly. This chapter is about how we currently manage
these wastes (Module Systems of Waste Management (Section 7.2)), the laws and regulations that dene
our system of waste management (Module Government and Laws on the Environment (Section 7.4)),
and how we determine the consequences, i.e. risks, associated with chemicals released into the environment
(Module Risk Assessment Methodology for Conventional and Alternative Sustainability Options
(Section 7.5)). Of course, environmental policies will continue to evolve, and although we may not know the
exact pathway or form this will take, environmental policy of the future will most certainly build upon the
laws and regulations that are used today to manage human interactions with the environment. Thus, it is
important to develop an understanding of our current system, its legal and philosophical underpinnings, and
the quantitative basis for setting risk-based priorities.
An interesting example of how our current system of environmental management has adapted to modern,
and global, problems is the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, in April of 2007, in the case of Massachusetts vs. the
Environmental Protection Agency2
that the USEPA had misinterpreted the Clean Air Act in not classifying,
and regulating, carbon dioxide, as a pollutant (the plaintis actually involved twelve states and several cities).
Up until that time several administrations had said that the Act did not give the EPA legal authority to
regulate CO2 (and by inference all greenhouse gases). At the time the Clean Air Act (Section 7.4.4: Clean
Air Act) was passed (most recently in 1990), "clean air" was thought to mean both visibly clean air, and
also air free of pollutants exposure to which could cause harm to humans  harm being dened as an adverse
outcome over a course of time that might extend to a human lifetime. And although there was concern
about global climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions, the gases themselves were not thought of as
"pollutants" in the classical sense. This ruling set the stage for the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases through
a series of ndings, hearings, rulings, and regulations in accord with terms set out in the Clean Air Act.
This process is underway at the present time.
In addition to its signicance for potentially mitigating the problem of global climate change, this case
illustrates more generally how the environmental management system we have put in place today might

adapt to problems of the future. Laws that are forward-thinking, not overly proscriptive, and administratively
exible may well accommodate unforeseen problems and needs. Of course, this does not preclude the passage
of new laws or amendments, nor does it imply that all our laws on the environment will adapt in this way
to future problems.
7.2 Systems of Waste Management3
7.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• recognize various environmental regulations governing the management of solid and hazardous wastes,
radioactive waste and medical waste
• understand the environmental concerns with the growing quantities and improper management of
wastes being generated
• recognize integrated waste management strategies that consist of prevention, minimization, recycling and reuse, biological treatment, incineration, and landll disposal
7.2.2 Introduction
Waste is an inevitable by-product of human life. Virtually every human activity generates some type of
material side eect or by-product. When the materials that constitute these by-products are not useful or
have been degraded such that they no longer fulll their original or other obvious useful purpose, they are
classied as a waste material.
Practically speaking, wastes are generated from a wide range of sources and are usually classied by
their respective sources. Common generative activities include those associated with residences, commercial
businesses and enterprises, institutions, construction and demolition activities, municipal services, and water/wastewater and air treatment plants, and municipal incinerator facilities. Further, wastes are generated
from numerous industrial processes, including industrial construction and demolition, fabrication, manufacturing, reneries, chemical synthesis, and nuclear power/nuclear defense sources (often generating low- to
high-level radioactive wastes).
Population growth and urbanization (with increased industrial, commercial and institutional establishments) contribute to increased waste production, as do the rapid economic growth and industrialization
throughout the developing world. These social and economic changes have led to an ever-expanding consumption of raw materials, processed goods, and services. While these trends have, in many ways, improved
the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people, it has not come without drastic costs to the environment.
Proper management of a range of wastes has become necessary in order to protect public health and the
environment as well as ensure sustained economic growth.
It is commonly believed that incineration and landll disposal represent preferred options in dealing
with waste products; however, many wastes have the potential to be recycled or re-used for some purpose
or in some manner. Some waste materials may be reclaimed or re-generated and used again for their
original or similar purpose, or they may be physically or chemically changed and employed for alternative
uses. As natural resources continue to be depleted, and as incineration and landll disposal options become
more costly and unsustainable, numerous economic and social incentives are being promoted by government
agencies to prevent or reduce waste generation and develop new methods and technologies for recycling
and reusing wastes. Such eorts can have broader implications for energy conservation and the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change, while concurrently fostering sustainable
waste management practices.

This section provides an overview of the existing regulatory framework mandating the management of
wastes, environmental concerns associated with waste generation and management, and various alternatives for the proper management of wastes. Recent developments towards the development of sustainable
waste management systems are also highlighted. It should be mentioned here that although the content of
this section reects the regulatory framework and practices within the United States, similar developments
and actions have occurred in other developed countries and are increasingly being initiated in numerous
developing countries.
7.2.3 Regulatory Framework
During the course of the 20th century, especially following World War II, the United States experienced
unprecedented economic growth. Much of the growth was fueled by rapid and increasingly complex industrialization. With advances in manufacturing and chemical applications also came increases in the volume,
and in many cases the toxicity, of generated wastes. Furthermore, few if any controls or regulations were
in place with respect to the handling of toxic materials or the disposal of waste products. Continued industrial activity led to several high-prole examples of detrimental consequences to the environment resulting
from these uncontrolled activities. Finally, several forms of intervention, both in the form of government
regulation and citizen action, occurred in the early 1970s.
Ultimately, several regulations were promulgated on the state and federal levels to ensure the safety of
public health and the environment (see Module Government and Laws on the Environment (Section 7.4)). With respect to waste materials, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act4
(RCRA), enacted
by the United States Congress, rst in 1976 and then amended in 1984, provides a comprehensive framework
for the proper management of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes in the United States. RCRA
stipulates broad and general legal objectives while mandating the United States Environmental Protection
Agency5
(USEPA) to develop specic regulations to implement and enforce the law. The RCRA regulations are contained in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 239 to 299. States and
local governments can either adopt the federal regulations, or they may develop and enforce more stringent
regulations than those specied in RCRA. Similar regulations have been developed or are being developed
worldwide to manage wastes in a similar manner in other countries.
The broad goals of RCRA include: (1) the protection of public health and the environment from the
hazards of waste disposal; (2) the conservation of energy and natural resources; (3) the reduction or elimination of waste; and (4) the assurance that wastes are managed in an environmentally-sound manner (e.g.
the remediation of waste which may have spilled, leaked, or been improperly disposed). It should be noted
here that the RCRA focuses only on active and future facilities and does not address abandoned or historical
sites. These types of environmentally impacted sites are managed under a dierent regulatory framework,
known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act6
(CERCLA), or
more commonly known as "Superfund."
7.2.3.1 Solid Waste Regulations
RCRA denes solid waste as any garbage or refuse, sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility and other discarded material, including solid, liquid,
semi-solid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities. In general, solid waste can be categorized as either non-hazardous
waste or hazardous waste.
Non-hazardous solid waste can be trash or garbage generated from residential households, oces and
other sources. Generally, these materials are classied as municipal solid waste (MSW). Alternatively,
non-hazardous materials that result from the production of goods and products by various industries (e.g.
coal combustion residues, mining wastes, cement kiln dust), are collectively known as industrial solid waste.

270 CHAPTER 7. MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
The regulations pertaining to non-hazardous solid waste are contained in 40 CFR Parts 239 to 259 (known as
RCRA Subtitle D regulations7
).These regulations prohibit the open dumping of solid waste, mandates the
development of comprehensive plans to manage MSW and non-hazardous industrial waste, and establishes
criteria for MSW landlls and other solid waste disposal facilities. Because they are classied as nonhazardous material, many components of MSW and industrial waste have potential for recycling and re-use.
Signicant eorts are underway by both government agencies and industry to advance these objectives.
Hazardous waste, generated by many industries and businesses (e.g. dry cleaners and auto repair shops),
is constituted of materials that are dangerous or potentially harmful to human health and the environment.
The regulatory framework with respect to hazardous waste, specically hazardous waste identication, classication, generation, management, and disposal, is described in 40 CFR Parts 260 through 279 (collectively
known as RCRA Subtitle C regulations8
). These regulations control hazardous waste from the time they
are generated until their ultimate disposal (a timeline often referred to as "cradle to grave").
According to the RCRA Subtitle C regulations, solid waste is dened as hazardous if it appears in one
of the four hazardous waste classications:
• F-List (non-specic source wastes as specied in 40 CFR 261.31), which includes wastes from common
manufacturing and industrial processes, such as solvents used in cleaning and degreasing operations.
• K-list (source-specic waste as specied in 40 CFR 261.32), which includes certain wastes from specic
industries such as petroleum or pesticide manufacturing.
• P-list and U-list (discarded commercial chemical products as specied in 40 CFR 261.33), which include
commercial chemicals products in their unused form.
Additionally, a waste is classied as hazardous if it exhibits at least one of these four characteristics:
• Ignitability (as dened in 40 CFR 261.21), which refers to creation of res under certain conditions;
including materials that are spontaneously combustible or those that have a ash point less than 140
0F.
• Corrosivity (as dened in 40 CFR 261.22), which refers to capability to corrode metal containers;
including materials with a pH less than or equal to 2 or greater than or equal to 12.5.
• Reactivity (as dened in 40 CFR 261.23), which refers to materials susceptible to unstable conditions
such as explosions, toxic fumes, gases, or vapors when heated, compressed, or mixed with water under
normal conditions.
• Toxicity (as dened in 40 CFR 261.24), which refers to substances that can induce harmful or fatal
eects when ingested or absorbed, or inhaled.
7.2.3.2 Radioactive Waste Regulations
Although non-hazardous waste (MSW and industrial non-hazardous waste) and hazardous waste are regulated by RCRA, nuclear or radioactive waste is regulated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of
19549 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)10 in the United States.
Radioactive wastes are characterized according to four categories: (1) High-level waste (HLW), (2)
Transuranic waste (TRU), (3) Low-level waste (LLW), and (4) Mill tailings. Various radioactive
wastes decay at dierent rates, but health and environmental dangers due to radiation may persist for
hundreds or thousands of years.
HLW is typically liquid or solid waste that results from government defense related activities or from
nuclear power plants and spent fuel assemblies. These wastes are extremely dangerous due to their heavy
concentrations of radionuclides, and humans must not come into contact with them.

271
TRU mainly results from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels and from the fabrication of nuclear
weapons for defense projects. They are characterized by moderately penetrating radiation and a decay time of
approximately twenty years until safe radionuclide levels are achieved. Following the passage of a reprocessing
ban in 1977, most of this waste generation ended. Even though the ban was lifted in 1981, TRU continues
to be rare because reprocessing of nuclear fuel is expensive. Further, because the extracted plutonium may
be used to manufacture nuclear weapons, political and social pressures minimize these activities.
LLW wastes include much of the remainder of radioactive waste materials. They constitute over 80
percent of the volume of all nuclear wastes, but only about two percent of total radioactivity. Sources
of LLW include all of the previously cited sources of HLW and TRU, plus wastes generated by hospitals,
industrial plants, universities, and commercial laboratories. LLW is much less dangerous than HLW, and
NRC regulations allow some very low-level wastes to be released to the environment. LLW may also be
stored or buried until the isotopes decay to levels low enough such that it may be disposed of as nonhazardous waste. LLW disposal is managed at the state level, but requirements for operation and disposal
are established by the USEPA and NRC. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA)11 is
the agency in charge of setting the standards for workers that are exposed to radioactive materials.
Mill tailings generally consist of residues from the mining and extraction of uranium from its ore. There
are more than 200 million tons of radioactive mill-tailings in the United States, and all of it is stored in
sparsely populated areas within the western states, such as Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.
These wastes emit low-level radiation, and much of it is buried to reduce dangerous emissions.
7.2.3.3 Medical Waste Regulations
Another type of waste that is of environmental concern is medical waste. Medical waste is regulated
by several federal agencies, including the USEPA, OSHA, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC)12 of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR)13 of the Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services14
. During 1987-88, medical wastes and raw garbage washed up on beaches along the New Jersey Shore of
the United States on several occasions (called, "Syringe Tide15 ") which required closure of beaches. The
U.S. Congress subsequently enacted the Medical Waste Tracking Act (MWTA)16 to evaluate management
issues and potential risks related to medical waste disposal. The seven types of wastes listed under MWTA
include: (1) microbiological wastes (cultures and stocks of infectious wastes and associated biological media
that can cause disease in humans); (2) human blood and blood products, including serum, plasma, and other
blood components; (3) pathological wastes of human origin, including tissues, organs, and other body masses
removed during surgeries or autopsies); (4) contaminated animal wastes (i.e. animal carcasses, body masses,
and bedding exposed to infectious agents during medical research, pharmaceutical testing, or production of
biological media); (5) isolation wastes (wastes associated with animals or humans known to be infected with
highly communicable diseases); (6) contaminated sharps (including hypodermic needles, scalpels, and broken
glass); and (7) uncontaminated sharps. In addition, the USEPA considered including any other wastes that
had been in contact with infectious agents or blood (e.g. sponges, soiled dressings, drapes, surgical gloves,
laboratory coats, slides).
LLW nuclear wastes are produced in hospitals by pharmaceutical laboratories and in performing nuclear
medicine procedures (e.g. medical imaging to detect cancers and heart disease); however, the danger posed
by these wastes is relatively low. A variety of hazardous substances have also been identied in medical
wastes, including metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium, and mercury; and toxic organics such as dioxins
and furans. All medical wastes represent a small fraction of total waste stream, estimated to constitute a
maximum of approximately two percent. Medical wastes are commonly disposed of through incineration: as

with most wastes, the resulting volume is greatly reduced, and it assures the destruction and sterilization
of infectious pathogens. Disadvantages include the potential of air pollution risks from dioxins and furans
as well as the necessary disposal of potentially hazardous ash wastes. New options for disposal of medical
wastes (including infectious wastes) are still being explored. Some other technologies include irradiation,
microwaving, autoclaving, mechanical alternatives, and chemical disinfection, among others.
7.2.4 Environmental Concerns with Wastes
7.2.4.1 Managing Growing Waste Generation
An enormous quantity of wastes are generated and disposed of annually. Alarmingly, this quantity continues
to increase on an annual basis. Industries generate and dispose over 7.6 billion tons of industrial solid wastes
each year, and it is estimated that over 40 million tons of this waste is hazardous. Nuclear wastes as well as
medical wastes are also increasing in quantity every year.
Generally speaking, developed nations generate more waste than developing nations due to higher rates
of consumption. Not surprisingly, the United States generates more waste per capita than any other country.
High waste per capita rates are also very common throughout Europe and developed nations in Asia and
Oceania. In the United States, about 243 million tons (243 trillion kg) of MSW is generated per year, which
is equal to about 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg) of waste per person per day. Nearly 34 percent of MSW is recovered
and recycled or composted, approximately 12 percent is burned a combustion facilities, and the remaining
54 percent is disposed of in landlls. Waste stream percentages also vary widely by region. As an example,
San Francisco, California captures and recycles nearly 75 percent of its waste material, whereas Houston,
Texas recycles less than three percent.
With respect to waste mitigation options, landlling is quickly evolving into a less desirable or feasible
option. Landll capacity in the United States has been declining primarily due to (a) older existing landlls
that are increasingly reaching their authorized capacity, (b) the promulgation of stricter environmental
regulations has made the permitting and siting of new landlls increasingly dicult, (c) public opposition
(e.g. "Not In My Backyard" or NIMBYism17 ) delays or, in many cases, prevents the approval of new landlls
or expansion of existing facilities. Ironically, much of this public opposition arises from misconceptions about
landlling and waste disposal practices that are derived from environmentally detrimental historic activities
and practices that are no longer in existence. Regardless of the degree or extent of justication, NIMBYism
is a potent opposition phenomenon, whether it is associated with landlls or other land use activities, such
as airports, prisons, and wastewater treatment facilities.
7.2.4.2 Eects of Improper Waste Disposal and Unauthorized Releases
Prior to the passage of environmental regulations, wastes were disposed improperly without due consideration
of potential eects on the public health and the environment. This practice has led to numerous contaminated
sites where soils and groundwater have been contaminated and pose risk to the public safety. Of more than
36,000 environmentally impacted candidate sites, there are more than 1,400 sites listed under the Superfund
program National Priority List (NPL) which require immediate cleanup resulting from acute, imminent
threats to environmental and human health. The USEPA identied about 2,500 additional contaminated
sites that eventually require remediation. The United States Department of Defense maintains 19,000 sites,
many of which have been extensively contaminated from a variety of uses and disposal practices. Further,
approximately 400,000 underground storage tanks have been conrmed or are suspected to be leaking,
contaminating underlying soils and groundwater. Over $10 billion (more than $25 billion in current dollars)
were specically allocated by CERCLA and subsequent amendments to mitigate impacted sites. However,
the USEPA has estimated that the value of environmental remediation exceeds $100 billion. Alarmingly, if
past expenditures on NPL sites are extrapolated across remaining and proposed NPL sites, this total may
be signicantly higher  well into the trillions of dollars.
17http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY

273
It is estimated that more than 4,700 facilities in the United States currently treat, store or dispose of
hazardous wastes. Of these, about 3,700 facilities that house approximately 64,000 solid waste management
units (SWMUs) may require corrective action. Accidental spillage of hazardous wastes and nuclear materials due to anthropogenic operations or natural disasters has also caused enormous environmental damage
as evidenced by the events such as the facility failure in Chernobyl, Ukraine18 (formerly USSR) in 1986,
the eects of Hurricane Katrina19 that devastated New Orleans, Louisiana in 2005, and the 2011 T	ohoku
earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan20
.
7.2.4.3 Adverse Impacts on Public Health
A wide variety of chemicals are present within waste materials, many of which pose a signicant environmental
concern. Though the leachate generated from the wastes may contain toxic chemicals, the concentrations
and variety of toxic chemicals are quite small compared to hazardous waste sites. For example, explosives and
radioactive wastes are primarily located at Department of Energy (DOE) sites because many of these facilities
have been historically used for weapons research, fabrication, testing, and training. Organic contaminants are
largely found at oil reneries, or petroleum storage sites, and inorganic and pesticide contamination usually
is the result of a variety of industrial activities as well as agricultural activities. Yet, soil and groundwater
contamination are not the only direct adverse eects of improper waste management activities  recent
studies have also shown that greenhouse gas emissions from the wastes are signicant, exacerbating global
climate change.
A wide range of toxic chemicals, with an equally wide distribution of respective concentrations, is found
in waste streams. These compounds may be present in concentrations that alone may pose a threat to human
health or may have a synergistic/cumulative eect due to the presence of other compounds. Exposure to
hazardous wastes has been linked to many types of cancer, chronic illnesses, and abnormal reproductive
outcomes such as birth defects, low birth weights, and spontaneous abortions. Many studies have been
performed on major toxic chemicals found at hazardous waste sites incorporating epidemiological or animal
tests to determine their toxic eects.
As an example, the eects of radioactive materials are classied as somatic or genetic. The somatic
eects may be immediate or occur over a long period of time. Immediate eects from large radiation doses
often produce nausea and vomiting, and may be followed by severe blood changes, hemorrhage, infection,
and death. Delayed eects include leukemia, and many types of cancer including bone, lung, and breast
cancer. Genetic eects have been observed in which gene mutations or chromosome abnormalities result
in measurable harmful eects, such as decreases in life expectancy, increased susceptibility to sickness or
disease, infertility, or even death during embryonic stages of life. Because of these studies, occupational
dosage limits have been recommended by the National Council on Radiation Protection. Similar studies
have been completed for a wide range of potentially hazardous materials. These studies have, in turn,
been used to determine safe exposure levels for numerous exposure scenarios, including those that consider
occupational safety and remediation standards for a variety of land use scenarios, including residential,
commercial, and industrial land uses.
7.2.4.4 Adverse Impacts on the Environment
The chemicals found in wastes not only pose a threat to human health, but they also have profound eects
on entire eco-systems. Contaminants may change the chemistry of waters and destroy aquatic life and underwater eco-systems that are depended upon by more complex species. Contaminants may also enter the food
chain through plants or microbiological organisms, and higher, more evolved organisms bioaccumulate the
wastes through subsequent ingestion. As the contaminants move farther up the food chain, the continued
bioaccumulation results in increased contaminant mass and concentration. In many cases, toxic concentrations are reached, resulting in increased mortality of one or more species. As the populations of these

274 CHAPTER 7. MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
species decrease, the natural inter-species balance is aected. With decreased numbers of predators or food
sources, other species may be drastically aected, leading to a chain reaction that can aect a wide range
of ora and fauna within a specic eco-system. As the eco-system continues to deviate from equilibrium,
disastrous consequences may occur. Examples include the near extinction of the bald eagle due to persistent
ingestion of DDT-impacted sh, and the depletion of oysters, crabs, and sh in Chesapeake Bay due to
excessive quantities of fertilizers, toxic chemicals, farm manure wastes, and power plant emissions.
7.2.5 Waste Management Strategies
The long-recognized hierarchy of management of wastes, in order of preference consists of prevention, minimization, recycling and reuse, biological treatment, incineration, and landll disposal (see Figure Hierarchy of Waste Management (Figure 7.1)).
Figure 7.1: Hierarchy of Waste Management Figure shows the hierarchy of management of wastes
in order or preference, starting with prevention as the most favorable to disposal as the least favorable
option. Source: Drstuey via Wikimedia Commons21
7.2.5.1 Waste Prevention
The ideal waste management alternative is to prevent waste generation in the rst place. Hence, waste
prevention is a basic goal of all the waste management strategies. Numerous technologies can be employed
throughout the manufacturing, use, or post-use portions of product life cycles to eliminate waste and,
in turn, reduce or prevent pollution. Some representative strategies include environmentally conscious
manufacturing methods that incorporate less hazardous or harmful materials, the use of modern leakage
detection systems for material storage, innovative chemical neutralization techniques to reduce reactivity, or
water saving technologies that reduce the need for fresh water inputs.

275
7.2.5.2 Waste Minimization
In many cases, wastes cannot be outright eliminated from a variety of processes. However, numerous strategies can be implemented to reduce or minimize waste generation. Waste minimization, or source reduction,
refers to the collective strategies of design and fabrication of products or services that minimize the amount
of generated waste and/or reduce the toxicity of the resultant waste. Often these eorts come about from
identied trends or specic products that may be causing problems in the waste stream and the subsequent
steps taken to halt these problems. In industry, waste can be reduced by reusing materials, using less
hazardous substitute materials, or by modifying components of design and processing. Many benets can
be realized by waste minimization or source reduction, including reduced use of natural resources and the
reduction of toxicity of wastes.
Waste minimization strategies are extremely common in manufacturing applications; the savings of material use preserves resources but also saves signicant manufacturing related costs. Advancements in streamlined packaging reduces material use, increased distribution eciency reduces fuel consumption and resulting
air emissions. Further, engineered building materials can often be designed with specic favorable properties that, when accounted for in overall structural design, can greatly reduce the overall mass and weight
of material needed for a given structure. This reduces the need for excess material and reduces the waste
associated with component fabrication.
The dry cleaning industry provides an excellent example of product substitution to reduce toxic waste
generation. For decades, dry cleaners used tetrachloroethylene, or "perc" as a dry cleaning solvent. Although
eective, tetrachloroethylene is a relatively toxic compound. Additionally, it is easily introduced into the
environment, where it is highly recalcitrant due to its physical properties. Further, when its degradation
occurs, the intermediate daughter products generated are more toxic to human health and the environment.
Because of its toxicity and impact on the environment, the dry cleaning industry has adopted new
practices and increasingly utilizes less toxic replacement products, including petroleum-based compounds.
Further, new emerging technologies are incorporating carbon dioxide and other relatively harmless compounds. While these substitute products have in many cases been mandated by government regulation, they
have also been adopted in response to consumer demands and other market-based forces.
7.2.5.3 Recycling and Reuse
Recycling refers to recovery of useful materials such as glass, paper, plastics, wood, and metals from the
waste stream so they may be incorporated into the fabrication of new products. With greater incorporation
of recycled materials, the required use of raw materials for identical applications is reduced. Recycling
reduces the need of natural resource exploitation for raw materials, but it also allows waste materials to be
recovered and utilized as valuable resource materials. Recycling of wastes directly conserves natural resources,
reduces energy consumption and emissions generated by extraction of virgin materials and their subsequent
manufacture into nished products, reduces overall energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions that
contribute to the global climate change, and reduces the incineration or landlling of the materials that have
been recycled. Moreover, recycling creates several economic benets, including the potential to create job
markets and drive growth.
Common recycled materials include paper, plastics, glass, aluminum, steel, and wood. Additionally,
many construction materials can be reused, including concrete, asphalt materials, masonry, and reinforcing
steel. "Green" plant-based wastes are often recovered and immediately reused for mulch or fertilizer applications. Many industries also recover various by-products and/or rene and "re-generate" solvents for reuse.
Examples include copper and nickel recovery from metal nishing processes; the recovery of oils, fats, and
plasticizers by solvent extraction from lter media such as activated carbon and clays; and acid recovery by
spray roasting, ion exchange, or crystallization. Further, a range of used food-based oils are being recovered
and utilized in "biodiesel" applications.
Numerous examples of successful recycling and reuse eorts are encountered every day. In some cases,
the recycled materials are used as input materials and are heavily processed into end products. Common
examples include the use of scrap paper for new paper manufacturing, or the processing of old aluminum

276 CHAPTER 7. MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
cans into new aluminum products. In other cases, reclaimed materials undergo little or no processing
prior to their re-use. Some common examples include the use of tree waste as wood chips, or the use of
brick and other xtures into new structural construction. In any case, the success of recycling depends on
eective collection and processing of recyclables, markets for reuse (e.g. manufacturing and/or applications
that utilize recycled materials), and public acceptance and promotion of recycled products and applications
utilizing recycled materials.
7.2.5.4 Biological Treatment
Landll disposal of wastes containing signicant organic fractions is increasingly discouraged in many countries, including the United States. Such disposal practices are even prohibited in several European countries.
Since landlling does not provide an attractive management option, other techniques have been identied.
One option is to treat waste so that biodegradable materials are degraded and the remaining inorganic waste
fraction (known as residuals) can be subsequently disposed or used for a benecial purpose.
Biodegradation of wastes can be accomplished by using aerobic composting, anaerobicdigestion, or
mechanical biological treatment (MBT) methods. If the organic fraction can be separated from inorganic
material, aerobic composting or anaerobic digestion can be used to degrade the waste and convert it into
usable compost. For example, organic wastes such as food waste, yard waste, and animal manure that
consist of naturally degrading bacteria can be converted under controlled conditions into compost, which
can then be utilized as natural fertilizer. Aerobic composting is accomplished by placing selected proportions
of organic waste into piles, rows or vessels, either in open conditions or within closed buildings tted with gas
collection and treatment systems. During the process, bulking agents such as wood chips are added to the
waste material to enhance the aerobic degradation of organic materials. Finally, the material is allowed to
stabilize and mature during a curing process where pathogens are concurrently destroyed. The end-products
of the composting process include carbon dioxide, water, and the usable compost material.
Compost material may be used in a variety of applications. In addition to its use as a soil amendment
for plant cultivation, compost can be used remediate soils, groundwater, and stormwater. Composting can
be labor-intensive, and the quality of the compost is heavily dependent on proper control of the composting
process. Inadequate control of the operating conditions can result in compost that is unsuitable for benecial
applications. Nevertheless, composting is becoming increasingly popular; composting diverted 82 million
tons of waste material away the landll waste stream in 2009, increased from 15 million tons in 1980. This
diversion also prevented the release of approximately 178 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2009  an
amount equivalent to the yearly carbon dioxide emissions of 33 million automobiles.
In some cases, aerobic processes are not feasible. As an alternative, anaerobic processes may be utilized.
Anaerobic digestion consists of degrading mixed or sorted organic wastes in vessels under anaerobic conditions. The anaerobic degradation process produces a combination of methane and carbon dioxide (biogas)
and residuals (biosolids). Biogas can be used for heating and electricity production, while residuals can be
used as fertilizers and soil amendments. Anaerobic digestion is a preferred degradation for wet wastes as
compared to the preference of composting for dry wastes. The advantage of anaerobic digestion is biogas
collection; this collection and subsequent benecial utilization makes it a preferred alternative to landll disposal of wastes. Also, waste is degraded faster through anaerobic digestion as compared to landll disposal.
Another waste treatment alternative, mechanical biological treatment (MBT), is not common in the
United States. However, this alternative is widely used in Europe. During implementation of this method,
waste material is subjected to a combination of mechanical and biological operations that reduce volume
through the degradation of organic fractions in the waste. Mechanical operations such as sorting, shredding,
and crushing prepare the waste for subsequent biological treatment, consisting of either aerobic composting
or anaerobic digestion. Following the biological processes, the reduced waste mass may be subjected to
incineration.

277
7.2.5.5 Incineration
Waste degradation not only produces useful solid end-products (such as compost), degradation by-products
can also be used as a benecial energy source. As discussed above, anaerobic digestion of waste can generate
biogas, which can be captured and incorporated into electricity generation. Alternatively, waste can be
directly incinerated to produce energy. Incineration consists of waste combustion at very high temperatures
to produce electrical energy. The byproduct of incineration is ash, which requires proper characterization
prior to disposal, or in some cases, benecial re-use. While public perception of incineration can be negative,
this is often based reactions to older, less ecient technologies. New incinerators are cleaner, more exible
and ecient, and are an excellent means to convert waste to energy while reducing the volume of waste.
Incineration can also oset fossil fuel use and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Bogner et al., 2007
(p. 278)). It is widely used in developed countries due to landll space limitations. It is estimated that
about 130 million tons of waste are annually combusted in more than 600 plants in 35 countries. Further,
incineration is often used to eectively mitigate hazardous wastes such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, oils,
solvents, medical wastes, and pesticides.
Despite all these advantages, incineration is often viewed negatively because of the resulting air emissions,
the creation of daughter chemical compounds, and production of ash, which is commonly toxic. Currently,
many 'next generation" systems are being researched and developed, and the USEPA is developing new
regulations to carefully monitor incinerator air emissions under the Clean Air Act22
.
7.2.5.6 Landll Disposal
Despite advances in reuse and recycling, landll disposal remains the primary waste disposal method in
the United States. As previously mentioned, the rate of MSW generation continues to increase, but overall
landll capacity is decreasing. New regulations concerning proper waste disposal and the use of innovative
liner systems to minimize the potential of groundwater contamination from leachate inltration and migration have resulted in a substantial increase in the costs of landll disposal. Also, public opposition to
landlls continues to grow, partially inspired by memories of historic uncontrolled dumping practices the
resulting undesirable side eects of uncontrolled vectors, contaminated groundwater, unmitigated odors, and
subsequent diminished property values.
Landlls can be designed and permitted to accept hazardous wastes in accordance with RCRA Subtitle
C regulations, or they may be designed and permitted to accept municipal solid waste in accordance with
RCRA Subtitle D regulations. Regardless of their waste designation, landlls are engineered structures
consisting of bottom and side liner systems, leachate collection and removal systems, nal cover systems,
gas collection and removal systems, and groundwater monitoring systems (Sharma and Reddy, 2004 (p.
278)). An extensive permitting process is required for siting, designing and operating landlls. Post-closure
monitoring of landlls is also typically required for at least 30 years. Because of their design, wastes within
landlls are degraded anaerobically. During degradation, biogas is produced and collected. The collection
systems prevent uncontrolled subsurface gas migration and reduce the potential for an explosive condition.
The captured gas is often used in cogeneration facilities for heating or electricity generation. Further, upon
closure, many landlls undergo "land recycling" and redeveloped as golf courses, recreational parks, and
other benecial uses.
Wastes commonly exist in a dry condition within landlls, and as a result, the rate of waste degradation
is commonly very slow. These slow degradation rates are coupled with slow rates of degradation-induced
settlement, which can in turn complicate or reduce the potential for benecial land re-use at the surface.
Recently, the concept of bioreactor landlls has emerged, which involves recirculation of leachate and/or
injection of selected liquids to increase the moisture in the waste, which in turn induces rapid degradation.
The increased rates of degradation increase the rate of biogas production, which increases the potential of
benecial energy production from biogas capture and utilization.

278 CHAPTER 7. MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
7.2.6 Summary
Many wastes, such as high-level radioactive wastes, will remain dangerous for thousands of years, and even
MSW can produce dangerous leachate that could devastate an entire eco-system if allowed inltrate into
and migrate within groundwater. In order to protect human health and the environment, environmental
professionals must deal with problems associated with increased generation of waste materials. The solution
must focus on both reducing the sources of wastes as well as the safe disposal of wastes. It is, therefore,
extremely important to know the sources, classications, chemical compositions, and physical characteristics
of wastes, and to understand the strategies for managing them.
Waste management practices vary not only from country to country, but they also vary based on the
type and composition of waste. Regardless of the geographical setting of the type of waste that needs
to be managed, the governing principle in the development of any waste management plan is resource
conservation. Natural resource and energy conservation is achieved by managing materials more eciently.
Reduction, reuse, and recycling are primary strategies for eective reduction of waste quantities. Further,
proper waste management decisions have increasing importance, as the consequences of these decisions have
broader implications with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change. As a result, several
public and private partnership programs are under development with the goal of waste reduction through the
adoption of new and innovative waste management technologies. Because waste is an inevitable by-product
of civilization, the successful implementation of these initiatives will have a direct eect on the enhanced
quality of life for societies worldwide.

7.3 Case Study: Electronic Waste and Extended Producer
Responsibility24
Electronic waste, commonly known as e-waste, refers to discarded electronic products such as televisions,
computers and computer peripherals (e.g. monitors, keyboards, disk drives, and printers), telephones and
cellular phones, audio and video equipment, video cameras, fax and copy machines, video game consoles,
and others (see Figure Electronic Waste (Figure 7.2)).
Figure 7.2: Electronic Waste Photograph shows many computers piled up in a parking lot as waste.

In the United States, it is estimated that about 3 million tons of e-waste are generated each year. This
waste quantity includes approximately 27 million units of televisions, 205 million units of computer products,
and 140 million units of cell phones. Less than 15 to 20 percent of the e-waste is recycled or refurbished;
the remaining percentage is commonly disposed of in landlls and/or incinerated. It should be noted that
e-waste constitutes less than 4 percent of total solid waste generated in the United States. However, with
tremendous growth in technological advancements in the electronics industry, many electronic products are
becoming obsolete quickly, thus increasing the production of e-waste at a very rapid rate. The quantities of
e-waste generated are also increasing rapidly in other countries such as India and China due to high demand
for computers and cell phones.

280 CHAPTER 7. MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
In addition to the growing quantity of e-waste, the hazardous content of e-waste is a major environmental
concern and poses risks to the environment if these wastes are improperly managed once they have reached
the end of their useful life. Many e-waste components consist of toxic substances, including heavy metals
such as lead, copper, zinc, cadmium, and mercury as well as organic contaminants, such as ame retardants
(polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenylethers). The release of these substances into the
environment and subsequent human exposure can lead to serious health and pollution issues. Concerns have
also been raised with regards to the release of toxic constituents of e-waste into the environment if landlling
and/or incineration options are used to manage the e-waste.
Various regulatory and voluntary programs have been instituted to promote reuse, recycling and safe
disposal of bulk e-waste. Reuse and refurbishing has been promoted to reduce raw material use energy
consumption, and water consumption associated with the manufacture of new products. Recycling and
recovery of elements such as lead, copper, gold, silver and platinum can yield valuable resources which
otherwise may cause pollution if improperly released into the environment. The recycling and recovery
operations have to be conducted with extreme care, as the exposure of e-waste components can result in
adverse health impacts to the workers performing these operations. For economic reasons, recycled e-waste
is often exported to other countries for recovery operations. However, lax regulatory environments in many
of these countries can lead to unsafe practices or improper disposal of bulk residual e-waste, which in turn
can adversely aect vulnerable populations.
In the United States, there are no specic federal laws dealing with e-waste, but many states have recently
developed e-waste regulations that promote environmentally sound management. For example, the State of
California passed the Electronic Waste Recycling Act26 in 2003 to foster recycling, reuse, and environmentally
sound disposal of residual bulk e-waste. Yet, in spite of recent regulations and advances in reuse, recycling
and proper disposal practices, additional sustainable strategies to manage e-waste are urgently needed.
One sustainable strategy used to manage e-waste is extended producer responsibility (EPR), also known
as product stewardship. This concept holds manufacturers liable for the entire life-cycle costs associated with the electronic products, including disposal costs, and encourages the use of environmentalfriendly manufacturing processes and products. Manufacturers can pursue EPR in multiple ways, including
reuse/refurbishing, buy-back, recycling, and energy production or benecial reuse applications. Life-cycle
assessment and life-cycle cost methodologies may be used to compare the environmental impacts of these
dierent waste management options. Incentives or nancial support is also provided by some government
and/or regulatory agencies to promote EPR. The use of non-toxic and easily recyclable materials in product
fabrication is a major component of any EPR strategy. A growing number of companies (e.g. Dell, Sony,
HP) are embracing EPR with various initiatives towards achieving sustainable e-waste management.
EPR is a preferred strategy because the manufacturer bears a nancial and legal responsibility for their
products; hence, they have an incentive to incorporate green design and manufacturing practices that incorporate easily recyclable and less toxic material components while producing electronics with longer product
lives. One obvious disadvantage of EPR is the higher manufacturing cost, which leads to increased cost of
electronics to consumers.
There is no specic federal law requiring EPR for electronics, but the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) undertook several initiatives to promote EPR to achieve the following goals: (1)
foster environmentally conscious design and manufacturing, (2) increase purchasing and use of more environmentally sustainable electronics, and (3) increase safe, environmentally sound reuse and recycling of used
electronics. To achieve these goals, USEPA has been engaged in various activities, including the promotion
of environmental considerations in product design, the development of evaluation tools for environmental
attributes of electronic products, the encouragement of recycling (or e-cycling), and the support of programs
to reduce e-waste, among others. More than 20 states in the United States and various organizations worldwide have already developed laws and/or policies requiring EPR in some form when dealing with electronic
products. For instance, the New York State Wireless Recycling Act27 emphasizes that authorized retailers
and service providers should be compelled to participate in take-back programs, thus allowing increased

281
recycling and reuse of e-waste. Similarly, Maine is the rst U.S. state to adopt a household e-waste law with
EPR.
In Illinois, Electronic Products Recycling & Reuse Act28 requires the electronic manufacturers to participate in the management of discarded and unwanted electronic products from residences. The Illinois EPA has
also compiled e-waste collection site locations29 where the residents can give away their discarded electronic
products at no charge. Furthermore, USEPA compiled a list of local programs and manufacturers/retailers30
that can help consumers to properly donate or recycle e-waste.
Overall, the growing quantities and environmental hazards associated with electronic waste are of major
concern to waste management professionals worldwide. Current management strategies, including recycling
and refurbishing, have not been successful. As a result, EPR regulations are rapidly evolving throughout
the world to promote sustainable management of e-waste. However, neither a consistent framework nor
assessment tools to evaluate EPR have been fully developed.
7.4 Government and Laws on the Environment31
7.4.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this section, students should be able to
• understand the purpose of government regulations set for the protection of human health and the
environment
• distinguish the current environmental laws and regulations for various types of pollutants present in
dierent media or phases of the environment
• discern the need for future environmental laws as related to the sustainability of industrial activity and
the economy
7.4.2 Introduction
In the United States, the laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment have been
enacted by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is authorized to enforce
the environmental laws and to implement the environmental regulations. The United States environmental
laws cover various phases of the environment such as water, air, and hazardous waste, where most of the
regulations have been based on the risk assessment of the pollutants. The major environmental laws and
regulations are briey listed in the Table Summary of Major Environmental Laws (Table 7.1).

7.4.3 Water
7.4.3.1 Clean Water Act
To protect the surface waters of the United States such as lakes, rivers, streams, shorelines and estuaries,
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act was established in 1956. The amendment to the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) of 1972 focused on surface water quality goals, euent limits based on
available technology, and a national discharge permit system. The FWPCA (1972) introduced euent limits
for chemical substances in surface waters in conjunction with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) allowing for enforceable control over permits obtained by industry for discharge of euents
containing pollutants into natural water systems. The Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1977 placed emphasis on
the control of waterborne toxic substances released into natural surface waters. The CWA introduced a Priority List of Pollutants which includes 127 toxic chemical substances including synthetic organic compounds
and heavy metals. In accordance with the CWA, the EPA must establish euent limitations for chemical
substances on the List of Priority Pollutants for discharge by industrial facilities and municipal wastewater
treatment plants.
The CWA aims to provide a system of national euent standards for each industry, a set of water quality
standards, an enforceable discharge permit program, provisions for special wastes such as toxic chemicals

283
and oil spills, and a construction program for publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). Municipal wastewater treatment plants are examples of POTWs. The NPDES permits are issued according to the euent
limitations required by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Clean Water Act. Because of higher
costs associated with treatment of industrial euents before discharge into natural waters which requires
an NPDES permit, many industries discharge to a municipal sewer and have their wastes treated at the
POTW following pretreatment regulations overseen by the POTW. In addition, the CWA provides permits
for stormwater and other non-point source (see denition in Module "Sustainable Stormwater Management")
pollution to prevent stormwater runo over contaminated land and paved areas from polluting surface waters
such as rivers and lakes. Stormwater pollution prevention plans and stormwater treatment facilities have to
be implemented to avoid contamination of clean water.
7.4.3.2 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)
The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 was established to prevent potential contamination of groundwater, which may serve as a source of drinking water. The SDWA amendments of 1986 and 1996 established
standards for water quality, which apply to drinking water as supplied by the public water supply systems.
The groundwater standards are also used to determine groundwater protection regulations under a number
of other statutes. The EPA has established a set of standards for unhealthful contaminants in drinking water referred to as the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs) as required by the SDWA
amendment of 1986. The list of regulated contaminants includes synthetic organic compounds, inorganic
species such as heavy metals, radionuclides, and pathogenic microorganisms. The NPDWR standards include
both enforceable Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) and nonenforceable Maximum Contaminant Level
Goals (MCLGs) used as health goals. The MCLs are achieved in the drinking water treatment plant using
the Best Available Technology (BAT) for removal of the contaminants from water. Many of the drinking
water MCLGs have also become the working standards for organic and inorganic chemical contaminants as
"Superfund" regulations for hazardous waste site cleanups; Superfund regulations deal with the cleanup of
abandoned sites containing hazardous wastes. Table Example Drinking Water Standards (Table 7.2)
lists the MCLs and MCLGs for several chemical contaminants. The Safe Drinking Water Act amendment
of 1986 also introduced Secondary Maximum Contaminant Levels (SMCLs) that act as recommended maximum levels for contaminants, which do not have an adverse health eect but are mostly related to esthetics
of water (such as color and odor). The use of sound science and risk-based standard setting for the NPDWRs
is included in the SDWA amendment of 1996; new contaminants may be added in the future using a list of
candidate contaminants. In addition, the SDWA amendment of 1996 provides guidance to individual states
and industry toward protection of source water and well-head areas used for public water supply.

7.4.4 Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1955 and subsequent amendments were established to improve the quality of the
air resources in the United States. The CAA amendments of 1990 have provisions for maintenance of ambient
air quality to promote and improve public health. Enforcement of regulations is carried out through the use
of emission standards on stationary and mobile sources of air pollution that are directed at decreasing the
production of air contaminants from various sources. A National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)
is the maximum permissible concentration of a contaminant in ambient air. Seven classes of air pollutants
for which the NAAQS has been established are referred to as criteria pollutants: lead, nitrogen oxides, sulfur
oxides, ozone, particulate matter smaller than 10 µm (PM10), hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Some
pollutants have short-term and long-term standards designed to protect against acute and chronic health
eects, respectively. In addition to criteria pollutants, Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) are those pollutants
that are known or suspect carcinogens, or may lead to other serious health eects over a longer period of
exposure. The main sources of HAPs are industrial and automotive emissions. The CAA amendments of
1990 have provisions for the reduction in emission of HAPs that lead to lower concentrations of HAPs in
ambient air.
The CAA amendments of 1990 established a permit program for larger sources of air emissions, where
permits are issued by states or by the EPA. Information on the types of pollutants that are emitted, the
emission levels, the monitoring of the emissions, and the plans to decrease the emissions is included in the
permit. All applicable information on the emissions and legal responsibilities of the business are conveyed
by the permit system. The 1990 CAA amendments provide several market-based approaches to businesses
to reach their pollution cleanup thresholds such as pollution allowances that can be traded. In addition,
economic incentives are provided to businesses to trade the extra credit for operations requiring less cleanup
in exchange with the lesser credit given for operations requiring more cleanup.
The CAA aims to reduce emissions from mobile sources such as cars and other vehicles, and to develop
cleaner fuels. To maintain higher octane ranking in unleaded gasoline, the reners have used more volatile

fractions in unleaded gasoline formulas, leading to release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Under the
CAA amendments of 1990, gasoline fuels are required to contain less volatile fractions, to contain oxyfuel
compounds (such as alcohol-based oxygenated compounds) for reduced production of carbon monoxide in
cold weather, to contain detergents for smoother running of engines, and to contain less sulfur in diesel fuel.
The production of cars capable of burning cleaner fuels such as natural gas or alcohol is mandated by the
CAA amendments of 1990.
Emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from combustion processes contribute to the
formation of acid rain. Most of the sulfur dioxide emitted annually in the United States is produced from the
burning of high-sulfur coal by electric utilities, resulting in acid rain with adverse impacts on the environment
and public health. Reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions is mandated by the CAA. Pollution allowances (up
to prescribed thresholds by EPA) for sulfur dioxide have been established by the EPA for each utility, where
allowances may be traded between utilities or within a company. Companies with emissions less than the
EPA allowance may trade their excess allowance with companies with allowance decits, preventing severe
hardships to those utilities that that are dependent on high-sulfur coal. The CAA has also set provisions
for reduction of NOx emissions. A market-based approach is employed by the 1990 CAA amendments to
eliminate ozone-destroying chemical substances (such as chlorouorocarbons) that deplete the ozone layer
using a phasing-out schedule by terminating the production of these chemicals in accordance with the
Montreal Protocol (1989). The recycling of chlorouorocarbons (CFCs) and the labeling of ozone-friendly
substitute chemicals are mandated by the CAA.
7.4.5 Hazardous Wastes
Hazardous wastes are wastes that pose a health and safety risk to humans and to the environment. The
EPA designates hazardous wastes as wastes which contain components that have one of the four general
characteristics of reactivity, corrosivity, ignitability and toxicity, in addition to other EPA classications of
hazardous wastes. The laws and regulations governing the management of hazardous wastes and materials
may be divided into two categories: present and future hazardous materials and wastes are regulated under
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), while past and usually abandoned hazardous waste
sites are managed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA).
7.4.5.1 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
The RCRA (1976) aims to achieve environmentally sound management of both hazardous and nonhazardous
wastes. As required by RCRA, the EPA established a cradle-to-grave (see Module Life Cycle Assessment
(Section 9.2)) hazardous material management system in an attempt to track hazardous material or waste
from its point of generation to its ultimate point of disposal, where the generators of hazardous materials have
to attach a "manifest" form to their hazardous materials shipments. The management of hazardous wastes
including the transport, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes is regulated under the RCRA.
For hazardous wastes disposal, this procedure will result in the shipment and arrival of those wastes at a
permitted disposal site. The RCRA also promotes the concept of resource recovery to decrease the generation
of waste materials. The RCRA, as amended, contains 10 subtitles. Subtitle C, for example, authorizes
regulations for management of hazardous wastes and Subtitle I deals with regulation of Underground Storage
Tanks (USTs).
Hazardous waste management facilities receiving hazardous wastes for treatment, storage or disposal are
referred to as treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs). The EPA closely regulates the TSDFs so
that they operate properly for protection of human health and the environment. TSDFs may be owned
and operated by independent companies that receive wastes from a number of waste generators, or by the
generators of waste themselves. TSDFs include landlls, incinerators, impoundments, holding tanks, and
many other treatment units designed for safe and ecient management of hazardous waste. The EPA closely
regulates the construction and operation of these TSDFs, where the operators of TSDFs must obtain a permit
from the EPA delineating the procedures for the operation of these facilities. The operators must also provide

insurance and adequate nancial backing. The shipping of wastes to a TSDF or recycler is frequently less
expensive than obtaining and meeting all the requirements for a storage permit.
The major amendment to Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was instituted in 1984 as the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA). The HSWA provides regulation for leaking underground
storage tanks (leaking USTs) aecting groundwater pollution. The RCRA regulates USTs containing hazardous wastes. The HSWA added Subtitle I to RCRA to provide for regulation of new and existing UST
systems, including corrosion protection for all USTs to prevent the leaking of hazardous waste from corroded
USTs. As part of the Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act (SARA, 1986), Subtitle I to RCRA was
modied to provide for remedies and compensation due to petroleum releases from UST systems. In addition,
the HSWA provides for regulation to prevent the contamination of groundwater by hazardous wastes, where
the EPA restricts the disposal of hazardous wastes in landlls due to the migration of hazardous constituents
from the waste placed in landlls.
7.4.5.2 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Composition, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
The CERCLA (1980) also known as 'Superfund" aims to provide for liability, compensation and the cleanup
of inactive or abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites, and for emergency response to releases of hazardous
materials into the environment. CERCLA gives the EPA the power and the funding to clean up abandoned
hazardous waste sites and to respond to emergencies related to hazardous waste releases. The Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 solidied many of the provisions of CERCLA such as
increasing the authority of the EPA to respond to remediation of hazardous waste sites with a faster startup
for cleanup of contaminated sites, and greatly increased the available trust fund for cleanup.
The EPA uses the National Priority List (NPL) to identify contaminated sites that present a risk to public
health or the environment and that may be eligible for Superfund money. A numeric ranking system known
as the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) has been established to determine the eligibility of contaminated sites
for Superfund money, where sites with high HRS scores are most likely to be added to the NPL. The National
Contingency Plan (NCP) provides guidance for the initial assessment and the HRS ranking of contaminated
sites. After the initial assessment of a contaminated site, a remedial investigation is carried out where the
NCP provides for a detailed evaluation of the risks associated with that site. A remedial investigation results
in a work plan, which leads to the selection of an appropriate remedy referred to as a feasibility study. The
feasibility study assesses several remedial alternatives, resulting in Record of Decision (ROD) as the basis
for the design of the selected alternative. The degree of cleanup is specied by the NCP in accordance with
several criteria such as the degree of hazard to the public health and the environment, where the degree of
cleanup varies for dierent contaminated sites.
A separate addition to the provisions of CERCLA is Title III of SARA known as the Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). The State Emergency Response Commission must be noti-
ed by a regulated facility that has extremely hazardous substances exceeding the EPA specied Threshold
Planning Quantities. The community is responsible for establishing Local Emergency Planning Committees
to develop a chemical emergency response plan which provides information on the regulated facilities, emergency response procedures, training and evacuation plans. The awareness of a community about the specic
chemicals present in the community is an integral part of the Community's Right-to-Know, in addition to
public information about potential hazards from those chemicals. The EPCRA also stipulates that each
year those facilities that release chemicals above specied threshold levels should submit a Toxics Release
Inventory (TRI) according to EPA specications. The TRI includes information on both accidental and
routine releases in addition to o-site transfers of waste. The availability of the TRI data to the public has
led to serious consideration by industry to control their previously unregulated and uncontrolled emissions
due to the heightened public concern about the presence and the releases of chemicals in their community.

7.4.6 Oil Pollution Act
The Oil Pollution Act (1990), or OPA, was established in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill incident33
.
The Exxon Valdez oil spill (see Figure Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (Figure 7.3)), which occurred in Alaska in
1989, was the largest ever oil spill in the United States, causing major environmental and economic damage
in Alaska.
Figure 7.3: Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Heavy sheens of oil covering large areas of the Prince William
Sound, Alaska a few days after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Source: U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration via Wikimedia Commons34
The prevention of oil spills in navigable waters and shorelines of the United States is stipulated through
the OPA statute. The OPA encompasses oil spill prevention, preparedness, and response performance of
industry and the federal government. Incentives are provided to owners and operators for oil spill prevention,
enforced by the EPA through the oil spill liability and penalty provisions of the OPA. Oil companies in the
United States engage in oil exploration, both oshore and onshore, resulting in accidental releases of crude
petroleum into the environment from wells, drilling rigs, oshore platforms and oil tankers. With the
exception of the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill35 in the Gulf of Mexico, the number and amount of oil
spills have decreased over the past twenty years in the United States despite the increasing demand for oil.
This decline has been attributed to the OPA after the Exxon Valdez oil spill incident. The Exxon Valdez oil

oil spill, and has been made accountable for all cleanup costs and other damages by the federal government.

7.4.7 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
Information on all chemical substances and the control of any of these substances which may have an
unreasonable health risk has been granted to the EPA through the Toxic Substances Control Act (1976).
The manufacturer or the importer of a new chemical must provide information on the identity and hazard,
use, production volume and disposal characteristics of the chemical to the EPA. Toxicological tests and
unpublished health and safety studies on listed chemicals may be required by the EPA. The EPA may
approve, prohibit, or limit the manufacture and sale of the listed chemicals, or may require special labeling.
Since some chemical substances such as pesticides, tobacco products, nuclear materials, pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics substances are regulated under other acts, they are exempted from TSCA regulations.

289
The production and distribution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are prohibited through TSCA.
PCBs are synthetic organic compounds that were manufactured to be used as electrical transformer oil;
exposure to PCBs increases the risk of cancer, and may aect the reproductive and nervous systems. The
EPA enforces the handling and disposal of PCBs based on established regulations on PCBs, in addition
to management of PCBs found at hazardous waste sites. After the amendments of 1986 and 1990, TSCA
through the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act requires that all public and commercial buildings
identify, control and mitigate the asbestos hazard in these buildings.
7.4.8 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
Insecticides, fungicides and rodenticides are compounds that are employed to control or eliminate pest
populations (pesticides). The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1972 with
several subsequent amendments set guidelines for the use of pesticides in the United States. All manufacturers
or importers must register their pesticide products with the EPA, where registration is allowed for a pesticide
whose application does not have unreasonable adverse eects on the environment. Industries such as the
agricultural sector employ pesticides to control vermin and other pests in industrial processes and in the
workplace.
7.4.9 Pollution Prevention Act (PPA)
A pollution management system with a focus on generating less pollution at the source was established
through the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA) of 1990. The pollution prevention hierarchy stipulates that the
rst step in reducing pollution is to minimize the amount of waste that is generated by all activities and
processes, which is referred to as source reduction. When the generation of waste cannot be reduced at the
source, then the waste should be recycled in order to decrease pollution. A waste that cannot be reduced
at the source or recycled should go through treatment and disposal in an environmentally safe manner. A
Pollution Prevention Oce has been established by the EPA to promote source reduction as the preferred
option in the pollution prevention hierarchy. Pollution prevention is a voluntary measure on the part of
the polluting industry rather than a mandatory regulatory control enforced by the EPA and the individual
states; industry is only required to le a toxic chemical source reduction and recycling report with EPA
every year. Industry is given incentives to institute pollution prevention programs with the aim of realizing
the economic benets of pollution prevention to industry after the implementation of pollution prevention
programs.
7.4.10 Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)
The Occupational Safety and Hazard Act (OSHA) of 1970 and its amendment of 1990 aim to ensure safe
and healthful working conditions for workers through enforcement of standards developed under OSHA, and
to provide for research, training and education in the eld of occupational safety and health. The standards
for occupational health and safety are established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
and its state partners, which are enforced through inspections of industry and providing guidance on better
operating practices. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was established
to recommend occupational safety and health standards based on extensive scientic testing, which are
afterwards enforced by OSHA. Those industries which have followed OSHA standards have experienced a
decline in overall injury and illness rates, where the costs due to worker injuries, illnesses and compensation
associated with occupational safety are a major loss for industry. The OSHA standards for worker health
and safety are recommended to be used in conjunction with various industrial pollution prevention programs.
7.4.11 Summary
Environmental laws and regulations serve the purpose of limiting the amount of pollution in the environment
from anthropogenic sources due to industrial and other economic activities. Environmental regulations are

specic to dierent phases of the environment such as water and air. Government regulations help industry to
curtail the environmental impact of pollution, leading to the protection of human health and the environment.
Future environmental laws and policy should convey and work in tandem with the eorts of the public and
industry for a more sustainable economy and society.

smoke stack into the atmosphere. Risk assessment helps federal agencies and risk management decisionmakers arrive at informed decisions about actions to take to protect human health from hazards such as
air pollution, pictured here. Source: Alfred Palmer via Wikipedia39
Some of the real-world examples of risk assessment includes: establishment of national ambient air quality
and drinking water standards for protection of public health (e.g. ozone, particulate matter in outdoor air;
chromium, chloroform or benzene in water); establishment of clean-up levels for hazardous waste site remediation; development of sh consumption advisories for pregnant women and general population (e.g. PCBs,
mercury); assessment of risks and benets of dierent alternative fuels for sound energy policy development
(e.g. oxygenated gasoline, biodiesel); and estimation of health risks associated with pesticide residues in
food. The estimated risk is a function of exposure and toxicity, as described in detail in NAS (1983 (p. 301))
and EPA (1989 (p. 300)). The regulatory risk assessment follows a four-step paradigm using qualitative
and/or quantitative approaches. In quantitative risk assessment using either deterministic or probabilistic approaches, the risk estimates pertaining to an exposure scenario is particularly useful when comparing a
number of exposure or risk reduction measures among one another as an optimization protocol to determine
the best economically viable option for protection of public health and the environment. With environmental
sustainability and life-cycle analysis in the forefront of green technological innovation, energy, and economic
savings in the 21st Century, risk assessment will pay a pivotal role in discerning the option(s) with the
most benet in health protection and, thus, will be an integral part of any environmentally sustainability
analysis. Such comparative risk assessment can be performed for traditional approaches vs. environmentally

sustainable approaches. They can also be performed among dierent environmentally sustainable options for
an environmental pollution problem such hazardous waste site remediation and redevelopment, air quality
management in urban areas, pest management practices, agricultural health and safety, alternative energy
sources for transportation sources and among others.
The four steps of risk assessment are i) hazard identication (Section 7.5.3: Hazard Identication); ii)
toxicity (Section 7.5.4: Toxicity (Dose-Response Assessment)) (or dose-response) assessment; iii) exposure
assessment (Section 7.5.5: Exposure Assessment); and iv) risk characterization (Section 7.5.6: Risk Characterization), which are described below in detail. The emphasis is given in documenting the resources
necessary to successfully perform each step.
7.5.3 Hazard Identication
In the hazard identication step, a scientic weight of evidence analysis is performed to determine whether a
particular substance or chemical is or is not causally linked to any particular health eect at environmentally
relevant concentrations. Hazard identication is performed to determine whether, and to what degree,
toxic eects in one setting will occur in other settings. For example, is a chemical that is shown to cause
carcinogenicity in animal test species (e.g. rat, mouse) likely to be a carcinogen in exposed humans? In
order to assess the weight of evidence for adverse health eects, risk analysts follow the following steps (EPA,
1993 (p. 300)): (1) Compile and analyze all the available toxicology data on the substance of interest; (2)
Weigh the evidence that the substance causes a toxic eect (cancer of non-cancer health end-points); and
(3) Assess whether adverse health eect (or toxicity) could occur from human exposure in a real-life setting.
In the rst task of hazard identication, risk analyst examines the toxicity literature using the following
analytical tools in the order of importance:
• Epidemiological studies
• Controlled human exposure chamber experiments
• In-vivo animal bioassays
• In-vitro cell and tissue culture bioassays
• Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship Analysis (QSAR)
Among these, in-vivo animal bioassays are, by far, the most utilized source of information for hazard identication for chemicals and, on rare instances, for chemical mixtures (e.g. diesel). When available, wellconducted epidemiological studies are regarded as the most valuable source of human health hazard identi-
cation information since they provide direct human evidence for potential health eects. Epidemiology
is the study of the occurrence and distribution of a disease or physiological condition in human populations
and of the factors that inuence this distribution (Lilienfeld and Lilienfeld, 1980 (p. 301)). The advantages
of epidemiological studies for hazard identication are (EPA, 1989 (p. 300); EPA, 1993 (p. 300)): animal-tohuman extrapolation is not necessary, real exposure conditions, and a wide range of subjects with dierent
genetic and life-style patterns. However, epidemiological studies have a number of shortcomings, which limit
their usefulness in hazard identication. Some of these disadvantages include diculty in recruiting and
maintaining a control group; having no control over some of the non-statistical variables related to exposures, lifestyles, co-exposure to other chemicals, etc.; absence of actual exposure measurements along with
memory bias for retrospective studies; lengthy latency periods for chronic health eects such as cancer; and
poor sensitivity and inability to determine cause-eect relationships conclusively.
Animal bioassays remedy some of the weaknesses of epidemiological studies by allowing for greater control
over the experiment and are deemed to be reliable measurement of toxic eects, although they require "high
dose in animals-to low dose in humans" extrapolation. The selection of design parameters of animal bioassays
is critically important in observing or missing an actual hazard. These parameters include: animal species
selected for the experiment (rat, mouse); strain of the test species; age/sex of the test species; magnitude of
exposure concentrations/doses applied or administered; number of dose levels studied; duration of exposure;
controls selected; and route of exposure. Animal studies are characterized as acute (a single dose or exposures
of short duration), chronic (exposures for full lifetimes of test species  about two years in rats/mice) and

293
sub-chronic (usually 90 days) based on the exposure duration. In the hazard identication step, the following
measures of toxicity are commonly compiled:
• LD50/LC50/EC50: The dose or concentration in a toxicity study at which causing 50 percent
mortality in test species was observed. The EC50 is the eective concentration causing adverse eects
or impairment in 50% of the test species.
• NOAEL (No Observable Adverse Eect Level): The highest dose or concentration in a toxicity study
at which no adverse eect was observed.
• LOAEL (Lowest Observable Adverse Eect Level): The lowest dose or concentration in a toxicity
study at which an adverse eect was observed.
• MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose): The largest dose a test animal can receive for most of its lifetime
without demonstrating adverse health eects other than carcinogenicity.
Risk scientists rely on a number of reputable sources to gather, compile, and analyze hazard identication
information to be able to perform weight of evidence analysis and to conclude whether a chemical may cause
a health eect in humans. Some of these sources are:
• Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) maintained by the National Library of Medicine:

to cause cancer), genotoxicity (ability to damage genes), and biologic mechanisms (modes of action in the body) of the listed substance in humans and/or animals; b) the potential for human
exposure to these substances; and c) Federal regulations to limit exposures. The link to the most

7.5.4 Toxicity (Dose-Response Assessment)
Dose-response assessment takes the toxicity data gathered in the hazard identication step from animal
studies and exposed human population studies and describes the quantitative relationship between the
amount of exposure to a chemical (or dose) and the extent of toxic injury or disease (or response). Generally,
as the dose of a chemical increases, the toxic response increases either in the severity of the injury or in the
incidence of response in the aected population (EPA, 1989 (p. 300); EPA, 1993 (p. 300)). In toxicityassessment step, the relationship between the magnitude of the administered, applied, or absorbed dose and
the probability of occurrence and magnitude of health eect(s) (e.g. tumor incidence in the case of cancer)
is determined.
Dose-response assessment for carcinogens and non-carcinogens dier in toxicity values use and how these
toxicity values are derived. In general, toxicity values provide a measure of toxic potency of the chemical in
question. These toxicity values are:
• Reference Dose (RfD) for oral/dermal pathways or Reference Concentration (RfC) for
inhalation pathway  Noncarcinogens: A chronic RfD is dened as an estimate (with uncertainty
spanning perhaps an order of magnitude or greater) of a daily exposure level for the human population,
including sensitive subpopulations, that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious eects
during a lifetime. It has the unit of mg of pollutant per kg of body weight per day (mg/kg-day).
Chronic RfDs are specically developed to be protective for long-term exposure to a chemical, usually,
for exposure periods between seven years (approximately 10 percent of a human lifetime) and a lifetime.
After selection of a critical health eect study and a critical health eect through review of toxicity
literature in the hazard identication step, the RfD is derived by dividing the NOAEL (or LOAEL)
for the critical toxic eect by uncertainty factors (UFs) and a modifying factor (MF). The uncertainty
factors generally consist of multiples of 10, with each factor representing a specic area of uncertainty
inherent in the extrapolation from the available data (e.g. 10 for extrapolation from animals to humans;
10 for interhuman variability; 10 when LOAEL is used instead of NOAEL in deriving RfD; 10 when
NOAEL is obtained from a subchronic study rather than a chronic study). A modifying factor ranging
from >0 to 10 is included to account for additional uncertainties in the critical study and in the entire
data based on a qualitative professional assessment. The default value for the MF is 1.The NOAEL is
selected based on the assumption that if the critical toxic eect is prevented, then all toxic eects are
prevented (EPA, 1989). The derivation of toxicity value, RfD/RfC, for noncarcinogens assumes that
they are threshold chemicals, meaning there is a threshold below which no adverse eects are observed
in test species. This dose level (i.e. NOAEL) in animals is simply adjusted by a number of factors (UFs
and MF) to determine the safe dose level in humans (i.e. RfD) as shown by the following equation:
RfD =
NOAEL
UF1xUF2xUF3...xMF (7.5)

• Cancer Slope Factor (CSF) for oral/dermal pathway or Unit Risk Factor (URF) for
inhalation pathway  Carcinogens: Unlike the noncarcinogens, carcinogens assumed to be nonthreshold chemicals based on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assumption that a small
number of molecular events can evoke changes in a single cell that can lead to uncontrolled cellular
proliferation and eventually to cancer. In deriving slope factors, rstly, an appropriate dose-response
data set is selected. In this exercise, whenever available, human data of high quality are preferable
to animal data. However, if only animal data are available, dose-response data from species that
responds most similarly to humans with respect to metabolism, physiology, and pharmacokinetics is
preferred. When no clear choice is possible, the most sensitive species is chosen. Secondly, a model
to the available data set is applied and extrapolation from the relatively high doses administered
to test species in animal bioassay (or the exposures recorded in epidemiologic studies) to the lower
environmental exposure levels expected for humans is performed using the model. Although various
models have been developed for this purpose (e.g. probit, logit, Weibull), the linearized multistage
model has commonly been used by the EPA. After the data are t to the appropriate model, the upper
95th percent condence limit of the slope of the resulting dose-response curve is calculated, which is
known as the Cancer Slope Factor (CSF). It represents an upper 95th percent condence limit on the
probability of a response per unit intake of a chemical over a lifetime (i.e. dose). Thus, its units are
(mg/kg-day) -1. This indicates that there is only a ve percent chance that the probability of a response
could be greater than the estimated value of CSF. Because the dose-response curve generally is linear
only in the low-dose region, the slope factor estimate only holds true for low doses. Toxicity values
for carcinogenic eects also can be expressed in terms of risk per unit concentration of the chemical,
which are called unit risk factors (URFs). They are calculated by dividing the CSF by adult body
weight (70 kg) and multiplying by the adult inhalation rate (20 m3/day), for risk associated with unit
concentration in air (EPA, 1989 (p. 300)).
A number of regulatory agencies responsible for environmental and public health protection have devoted
resources in developing and documenting toxicity values for noncarcinogens (RfDs/RfCs) and carcinogens
(CSFs/URFs). The following hierarchy of sources is recommended by the EPA in evaluating chemical toxicity
for Superfund sites (EPA, 2003 (p. 301)):
• Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) and cited references, which is the prime
source for the chemical-specic toxicity value information and can be accessed via:
http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/index.cfm47
• The Provisional Peer Reviewed Toxicity Values (PPRTV) and cited references developed for the EPA
Oce of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Oce of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI) programs (not publicly available).
• Other toxicity values, which includes the following sources of toxicity values that are commonly consulted by the EPA Superfund Program48 when a relevant toxicity value is not available from either
IRIS or the PPRTV database:
· California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA) Toxicity Criteria Database, available at:
http://www.oehha.ca.gov/risk/chemicalDB/index.asp49 ;
· The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs,
addressing noncancer eects only). MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse noncancer health eects
over a specied duration of exposure. These substance-specic estimates, which are intended to
serve as screening levels, are used by ATSDR health assessors and other responders to identify
contaminants and potential health eects that may be of concern at hazardous waste sites. To
date, 137 inhalation MRLs, 226 oral MRLs and 8 external radiation MRLs have been derived and
can be found at: http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mrls/index.html50 ;

· The EPA Superfund Health Eects Assessment Summary Tables (HEAST) database and cited
references; and
· Additional sources of toxicity values.
There are a number of other valuable sources for toxicity values (RfDs/RfCs for non-carcinogens and
URFs/CSFs for carcinogens), which can be compiled via the following sources:
• EPA Region 9 tabulated "Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs)" or "Regional Screening Levels (RSL)" for Chemical Contaminants at Superfund Sites," which
also lists toxicity values (oral/inhalation RfD and oral/inhalation CSF) used in the
medium-specic PRG/RSL calculation for each chemical. This table can be accessed via
http://www.epa.gov/region09/waste/sfund/prg/index.html51
• The Hot Spot Guidelines published by California EPA for Air Toxics Program includes technical
background documentation for toxicity criteria/values for chemicals (i.e. Cancer Potency Factors (CPFs), which is equivalent to EPA's CSFs and Chronic Recommended Exposure Limits
(RELs), which are similar to USEPA's RfCs). The most recent version of REL Table is located at:
http://www.oehha.org/air/allrels.html52 . The Technical Support Document for CPFs that contains
cancer unit risks and potency factors for 121 of the 201 carcinogenic substances or groups of substances
can be accessed via http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/cancer_guide/TSD2.html53
.
• The Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) maintains Risk Assessment Information System (RAIS) website, which contains useful information for risk assessment, including chemical-specic toxicity values. The RAIS information can be accessed via
http://rais.ornl.gov/54
.
• Toxicology Excellence in Risk Assessment (TERA), a non-prot organization, manages and
distributes a free Internet database of human health risk values and cancer classications for over 600
chemicals of environmental concern from multiple organizations worldwide. This database, Integrated
Toxicity Estimates for Risk (ITER), can be accessed via: http://www.tera.org/iter/55 or via
NLM's TOXNET database at: http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov56
.
The dermal RfDs and CSFs can be derived from oral RfDs and CSFs, adjusted for chemical-specic gastrointestinal absorption eciency, based on the recommended methodology in EPA's Guidance for Dermal Risk
Assessment (EPA, 2004a (p. 301)).
7.5.5 Exposure Assessment
In the third step of risk assessment, the magnitude of exposure is determined by measuring or estimating the
amount of an agent to which humans are exposed (i.e. exposure concentration) and the magnitude of dose
(or intake) is estimated by taking the magnitude, frequency, duration, and route of exposure into account.
Exposure assessments may consider past, present, and future exposures.

While estimates of past or current exposure concentration/dose can be based on measurements or models
of existing conditions, estimates of future exposure concentration/dose can be based on models of future
conditions. In the case of inhalation exposures, personal or area monitoring to sample for contaminants in
the air can be employed. The sampling data can be augmented with modeling eorts using default and/or
site-specic input parameters. The model application can begin with simple screening level dispersion models
and/or can utilize higher-level 2-D or 3-D models depending on the complexity of the environmental pollution
problem in hand.
In any exposure assessment, the risk scientists ask a number of questions to hypothesize the exposure
scenario pertaining to environmental pollution aecting the population or a sub-group. Some of these are:
• What is the source of pollution at the site? (e.g. underground storage tank leak, emissions from an
industrial plant, surface water run-o from agricultural elds)
• Which environmental compartments are likely to be contaminated? (i.e. air, water, sediment, soil,
plants, animals, sh)
• What are the chemicals of concern (COC) originating from the pollution source?
• What are the fate and transport properties of these chemicals that may inform the aging of the pollution
in the environment over time and resultant chemical signature in each environmental medium?
• Who is exposed? (e.g. children, elderly, asthmatics, general population, workers)

298 CHAPTER 7. MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
• How many people are exposed?
• Where are people exposed? (e.g. home, workplace, outside environment, retirement communities,
schools)
• How are people exposed? (i.e. exposure pathway  inhalation, dermal contact or ingestion)
• How often are people exposed? (i.e. exposure frequency)
• How long are people exposed? (i.e. exposure duration)
Answers to these questions frame the problem at hand. In the next step, a number of exposure parameters
are integrated into an estimate of daily dose received by an exposed individual via each exposure route
(ingestion, dermal contact or skin absorption, and inhalation). The magnitude of human exposures, in
general, is dependent on COC concentration in soil, exposure parameters describing human physiology (e.g.
soil ingestion rate, body weight), and population-specic parameters describing exposure behavior (exposure
frequency, duration). When evaluating subchronic or chronic exposures to noncarcinogenic chemicals, dose
is averaged over the period of exposure, termed "Average Daily Dose" (ADD). However, for carcinogens,
dose is averaged over an entire lifetime (i.e. 70 years), thus referred to as "Lifetime Average Daily Dose"
(LADD). Both ADD and LADD represent normalized exposure rate in the units of mg of chemical per kg
body weight per day (mg/kg-day). The ADD for noncarcinogenic COCs and LADD for carcinogenic COCs
are estimated for four most commonly studied exposure pathways in EPA risk assessments, particularly for
hazardous waste sites, as shown below (Erdal, 2007 (p. 301)):
Soil Ingestion: L(ADD)

CF: Conversion factor  10-6 kg/mg
In deterministic risk assessment, ADD and LADD estimates are performed for a reasonable maximum exposure scenario (RME) and a central tendency exposure scenario (CTE), resulting in a range. EPA's reliance
on the concept of RME for estimating risks is based on a conservative but plausible exposure scenario (which
is dened to be the 90th to 95th percentile exposure, signifying that fewer than ve percent to 10 percent of
the population would be expected to experience higher risk levels), and has been scientically challenged over
the years. For example, Burmaster and Harris (1993 (p. 300)) showed that the use of EPA recommended
default exposure parameter values resulted in exposure and risk estimates well in excess of the 99th percentile
due to multiplication of three upper-bound values (i.e. 95th percentiles) for IR, EF, and ED. The authors
argued that this leads to hazardous waste site cleanup decisions based on health risks that virtually no one in
the surrounding population would be expected to experience. They advised the EPA to endorse and promote
the use of probabilistic methods (e.g. Monte-Carlo simulations) as a way to supplement or replace current

risk assessment methods, in order to overcome the problem of "compounded conservatism" and enable calculation of risks using a more statistically defensible estimate of the RME. In probabilistic risk assessment, the
input parameters are characterized by their unique probability distribution. The EPA's Exposure Factors
Program provides information on development of exposure parameter distributions in support of probabilistic
distributions and can be accessed via: http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=2056358
.
The values of the exposure parameters corresponding to RME or CTE scenarios are often compiled from
EPA's Exposure Factors Handbook (EFH):
• General Exposure Factors Handbook (EPA, 1997 (p. 301)) provides exposure assessors with data
needed on standard factors to calculate human exposure to toxic chemicals as part of risk assessments. These factors include: drinking water consumption, soil ingestion, inhalation rates,
dermal factors including skin area and soil adherence factors, consumption of fruits and vegetables, sh, meats, dairy products, homegrown foods, breast milk intake, human activity factors,
consumer product use, and residential characteristics. Recommended values are for the general
population and also for various segments of the population who may have characteristics different from the general population. The most recent version of the EFH can be accessed via
http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=20986659
.
• The Children-Specic EFH (EPA, 2002b (p. 301)) provides a summary of the available and
up-to-date statistical data on various factors assessing child exposures, which can be accessed via
http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=5674760
.
7.5.6 Risk Characterization
In the last step, a hazard quotient (HQ) as an indicator of risks associated with health eects other than
cancer and excess cancer risk (ECR) as the incremental probability of an exposed person developing cancer
over a lifetime, are calculated by integrating toxicity and exposure information, as shown below. If HQ >
1, there may be concern for potential adverse systemic health eects in the exposed individuals. If HQ ≤
1, there may be no concern. It should be noted that HQs are scaling factors and they are not statistically
based. The EPA's acceptable criterion for carcinogenic risks is based on public policy as described in the
National Contingency Plan (NCP) and is the exposure concentration that represent an ECR in the range of
10-4  10-6, i.e. 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 excess cancer cases (EPA, 1990 (p. 300)).
Noncancer Risk: HazardQuotient(HQ) = ADD
RfD
Excess Cancer Risk (ECR): ECR = L(ADD) xCSF
To account for exposures to multiple COCs via multiple pathways, individual HQs are summed to provide
an overall Hazard Index (HI). If HI >1, COCs are segregated based on their critical health end-point and
separate target organ-specic HIs are calculated. Only if target organ-specic HI > 1, is there concern for
potential health eects for that end-point (e.g. liver, kidney, respiratory system).
Cumulative Noncancer Risk: HazardIndex = HI =
Pn
COCNC=1 (HQo + HQd + HQi
)
Cumulative Excess Cancer Risk: Pn
COCC =1 ECR =
Pn
COCC =1 (ECRo + ECRd + ECRi)
Here, o, d and i subscripts express oral (ingestion), dermal contact and inhalation pathways.
As discussed above, the HQ, HI, and ECR estimates are performed for RME and CTE scenarios separately in the case of deterministic risk assessment. Although EPA published the probabilistic risk assessment
guidelines in 2001 (EPA, 2001 (p. 301)), its application has so far been limited. Proper evaluation of uncertainties, which are associated with compounded conservatism and potential underestimation of quantitative
risk estimates (e.g. due to the presence of COCs without established toxicity values), is intrinsic to any
risk-based scientic assessment. In general, uncertainties and limitations are associated with sampling and
analysis, chemical fate and transport, exposure parameters, exposure modeling, and human dose-response
or toxicity assessment (derivation of CSFs/RfDs, extrapolation from high animal doses to low human doses),
and site-specic uncertainties.

300 CHAPTER 7. MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
7.5.7 Conclusion
The improvement in the scientic quality and validity of health risk estimates depends on advancements in
our understanding of human exposure to, and toxic eects associated with, chemicals present in environmental and occupational settings. For example, life-cycle of and health risks associated with pharmaceuticals
in the environment is poorly understood due to lack of environmental concentration and human exposure
data despite extensive toxicological data on drugs. There are many other examples for which either data on
exposure or toxicity or both have not yet been developed, preventing quantitative assessment of health risks
and development of policies that protect the environment and public health at the same time. Therefore,
it is important to continue to develop research data to rene future risk assessments for informed regulatory decision-making in environmental sustainability and to ensure that costs associated with dierent
technological and/or engineering alternatives are scientically justied and public health-protective. One
area that, particularly, requires advancement is the assessment of health risks of chemical mixtures. Current
risk assessment approaches consider one chemical at a time. However, chemicals are present in mixtures in
the environment. Furthermore, physical, chemical and biological transformations in the environment and
interactions among chemicals in the environment may change the toxic potential of the mixture over time.
Thus, risk assessment is an evolving scientic discipline that has many uncertainties in all of the four steps.
These uncertainties should be thoroughly documented and discussed and the risk assessment results should
be interpreted within the context of these uncertainties.

Sustainable Energy Systems
8.1 Sustainable Energy Systems - Chapter Introduction1
8.1.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• outline the history of human energy use
• understand the challenges to continued reliance on fossil energy
• understand the motivations and time scale for transitions in energy use
8.1.2 Introduction and History
Energy is a pervasive human need, as basic as food or shelter to human existence. World energy use has
grown dramatically since the rise of civilization lured humans from their long hunter-gatherer existence
to more energy intensive lifestyles in settlements. Energy use has progressed from providing only basic
individual needs such as cooking and heating to satisfying our needs for permanent housing, farming and
animal husbandry, transportation, and ultimately manufacturing, city-building, entertainment, information
processing and communication. Our present lifestyle is enabled by readily available inexpensive fossil energy,
concentrated by nature over tens or hundreds of millions of years into convenient, high energy density deposits
of fossil fuels that are easily recovered from mines or wells in the earth's crust.
8.1.3 Sustainability Challenges
Eighty ve percent of world energy is supplied by combustion of fossil fuels. The use of these fuels (coal
since the middle ages for heating; and coal, oil and gas since the Industrial Revolution for mechanical
energy) grew naturally from their high energy density, abundance and low cost. For approximately 200 years
following the Industrial Revolution, these energy sources fueled enormous advances in quality of life and
economic growth. Beginning in the mid-20th Century, however, fundamental challenges began to emerge
suggesting that the happy state of fossil energy use could not last forever.
8.1.3.1 Environmental Pollution
The rst sustainability challenge to be addressed was environmental pollution, long noticed in industrial
regions but often ignored. Developed countries passed legislation limiting the pollutants that could be
emitted, and gradually over a period of more than two decades air and water quality improved until many
of the most visible and harmful eects were no longer evident.

304 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
8.1.3.2 Limited Energy Resources
The second sustainability issue to be addressed has been limited energy resources. The earth and its fossil
resources are nite, a simple fact with the obvious implication that we cannot continue using fossil fuels
indenitely. The question is not when the resources will run out, rather when they will become too expensive
or technically challenging to extract. Resources are distributed throughout the earth's crust  some easily
accessible, others buried in remote locations or under impenetrable barriers. There are oil and gas deposits
in the Arctic, for example, that have not been explored or documented, because until recently they were
buried under heavy covers of ice on land and sea. We recover the easy and inexpensive resources rst, leaving
the dicult ones for future development. The cost-benet balance is usually framed in terms of peaking 
when will production reach a peak and thereafter decline, failing to satisfy rising demand, and thus create
shortages? Peaks in energy production are notoriously hard to predict because rising prices, in response to
rising demand and the fear of shortages, provide increasing nancial resources to develop more expensive
and technically challenging production opportunities.
Oil is a prime example of peaking. Although the peak in United States oil production was famously
predicted by M. King Hubbert 20 years before it occurred, successful predictions of peaks in world oil
production depend on unknown factors and are notoriously dicult (Owen, Inderwildi, & King, 2010 (p.
308); Hirsch, Bezdek, &Wendling, 2006 (p. 308)). The fundamental challenges are the unknown remaining
resources at each level of recovery cost and the unknown technology breakthroughs that may lower the
recovery cost. Receding Arctic ice and the growing ability to drill deeper undersea wells promise to bring
more oil resources within nancial and technical reach, but quantitative estimates of their impact are, at
best, tentative.

8.1.3.3 Uneven Geographical Distribution of Energy
The third sustainability challenge is the uneven geographical distribution of energy resources. Figure Crude
Oil Reserves (Figure 8.1) shows the distribution of crude oil reserves, with the Middle East having far more
oil than any other region and Europe and Asia, two high population and high demand regions, with hardly
any by comparison. This geographical imbalance between energy resources and energy use creates uncertainty
and instability of supply. Weather events, natural disasters, terrorist activity or geopolitical decisions can
all interrupt supply, with little recourse for the aected regions. Even if global reserves were abundant, their

The nal and most recent concern is carbon dioxide emissions and climate change (see Chapter Climate and
Global Change (Section 3.1)). Since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established by
the United Nations in 1988, awareness of the links among human carbon dioxide emissions, global warming

and the potential for climate change has grown. Climate scientists worldwide have documented the evidence
of global warming in surface air, land and sea temperatures, the rise of sea level, glacier ice and snow
coverage, and ocean heat content (Arndt, Baringer, & Johnson, 2010 (p. 308)). Figure Temperature, Sea
Level, and Snow Cover 1850-2000 (Figure 8.2) shows three often quoted measures of global warming,
the average surface temperature, the rise of sea level and the northern hemisphere snow cover.

There can be no doubt of the rising trends, and there are disturbing signs of systematic change in other
indicators as well (Arndt, et al., 2010 (p. 308)). The short-term extension of these trends can be estimated
by extrapolation. Prediction beyond thirty or so years requires developing scenarios based on assumptions
about the population, social behavior, economy, energy use and technology advances that will take place
during this time. Because trends in these quantities are frequently punctuated by unexpected developments
such as the recession of 2008 or the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011, the pace of carbon emissions, global
warming and climate change over a century or more cannot be accurately predicted. To compensate for
this uncertainty, predictions are normally based on a range of scenarios with aggressive and conservative
assumptions about the degrees of population and economic growth, energy use patterns and technology
advances. Although the hundred year predictions of such models dier in magnitude, the common theme
is clear: continued reliance on fossil fuel combustion for 85 percent of global energy will accelerate global
warming and increase the threat of climate change.
The present reliance on fossil fuels developed over time scales of decades to centuries. Figure Primary
Energy Consumption by Source, 1775-2009 (Figure 8.3) shows the pattern of fuel use in the United
States since 1775.

Review, 2009, p. xx (Aug. 2010)7
Wood was dominant for a century until the 1880s, when more plentiful, higher energy density and less
expensive coal became king. It dominated until the 1950s when oil for transportation became the leading
fuel, with natural gas for heating a close second. Coal is now in its second growth phase, spurred by the
popularity of electricity as an energy carrier in the second half of the 20th Century. These long time scales
are built into the energy system. Uses such as oil and its gasoline derivative for personal transportation
in cars or the widespread use of electricity take time to establish themselves, and once established provide
social and infrastructural inertia against change.
The historical changes to the energy system have been driven by several factors, including price and
supply challenges of wood, the easy availability and drop-in replaceability of coal for wood, the discovery
of abundant supplies of oil that enabled widespread use of the internal combustion engine, and the
discovery of abundant natural gas that is cleaner and more transportable in pipelines than coal. These
drivers of change are based on economics, convenience or new functionality; the resulting changes in our
energy system provided new value to our energy mix.
The energy motivations we face now are of a dierent character. Instead of adding value, the motivation

is to avert "doomsday" scenarios of diminishing value: increasing environmental degradation, fuel shortages,
insecure supplies and climate change. The alternatives to fossil fuel are more expensive and harder to
implement, not cheaper and easier than the status quo. The historical motivations for change leading to
greater value and functionality are reversed. We now face the prospect that changing the energy system to
reduce our dependence on fossil fuels will increase the cost and reduce the convenience of energy.
8.1.4 Summary
Continued use of fossil fuels that now supply 85 percent of our energy needs leads to challenges of environmental degradation, diminishing energy resources, insecure energy supply, and accelerated global warming.
Changing to alternate sources of energy requires decades, to develop new technologies and, once developed,
to replace the existing energy infrastructure. Unlike the historical change to fossil fuel that provided increased supply, convenience and functionality, the transition to alternative energy sources is likely to be
more expensive and less convenient. In this chapter you will learn about the environmental challenges of
energy use, strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, electricity as a clean,
ecient and versatile energy carrier, the new challenges that electricity faces in capacity, reliability and communication, the challenge of transitioning from traditional fossil to nuclear and renewable fuels for electricity
production. You will also learn about the promise of biofuels from cellulose and algae as alternatives to
oil, heating buildings and water with solar thermal and geothermal energy, and the eciency advantages of
combining heat and power in a single generation system. Lastly, you will learn about the benets, challenges
and outlook for electric vehicles, and the sustainable energy practices that will reduce the negative impact
of energy production and use on the environment and human health.
8.1.5 Review Questions
Question 8.1.1
Fossil fuels have become a mainstay of global energy supply over the last 150 years. Why is the
use of fossil fuels so widespread?
Question 8.1.2
Fossil fuels present four challenges for long-term sustainability. What are they, and how do they
compare in the severity of their impact and cost of their mitigation strategies?
Question 8.1.3
The dominant global energy supply has changed from wood to coal to oil since the 1700s. How
long did each of these energy transitions take to occur, and how long might a transition to alternate
energy supplies require?

8.2 Environmental Challenges in Energy, Carbon Dioxide, Air, Water and Land Use9
8.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• outline environmental impacts of energy use
• evaluate the dierent energy sources based on their environmental impact
• understand the global capacity for each non-renewable energy source
8.2.2 Introduction
Energy to illuminate, heat and cool our homes, businesses and institutions, manufacture products, and drive
our transportation systems comes from a variety of sources that are originate from our planet and solar
system. This provides a social and economic benet to society. The earth's core provides geothermal
energy. The gravitational pull of moon and sun create tides. The sun makes power in multiple ways. By
itself, the sun generates direct solar power. The sun's radiation in combination with the hydrologic cycle
can make wind power and hydroelectric power. Through photosynthesis, plants grow making wood and
biomass that decay after they die into organic matter. Over the course of thousands of years, this decay
results in fossil fuels10 that have concentrated or stored energy. To learn more about measuring dierent
kinds of energy, known as emergy, see Chapter Problem-Solving, Metrics and Tools for Sustainability
(Section 9.1). Each of these types of energy can be dened as renewable or non-renewable fuels and they
each have some environmental and health cost.
Fossil fuel reserves are not distributed equally around the planet, nor are consumption and demand. We
will see in this chapter that fuel distribution is critical to the sustainability of fossil fuel resources for a given
geographic area. Access to renewable resources and their viability is greatly dependent on geography and
climate. Making energy requires an input of energy so it is important to look at the net energy generated 
the dierence of the energy produced less the energy invested.
8.2.3 Environmental and Health Challenges of Energy Use
The environmental impacts of energy use on humans and the planet can happen anywhere during the life
cycle of the energy source. The impacts begin with the extraction of the resource. They continue with
the processing, purication or manufacture of the source, its transportation to place of energy generation,
eects from the generation of energy including use of water, air, and land, and end with the disposal of
waste generated during the process. Extraction of fossil fuels, especially as the more conventional sources
are depleted, takes a high toll on the natural environment. As we mine deeper into mountains, further
out at sea, or further into pristine habitats, we risk damaging fragile environments, and the results of
accidents or natural disasters during extraction processes can be devastating. Fossils fuels are often located
far from where they are utilized so they need to be transported by pipeline, tankers, rail or trucks. These
all present the potential for accidents, leakage and spills. When transported by rail or truck energy must
be expended and pollutants are generated. Processing of petroleum, gas and coal generates various types
of emissions and wastes, as well as utilizes water resources. Production of energy at power plants results in
air, water, and, often, waste emissions. Power plants are highly regulated by federal and state law under the
Clean Air11 and Clean Water Acts12 , while nuclear power plants are regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission13 . As long as the facilities are complying, much of the environmental impact is mitigated by

8.2.4 Geopolitical Challenges of Fossil Fuels
The use of fossil fuels has allowed much of the global population to reach a higher standard of living. However,
this dependence on fossil fuels results in many signicant impacts on society. Our modern technologies and
services, such as transportation, landscaping, and plastics production depend in many ways on fossil fuels.
Meaning, if supplies become limited or extremely costly, our economies are vulnerable. If countries do not
have fossil fuel reserves of their own, they incur even more risk. The United States has become more and
more dependent on foreign oil since 1970 when our own oil production peaked. We imported over half of
the crude oil and rened petroleum products that we consumed during 2009. Just over half of these imports
came from the Western Hemisphere (see Figure Sources of United States Net Petroleum Imports,
2009 (Figure 8.5)).
Figure 8.5: Sources of United States Net Petroleum Imports, 2009 Figure illustrates that the
United States imported over half of the crude oil and rened petroleum products that it consumed during
2009. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Petroleum Supply Annual, 2009, preliminary
data14
The holder of oil reserves in the oil market is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries15
,
(OPEC) (see Figure Proven Oil Reserves Holders (Figure 8.6)). As of January 2009, there were 12
member countries in OPEC: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. OPEC attempts to inuence the amount of oil available
to the world by assigning a production quota to each member except Iraq, for which no quota is presently
set. Overall compliance with these quotas is mixed since the individual countries make the actual production
decisions. All of these countries have a national oil company but also allow international oil companies to
operate within their borders. They can restrict the amounts of production by those oil companies. Therefore,
the OPEC countries have a large inuence on how much of world demand is met by OPEC and non-OPEC
supply. A recent example of this is the price increases that occurred during the year 2011 after multiple
popular uprisings in Arab countries, including Libya.

This pressure has lead the United States to developing policies that would reduce reliance on foreign oil
such as developing additional domestic sources and obtaining it from non-Middle Eastern countries such as
Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, and Nigeria. However, since fossil fuel reserves create jobs and provide dividends
to investors, a lot is at stake in a nation that has these reserves. Depending on whether that oil wealth is
shared with the country's inhabitants or retained by the oil companies and dictatorships, as in Nigeria prior
to the 1990s, a nation with fossil fuel reserves may benet or come out even worse.
8.2.5 Nonrenewable Energy and the Environment
Fossil fuels are also known as non-renewable energy because it takes thousands of years for the earth to
regenerate them. The three main fuel sources come in all phases  solid, liquid, and gas  and will be
discussed in that order. One overriding concern is the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate
change. Figure Fuel Type and Carbon Emissions (Figure 8.7) displays the relationship between fuel
type and carbon emissions.

8.2.5.1 Solid Fossil Fuel: Coal
Coal comes from organic matter that was compressed under high pressure to become a dense, solid carbon
structure over thousands to millions of years. Due to its relatively low cost and abundance, coal is used
to generate about half of the electricity consumed in the United States. Coal is the largest domestically
produced source of energy. Figure Historic U.S. Coal Production (Figure 8.8) shows how coal production
has doubled in the United States over the last sixty year. Current world reserves are estimated at 826,000
million tonnes, with nearly 30 percent of that in the United States. It is a major fuel resource that the
United States controls domestically.

Coal is plentiful and inexpensive, when looking only at the market cost relative to the cost of other sources
of electricity, but its extraction, transportation, and use produces a multitude of environmental impacts that
the market cost does not truly represent. Coal emits sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury, which have
been linked to acid rain, smog, and health issues. Burning of coal emits higher amounts of carbon dioxide
per unit of energy than the use of oil or natural gas. Coal accounted for 35 percent of the total United
States emissions of carbon dioxide released into the Earth's atmosphere in 2010 (see Figure Fuel Type and
Carbon Emissions (Figure 8.7)). Ash generated from combustion contributes to water contamination.
Some coal mining has a negative impact on ecosystems and water quality, and alters landscapes and scenic
views. There are also signicant health eects and risks to coal miners and those living in the vicinity of
coal mines.
Traditional underground mining is risky to mine workers due to the risk of entrapment or death. Over
the last 15 years, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration has published the number of mine
worker fatalities and it has varied from 18-48 per year (see Figure U.S. Coal Mining Related Fatalities
(Figure 8.9)).

from 1995-2010. Source: C. Klein-Banai20 using data from the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety
and Health Administration21
Twenty-nine miners died on April 6, 2010 in an explosion at the Upper Big Branch coal mine in West
Virginia, contributing to the uptick in deaths between 2009 and 2010. In other countries, with less safety regulations, accidents occur more frequently. In May 2011, for example, three people died and 11 were trapped
in a coalmine in Mexico for several days. There is also risk of getting black lung disease (pneumoconiosis)22
This is a disease of the lungs caused by the inhalation of coal dust over a long period of time. It causes
coughing and shortness of breath. If exposure is stopped the outcome is good. However, the complicated
form may cause shortness of breath that gets increasingly worse.
Mountain Top Mining (MTM), while less hazardous to workers, has particularly detrimental eects on
land resources. MTM is a surface mining practice involving the removal of mountaintops to expose coal
seams, and disposing of the associated mining waste in adjacent valleys  "valley lls." The process of
MTM23 is described in more detail by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).

.
The following are some examples of the impact of MTM:
• an increase of minerals in the water that negatively impact sh and macroinvertebrates, leading to less
diverse and more pollutant-tolerant species
• streams are sometimes covered up by silt from mining
• the re-growth of trees and woody plants on regraded land may be slowed due to compacted soils
• aects the diversity of bird and amphibian species in the area since the ecosystem changes from wooded
areas to other
• there may be social, economic and heritage issues created by the loss of wooded land that may have
been important to traditions and economies of the area
A study by Epstein, et al. (2011) (p. 333) assigned a monetary value (full cost accounting) for the life cycle
of coal in the United States, accounting for many environmental and health impacts of coal. The authors
found the cost to be about $0.178/kWh of electricity generated from coal ($345.4 billion in 2008), doubling
or tripling the price of coal-generated electricity. This study accounted for all of the impacts discussed above
and more.
8.2.5.2 Liquid Fossil Fuel: Petroleum
Thirty seven percent of the world's energy consumption and 43 percent of the United States energy consumption comes from oil. As discussed above, most of the oil production is in the Gulf region. Scientists and
policy-makers often discuss the question of when the world will reach peak oil production, and there are a
lot of variables in that equation, but it is generally thought that peak oil will be reached by the middle of the
21st Century. Currently world reserves are 1.3 trillion barrels, or 45 years left at current level of production,
but we may reduce production as supplies run low.

318 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
8.2.5.2.1 Environmental Impacts of Oil Extraction and Rening
Oil is usually found one to two miles (1.6  3.2 km) below the surface. Oil reneries separate the mix of
crude oil into the dierent types for gas, diesel fuel, tar, and asphalt. To nd and extract oil workers must
drill deep below ocean oor. As the United States tries to extract more oil from its own resources, we are
drilling even deeper into the earth and increasing the environmental risks.
The largest United States oil spill to date25 began in April 2010 when an explosion occurred on Deepwater
Horizon Oil Rig killing 11 employees and spilling nearly 200 million gallons of oil before the resulting leak
could be stopped. Wildlife, ecosystems, and people's livelihood were adversely aected. A lot of money and
huge amounts of energy and waste were expended on immediate clean-up eorts. The long-term impacts are
still not known. The National Commission on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Oshore Drilling26 was
set up to study what went wrong. This video27 summarizes their ndings.
Once oil is found and extracted it must be rened. Oil rening is one of top sources of air pollution
in the United States for volatile organic hydrocarbons and toxic emissions, and the single largest source of
carcinogenic benzene.
When petroleum is burned as gasoline or diesel, or to make electricity or to power boilers for heat, it
produces a number of emissions that have a detrimental eect on the environment and human health:
• Carbon dioxide28 (CO2) is a greenhouse gas and a source of climate change.
• Sulfur dioxide29 (SO2) causes acid rain, which damages plants and animals that live in water, and it
increases or causes respiratory illnesses and heart diseases, particularly in vulnerable populations like
children and the elderly.
• Nitrous oxides30 (NOx) and Volatile Organic Carbons31 (VOCs) contribute to ozone32 at ground level,
which is an irritatant and causes damage to the lungs.
• Particulate Matter33 (PM) produces hazy conditions in cities and scenic areas, and combines with ozone
to contribute to asthma and chronic bronchitis, especially in children and the elderly. Very small, or
ne PM, is also thought to penetrate the respiratory system more deeply and cause emphysema and
lung cancer.
• Lead34 can have severe health impacts, especially for children.
• Air toxins are known or probable carcinogens.
There are other domestic sources of liquid fossil fuel that are being considered as conventional resources and
are being depleted. These include soil sands/tar sands  deposits of moist sand and clay with 1-2 percent
bitumen (thick and heavy petroleum rich in carbon and poor in hydrogen). These are removed by strip
mining (see section above on coal). Another source is oil shale in United States west which is sedimentary
rock lled with organic matter that can be processed to produce liquid petroleum. Also, mined by strip
mines or subsurface mines, oil shale can be burned directly like coal or baked in the presence of hydrogen
to extract liquid petroleum. However, the net energy values are low and they are expensive to extract and
process. Both of these resources have severe environmental impacts due to strip mining, carbon dioxide,
methane and other air pollutants similar to other fossil fuels.
8.2.5.3 Gaseous Fossil Fuel: Natural Gas
Natural gas meets 20 percent of world energy needs and 25 percent of United States needs. Natural gas is
mainly composed of methane, the shortest hydrocarbon (CH4), and is a very potent greenhouse gas. There

are two types of natural gas. Biogenic gas is found at shallow depths and arises from anaerobic decay of
organic matter by bacteria, like landll gas. Thermogenic gas comes from the compression of organic matter
and deep heat underground. They are found with petroleum in reservoir rocks and with coal deposits, and
these fossil fuels are extracted together.
Methane is released into the atmosphere from coal mines, oil and gas wells, and natural gas storage
tanks, pipelines, and processing plants. These leaks are the source of about 25 percent of total U.S. methane
emissions, which translates to three percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. When natural gas is
produced but cannot be captured and transported economically, it is "ared," or burned at well sites. This
is considered to be safer and better than releasing methane into the atmosphere because CO2 is a less potent
greenhouse gas than methane.
In the last few years a new reserve of natural gas has been identied - shale resources. The United States
possesses 2,552 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) (72.27 trillion cubic meters) of potential natural gas resources, with
shale resources accounting for 827 Tcf (23.42 tcm). As gas prices increased it has become more economical
to extract the gas from shale. Figure U.S. Natural Gas Supply, 1990-2035 (Figure 8.11) shows the past
and forecasted U.S. natural gas production and the various sources. The current reserves are enough to last
about 110 years at the 2009 rate of U.S. consumption (about 22.8 Tcf per year -645.7 bcm per year).

natural gas production from various sources. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration35
Natural gas is a preferred energy source when considering its environmental impacts. Specically, when
burned, much less carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide are omitted than from the combustion of coal or oil (see Table Environmental Impacts of Nonrenewable and Renewable Electricity
Sources). It also does not produce ash or toxic emissions.

320 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
8.2.5.3.1 Environmental Impacts of Exploration, Drilling, and Production
Land resources are aected when geologists explore for natural gas deposits on land, as vehicles disturb
vegetation and soils. Road clearing, pipeline and drill pad construction also aect natural habitats by clearing
and digging. Natural gas production can also result in the production of large volumes of contaminated water.
This water has to be properly handled, stored, and treated so that it does not pollute land and water supplies.
Extraction of shale gas is more problematic than traditional sources due to a process nicknamed fracking,
or fracturing of wells, since it requires large amounts of water (see Figure Hydraulic Fracturing Process
(Figure 8.12)). The considerable use of water may aect the availability of water for other uses in some
regions and this can aect aquatic habitats. If mismanaged, hydraulic fracturing uid can be released by
spills, leaks, or various other exposure pathways. The uid contains potentially hazardous chemicals such as
hydrochloric acid, glutaraldehyde, petroleum distillate, and ethylene glycol. The risks of fracking have been
highlighted in popular culture in the documentary, Gasland36 (2010).
Fracturing also produces large amounts of wastewater, which may contain dissolved chemicals from the
hydraulic uid and other contaminants that require treatment before disposal or reuse. Because of the
quantities of water used and the complexities inherent in treating some of the wastewater components,
treatment and disposal is an important and challenging issue.
The raw gas from a well may contain many other compounds besides the methane that is being sought,
including hydrogen sulde, a very toxic gas. Natural gas with high concentrations of hydrogen sulde
is usually ared which produces CO2, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and many other
compounds. Natural gas wells and pipelines often have engines to run equipment and compressors, which
produce additional air pollutants and noise.

8.2.6 Alternatives to Fossil Fuels
8.2.6.1 Nuclear Power
Nuclear power plants produce no carbon dioxide and, therefore, are often considered an alternative fuel, when
the main concern is climate change. Currently, world production is about 19.1 trillion KWh, with the United
States producing and consuming about 22 percent of that. Nuclear power provides about nine percent of
our total consumption for electricity (see Figure U.S. Energy Consumption by Energy Source, 2009
(Figure 8.13)).
However, there are environmental challenges with nuclear power. Mining and rening uranium ore and
making reactor fuel demands a lot of energy. The plants themselves are made of metal and concrete which
also requires energy to make. The main environmental challenge for nuclear power is the wastes including
uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. These materials have long
radioactive half-lives and thus remain a threat to human health for thousands of years. The U.S. Nuclear

322 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
Regulatory Commission38 regulates the operation of nuclear power plants and the handling, transportation,
storage, and disposal of radioactive materials to protect human health and the environment.
By volume, uranium mill tailings are the largest waste and they contain the radioactive element radium,
which decays to produce radon, a radioactive gas. This waste is placed near the processing facility or mill
where they come from, and are covered with a barrier of a material such as clay to prevent radon from
escaping into the atmosphere and then a layer of soil, rocks, or other materials to prevent erosion of the
sealing barrier.
High-level radioactive waste consists of used nuclear reactor fuel. This fuel is in a solid form consisting
of small fuel pellets in long metal tubes and must be stored and handled with multiple containment, rst
cooled by water and later in special outdoor concrete or steel containers that are cooled by air. There is no
long-term storage facility for this fuel in the United States.
There are many other regulatory precautions governing permitting, construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants due to risks from an uncontrolled nuclear reaction. The potential for
contamination of air, water and food is high should an uncontrolled reaction occur. Even when planning for
worst-case scenarios, there are always risks of unexpected events. For example, the March 2011 earthquake
and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan resulted in reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Station causing massive damage to the surrounding area.
note: Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station39
• March 11, 2011: Magnitude 9.0 earthquake 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. Less than 1 hour
later a 14m tsunami hit
• 50 power station employees worked around the clock to try to stabilize the situation
United States' nuclear reactors have containment vessels that are designed to withstand extreme weather
events and earthquakes. However, in the aftermath of the Japan incident, they are reviewing their facilities,
policies, and procedures.

8.2.6.2 Hydropower
Hydropower (hydro-electric) is considered a clean and renewable source of energy since it does not directly
produce emissions of air pollutants and the source of power is regenerated. However, hydropower dams,
reservoirs, and the operation of generators can have environmental impacts. Figure Hoover Power Plant
(Figure 8.14) shows the Hoover Power Plant located on the Colorado River. Hydropower provides 35 percent
of the United States' renewable energy consumption (see Figure U.S. Energy Consumption by Energy
Source, 2009 (Figure 8.13)). In 2003 capacity was at 96,000 MW and it was estimated that 30,000 MW
capacity is undeveloped.

Migration of sh to their upstream spawning areas can be obstructed by a dam that is used to create a
reservoir or to divert water to a run-of-river hydropower plant. A reservoir and operation of the dam can
aect the natural water habitat due to changes in water temperatures, chemistry, ow characteristics, and
silt loads, all of which can lead to signicant changes in the ecology and physical characteristics of the river
upstream and downstream. Construction of reservoirs may cause natural areas, farms, and archeological
sites to be covered and force populations to relocate. Hydro turbines kill and injure some of the sh that
pass through the turbine although there are ways to reduce that eect. In areas where salmon must travel
upstream to spawn, such as along the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon, the dams get in the way.
This problem can be partially alleviated by using sh ladders that help the salmon get up the dams.
Carbon dioxide and methane may also form in reservoirs where water is more stagnant and be emitted
to the atmosphere. The exact amount of greenhouse gases produced from hydropower plant reservoirs is
uncertain. If the reservoirs are located in tropical and temperate regions, including the United States, those
emissions may be equal to or greater than the greenhouse eect of the carbon dioxide emissions from an
equivalent amount of electricity generated with fossil fuels (EIA, 2011 (p. 333)).

8.2.6.3 Municipal Solid Waste
Waste to energy processes are gaining renewed interest as they can solve two problems at once  disposal
of waste as landll capacity decreases and production of energy from a renewable resource. Many of the
environmental impacts are similar to those of a coal plant  air pollution, ash generation, etc. Since the
fuel source is less standardized than coal and hazardous materials may be present in municipal solid waste
(MSW), or garbage, incinerators and waste-to-energy power plants need to clean the stack gases of harmful
materials. The U.S. EPA regulates these plants very strictly and requires anti-pollution devices to be
installed. Also, while incinerating at high temperature many of the toxic chemicals may break down into
less harmful compounds.
The ash from these plants may contain high concentrations of various metals that were present in the
original waste. If ash is clean enough it can be recycled as an MSW landll cover or to build roads, cement
block and articial reefs.
8.2.6.4 Biomass
Biomass is derived from plants. Examples include lumber mill sawdust, paper mill sludge, yard waste, or
oat hulls from an oatmeal processing plant. A major challenge of biomass is determining if it is really a more
sustainable option. It often takes energy to make energy and biomass is one example where the processing
to make it may not be oset by the energy it produces. For example, biomass combustion may increase or
decrease emission of air pollutants depending on the type of biomass and the types of fuels or energy sources
that it replaces. Biomass reduces the demand for fossil fuels, but when the plants that are the sources of
biomass are grown, a nearly equivalent amount of CO2 is captured through photosynthesis, thus it recycles
the carbon. If these materials are grown and harvested in a sustainable way there can be no net increase in
CO2 emissions. Each type of biomass must be evaluated for its full life-cycle impact in order to determine
if it is really advancing sustainability and reducing environmental impacts.

Figure 8.15: Woodchips Photograph shows a pile of woodchips, which are a type of biomass. Source:
Ulrichulrich42
8.2.6.4.1 Solid Biomass: Burning Wood
Using wood, and charcoal made from wood, for heating and cooking can replace fossil fuels and may result
in lower CO2 emissions. If wood is harvested from forests or woodlots that have to be thinned or from
urban trees that fall down or needed be cut down anyway, then using it for biomass does not impact those
ecosystems. However, wood smoke contains harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide and particulate matter.
For home heating, it is most ecient and least polluting when using a modern wood stove or replace insert
that are designed to release small amounts of particulates. However, in places where wood and charcoal are
major cooking and heating fuels such as in undeveloped countries, the wood may be harvested faster than
trees can grow resulting in deforestation.
Biomass is also being used on a larger scale, where there are small power plants. For instance, Colgate
College has had a wood-burning boiler since the mid-1980's and in one year it processed approximately
20,000 tons of locally and sustainably harvested wood chips, the equivalent of 1.17 million gallons (4.43
million liters) of fuel oil, avoiding 13,757 tons of emissions, and saving the university over $1.8 million in
heating costs. The University's steam-generating wood-burning facility now satises more than 75 percent
of the campus's heat and domestic hot water needs. For more information about this, click here43

8.2.6.4.2 Gaseous Biomass: Landll Gas or Biogas
Landll gas44 and biogas is a sort of man-made biogenic gas as discussed above. Methane and carbon
dioxide are formed as a result of biological processes in sewage treatment plants, waste landlls, anaerobic
composting, and livestock manure management systems. This gas is captured, and burned to produce heat
or electricity usually for on-site generation. The electricity may replace electricity produced by burning
fossil fuels and result in a net reduction in CO2 emissions. The only environmental impacts are from the
construction of the plant itself, similar to that of a natural gas plant.
8.2.6.4.3 Liquid Biofuels: Ethanol and Biodiesel
Biofuels may be considered to be carbon-neutral because the plants that are used to make them (such as
corn and sugarcane for ethanol, and soy beans and palm oil trees for biodiesel) absorb CO2 as they grow
and may oset the CO2 produced when biofuels are made and burned. Calculating the net energy or CO2
generated or reduced in the process of producing the biofuel is crucial to determining its environmental
impact.
Even if the environmental impact is net positive, the economic and social eects of growing plants for
fuels need to be considered, since the land, fertilizers, and energy used to grow biofuel crops could be used to
grow food crops instead. The competition of land for fuel vs. food can increase the price of food, which has
a negative eect on society. It could also decrease the food supply increasing malnutrition and starvation
globally. Biofuels may be derived from parts of plants not used for food (cellulosic biomass) thus reducing
that impact. Cellulosic ethanol feedstock includes native prairie grasses, fast growing trees, sawdust, and
even waste paper. Also, in some parts of the world, large areas of natural vegetation and forests have been
cut down to grow sugar cane for ethanol and soybeans and palm-oil trees to make biodiesel. This is not
sustainable land use.
Biofuels typically replace petroleum and are used to power vehicles. Although ethanol has higher octane
and ethanol-gasoline mixtures burn cleaner than pure gasoline, they also are more volatile and thus have
higher "evaporative emissions" from fuel tanks and dispensing equipment. These emissions contribute to the
formation of harmful, ground level ozone and smog. Gasoline requires extra processing to reduce evaporative
emissions before it is blended with ethanol.
Biodiesel can be made from used vegetable oil and has been produced on a very local basis. Compared
to petroleum diesel, biodiesel combustion produces less sulfur oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide,
and unburned and other hydrocarbons, but more nitrogen oxide.
8.2.6.5 Endless Sources of Energy: Earth, Wind, and Sun
8.2.6.5.1 Geothermal Energy
Five percent of the United States' renewable energy portfolio is from geothermal energy (see Figure U.S.
Energy Consumption by Energy Source, 2009 (Figure 8.13)). The subsurface temperature of the earth
provides an endless energy resource. The environmental impact of geothermal energy depends on how it is
being used. Direct use and heating applications have almost no negative impact on the environment.

Figure 8.16: Installing a Geothermal Pipe System Drilling to install geothermal ground source
pipe system. Source: Oce of Sustainability, UIC45
Geothermal power plants do not burn fuel to generate electricity so their emission levels are very low.
They release less than one percent of the carbon dioxide emissions of a fossil fuel plant. Geothermal plants
use scrubber systems to clean the air of hydrogen sulde that is naturally found in the steam and hot water.
They emit 97 percent less acid rain-causing sulfur compounds than are emitted by fossil fuel plants. After
the steam and water from a geothermal reservoir have been used, they are injected back into the earth.
Geothermal ground source systems utilize a heat-exchange system that runs in the subsurface about 20

feet (5 meters) below the surface where the ground is at a constant temperature. The system uses the earth
as a heat source (in the winter) or a heat sink46 (in the summer). This reduces the energy consumption
requires to generate heat from gas, steam, hot water, and chiller and conventional electric air-conditioning
systems. See more in Chapter Sustainable Energy Systems (Section 8.1).
8.2.6.5.2 Solar Energy
Solar power has minimal impact on the environment, depending on where it is placed. In 2009, one percent of
the renewable energy generated in the United States was from solar power (1646 MW) out of the eight percent
of the total electricity generation that was from renewable sources. The manufacturing of photovoltaic
(PV) cells generates some hazardous waste from the chemicals and solvents used in processing. Often solar
arrays are placed on roofs of buildings or over parking lots or integrated into construction in other ways.
However, large systems may be placed on land and particularly in deserts where those fragile ecosystems
could be damaged if care is not taken. Some solar thermal systems use potentially hazardous uids (to
transfer heat) that require proper handling and disposal. Concentrated solar systems may need to be cleaned
regularly with water, which is also needed for cooling the turbine-generator. Using water from underground
wells may aect the ecosystem in some arid locations.

8.2.6.5.3 Wind
Wind is a renewable energy source that is clean and has very few environmental challenges. Wind turbines
are becoming a more prominent sight across the United States, even in regions that are considered to have
less wind potential. Wind turbines (often called windmills) do not release emissions that pollute the air or
water (with rare exceptions), and they do not require water for cooling. The U.S. wind industry had 40,181
MW of wind power capacity installed at the end of 2010, with 5,116 MW installed in 2010 alone, providing
more than 20 percent of installed wind power around the globe. According to the American Wind Energy
Association48 , over 35 percent of all new electrical generating capacity in the United States since 2006 was
due to wind, surpassed only by natural gas.
Figure 8.18: Twin Groves Wind Farm, Illinois Wind power is becoming a more popular source of
energy in the United States. Source: Oce of Sustainability, UIC49
Since a wind turbine has a small physical footprint relative to the amount of electricity it produces, many
wind farms are located on crop, pasture, and forest land. They contribute to economic sustainability by
providing extra income to farmers and ranchers, allowing them to stay in business and keep their property
from being developed for other uses. For example, energy can be produced by installing wind turbines in the
Appalachian mountains of the United States instead of engaging in mountain top removal for coal mining.

O shore wind turbines on lakes or the ocean may have smaller environmental impacts than turbines on
land.
Wind turbines do have a few environmental challenges. There are aesthetic concerns to some people when
they see them on the landscape. A few wind turbines have caught on re, and some have leaked lubricating
uids, though this is relatively rare. Some people do not like the sound that wind turbine blades make.
Listen to one here50 and see what you think.
Turbines have been found to cause bird and bat deaths particularly if they are located along their
migratory path. This is of particular concern if these are threatened or endangered species. There are ways
to mitigate that impact and it is currently being researched.
There are some small impacts from the construction of wind projects or farms, such as the construction
of service roads, the production of the turbines themselves, and the concrete for the foundations. However,
overall life cycle analysis has found that turbines make much more energy than the amount used to make
and install them.
8.2.7 Summary
We derive our energy from a multitude of resources that have varying environmental challenges related to air
and water pollution, land use, carbon dioxide emissions, resource extraction and supply, as well as related
safety and health issues. A diversity of resources can help maintain political and economic independence for
the United States. Renewable energy sources have lower environmental impact and can provide local energy
resources. Each resource needs to be evaluated within the sustainability paradigm. In the near future, we
can expect the interim use of more dicult and environmentally-challenging extraction methods to provide
fossil fuels until the growth and development of renewable and clean energy sources will be able to meet our
energy demands.

8.3 Case Study: Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change59
8.3.1 Introduction
If increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are causing climate change, then how do we
reduce those emissions? Whether dictated by an international, national, or local regulation or a voluntary
agreement, plans are needed to move to a low-carbon economy. In the absence of federal regulation, cities,
states, government institutions, and colleges and universities, have all taken climate action initiatives. This
case study provides two examples of climate action plans  one for a city (Chicago) and one for an institution
(the University of Illinois at Chicago).
8.3.2 Chicago's Climate Action Plan
Urban areas produce a lot of waste. In fact, 75 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions are generated in urban
areas. Therefore, it is important for cities to develop plans to address environmental issues. The Chicago
Climate Action Plan60 (Chicago CAP) is one such example. The mid-term goal of this plan is a 25 percent
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and nal goal is 80 percent reduction below 1990 GHG levels
by the year 2050.
The Chicago CAP outlines several benets of a climate action plan. The rst would obviously be the
reduction of the eects of climate change. Under a higher emissions scenario as per the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change61 (IPCC), it is predicted that the number of 100 degree Fahrenheit days per
year would increase to 31, under the lower emissions scenario it would only be eight. Established by the
United Nations Environment Programme62 (UNEP), the IPCC is the leading international body that assesses
climate change through the contributions of thousands of scientists.
Second, there is an economic benet derived from increased eciencies that reduce energy and water
consumption. Third, local governments and agencies have great inuence over their city's greenhouse gas
emissions and can enhance energy eciency of buildings through codes and ordinances so they play a key
role in climate action at all governmental levels. Finally, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels helps the
United States achieve energy independence.

Figure 8.19: Chicago Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Reduction Goals Figure illustrates the
emissions calculated for Chicago through 2005. Source: City of Chicago, Chicago Climate Action Plan63
A good climate action plan includes reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, as far back as there is data,
preferably to 1990. Figure Chicago Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Reduction Goals (Figure 8.19)
depicts the emissions calculated for Chicago through 2005. From that point there is an estimate (the dotted
line) of a further increase before the reductions become evident and the goals portrayed can be obtained.
The plan was released in September 2008 and provides a roadmap of ve strategies with 35 actions to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and adapt to climate change. The strategies are shown in Table Alignment
of the Chicago and UIC Climate Action Plans (Table 8.1). Figure Sources of the Chicago CAP
Emission Reductions by Strategy (Figure 8.20) identies the proportion of emissions reductions from
the various strategies.

In 2010 CCAP put out a progress report66 wherein progress is measured by the many small steps that
are being taken to implement the plan. It is not translated exactly to emissions reductions but reports on
progress for each step such as the number of residential units that have been retrotted for energy eciency,
the number of appliances traded in, the increase in the number of rides on public transit, and the amount
of water conserved daily.
8.3.4 University Climate Action Plan
Several factors caused a major Chicago university to develop a climate action plan. As part of the American
College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment67 (ACUPCC), nearly 670 presidents have signed
a commitment to inventory their greenhouse gases, publicly report it, and to develop a climate action plan.
Part of the Chicago CAP is to engage businesses and organizations within the city in climate action planning.
In order to be a better steward of the environment, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) developed a
climate action plan68 . The goals are similar to Chicago's: a 40 percent GHG emissions reduction by 2030
and at least 80 percent by 2050, using a 2004 baseline. The strategies align with those of the city in which
the campus resides (see Table Alignment of the Chicago and UIC Climate Action Plans (Table 8.1)).
UIC's greenhouse gas reports are also made publically available on the ACUPCC reporting site69 . Figure

there are a number of recommended actions. Progress on this plan will be monitored both by reporting
emissions at least every two years to the ACUPCC and by tracking individual actions and reporting to the

8.3.5 Conclusion
There is no one approach that will eectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Climate action plans are
helpful tools to represent strategies to reduce emissions. Governmental entities such as nations, states, and
cities can develop plans, as can institutions and businesses. It is important that there be an alignment of
plans when they intersect, such as a city and a university that resides within it.

8.4.1.1.2 Introduction
Over the past century and a half electricity has emerged as a popular and versatile energy carrier. Communication was an early widespread use for electricity following the introduction of the telegraph in the 1840s.
In the 1870s and 1880s electric motors and lights joined the telegraph as practical electrical devices, and in
the 1890s electricity distribution systems, the forerunners of today's electricity grid, began to appear. The
telegraph became wireless with the invention of radio, demonstrated in the laboratory in the 1880s and for
transatlantic communication in 1901. Today, electricity is exploited not only for its diverse end uses such
as lighting, motion, refrigeration, communication and computation, but also as a primary carrier of energy.
Electricity is one of two backbones of the modern energy system (liquid transportation fuels are the other),
carrying high density energy over short and long distances for diverse uses. In 2009, electricity consumed
the largest share of the United States' primary energy, 38 percent, with transportation a close second at
37 percent (EIA Annual Energy Review, 2009 (p. 347)). These two sectors also accounted for the largest
shares of U.S. carbon emissions, 38 percent for electricity and 33 percent for transportation (EIA Annual
Energy Review, 2009 (p. 347)). Figure United States Electricity Net Generation Since 1949 and
Uses (Figure 8.22) shows the growth of electricity as an energy carrier since 1949 and the growing range of
its uses.

340 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
Figure Electricity Energy Chain (Figure 8.23) shows the electricity energy chain from generation to
use. By far most electricity is generated by combustion of fossil fuels to turn steam or gas turbines. This
is the least ecient step in the energy chain, converting only 36 percent of the chemical energy in the fuel
to electric energy, when averaged over the present gas and coal generation mix. It also produces all the
carbon emissions of the electricity chain. Beyond production, electricity is a remarkably clean and ecient
carrier. Conversion from rotary motion of the turbine and generator to electricity, the delivery of electricity
through the power grid, and the conversion to motion in motors for use in industry, transportation and
refrigeration can be more than 90 percent ecient. None of these steps produces greenhouse gas emissions.
It is the post-production versatility, cleanliness, and eciency of electricity that make it a prime energy
carrier for the future. Electricity generation, based on relatively plentiful domestic coal and gas, is free of
immediate fuel security concerns. The advent of electric cars promises to increase electricity demand and
reduce dependency on foreign oil, while the growth of renewable wind and solar generation reduces carbon
emissions. The primary sustainability challenges for electricity as an energy carrier are at the production
step: eciency and emission of carbon dioxide and toxins.

8.4.1.1.3 The Electricity Grid: Capacity and Reliability
Beyond production, electricity faces challenges of capacity, reliability, and implementing storage and transmission required to accommodate the remoteness and variability of renewables. The largest capacity challenges are in urban areas, where 79 percent of the United States and 50 percent of the world population
live. The high population density of urban areas requires a correspondingly high energy and electric power
density. In the United States, 33 percent of electric power is used in the top 22 metro areas, and electricity
demand is projected to grow 31 percent by 2035 (Annual Energy Outlook, 2011 (p. 347)). This creates an
"urban power bottleneck" where underground cables become saturated, hampering economic growth and the
eciencies of scale in transportation, energy use and greenhouse gas emission that come with high population
density (Owen, 2009 (p. 347)). Saturation of existing cable infrastructure requires installation of substantial
new capacity, an expensive proposition for digging new underground cable tunnels.
Superconducting underground cables with ve times the power delivery capacity of conventional
copper oer an innovative alternative (see Figure Superconducting Underground Cables (Figure 8.24)).
Unlike conventional cables, superconducting cables emit no heat or electromagnetic radiation, eliminating
interference with other underground energy and communication infrastructure. Replacing conventional with
superconducting cables in urban areas dramatically increases capacity while avoiding the construction expense of additional underground infrastructure.
Figure 8.24: Superconducting Underground Cables The superconducting wires on the right carry
the same current as the conventional copper wires on the left. Superconducting cable wound from these
wires carries up to ve times the current of conventional copper cables. Source: Courtesy, American
Superconductor Corporation
The reliability of the electricity grid presents a second challenge. The United States' grid has grown
continuously from origins in the early 20th Century; much of its infrastructure is based on technology and

342 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
design philosophy dating from the 1950s and 1960s, when the major challenge was extending electrication
to new rural and urban areas. Outside urban areas, the grid is mainly above ground, exposing it to weather
and temperature extremes that cause most power outages. The response to outages is frustratingly slow
and traditional  utilities are often rst alerted to outages by telephoned customer complaints, and response
requires sending crews to identify and repair damage, much the same as we did 50 years ago. The United
States' grid reliability is signicantly lower than for newer grids in Europe and Japan, where the typical
customer experiences ten to 20 times less outage time than in the United States. Reliability is especially
important in the digital age, when an interruption of even a fraction of a cycle can shut down a digitally
controlled data center or fabrication line, requiring hours or days to restart.
Reliability issues can be addressed by implementing a smart grid with two-way communication between
utility companies and customers that continuously monitors power delivery, the operational state of the delivery system, and implements demand response measures adjusting power delivered to individual customers in
accordance with a previously established unique customer protocol. Such a system requires installing digital
sensors that monitor power ows in the delivery system, digital decision and control technology and digital
communication capability like that already standard for communication via the Internet. For customers with
on-site solar generation capability, the smart grid would monitor and control selling excess power from the
customer to the utility.
Figure Smart Grid (Figure 8.25) illustrates the two-way communication features of the smart grid. The
conventional grid in the upper panel sends power one way, from the generating station to the customer,
recording how much power leaves the generator and arrives at the customer. In the smart grid, the power
ow is continuously monitored, not only at the generator and the customer, but also at each connection point
in between. Information on the real time power ow is sent over the Internet or another special network to
the utility and to the customer, allowing real time decisions on adding generation to meet changes in load,
opening circuit breakers to reroute power in case of an outage, reducing power delivered to the customer
during peak periods to avoid outages (often called "demand response"), and tracking reverse power ows for
customers with their own solar or other generation capacity. The conventional power grid was designed in the
middle of the last century to meet the simple need of delivering power in one direction. Incorporating modern
Internet-style communications and control features could bring the electricity grid to a qualitatively new level
of capability and performance required to accommodate local generation and deliver higher reliability.

that used on the Internet would add 'smart' operation of the electricity grid. Source: National Institute
of Standards and Technology84
Smart components incorporated throughout the grid would be able to detect overload currents and open
breakers to interrupt them quickly and automatically to avoid unnecessary damage and triggering a domino
eect cascade of outages over wide areas as happened in the Northeast Blackout of 2003. For maximum
eectiveness, such smart systems require fast automatic response on millisecond time scales commensurate
with the cycle time of the grid. Even simple digital communication meets this requirement, but many of
the grid components themselves cannot respond so quickly. Conventional mechanical circuit breakers, for
example, take many seconds to open and much longer to close. Such long times increase the risk of dangerous
overload currents damaging the grid or propagating cascades. Along with digital communications, new
breaker technology, such as that based on fast, self-healing superconducting fault current limiters, is needed
to bring power grid operation into the modern era.
8.4.1.1.4 Integrating Renewable Electricity on the Grid
Accommodating renewable electricity generation by wind and solar plants is among the most urgent challenges facing the grid. Leadership in promoting renewable electricity has moved from the federal to the state
governments, many of which have legislated Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) that require 20 percent
of state electricity generation to be renewable by 2020. 30 states and the District of Columbia have such
requirements, the most aggressive being California with 33 percent renewable electricity required by 2020
and New York with 30 percent by 2015. To put this legal requirement in perspective, wind and solar now
account for about 1.6 percent of U.S. electricity production; approximately a factor of ten short of the RPS
requirements. (Crabtree & Misewich, 2010 (p. 347)).

344 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
8.4.1.1.4.1 Renewable Variability
The grid faces major challenges to accommodate the variability of wind and solar electricity. Without
signicant storage capacity, the grid must precisely balance generation to demand in real time. At present,
the variability of demand controls the balancing process: demand varies by as much as a factor of two
from night to day as people go through their daily routines. This predictable variability is accommodated
by switching reserve generation sources in and out in response to demand variations. With renewable
generation, variation can be up to 70 percent for solar electricity due to passing clouds and 100 percent for
wind due to calm days, much larger than the variability of demand. At the present level of 1.6 percent wind
and solar penetration, the relatively small variation in generation can be accommodated by switching in and
out conventional resources to make up for wind and solar uctuations. At the 20 percent penetration required
by state Renewable Portfolio Standards, accommodating the variation in generation requires a signicant
increase in the conventional reserve capacity. At high penetration levels, each addition of wind or solar
capacity requires a nearly equal addition of conventional capacity to provide generation when the renewables
are quiescent. This double installation to insure reliability increases the cost of renewable electricity and
reduces its eectiveness in lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
A major complication of renewable variation is its unpredictability. Unlike demand variability, which is
reliably high in the afternoon and low at night, renewable generation depends on weather and does not follow
any pattern. Anticipating weather-driven wind and solar generation variability requires more sophisticated
forecasts with higher accuracy and greater condence levels than are now available. Because today's forecasts
often miss the actual performance target, additional conventional reserves must be held at the ready to cover
the risk of inaccuracies, adding another increase to the cost of renewable electricity.
8.4.1.1.4.2 Storing Electricity
Storage of renewable electricity oers a viable route to meeting the variable generation challenge. Grid
electricity storage encompasses many more options than portable electricity storage required for electric
cars. Unlike vehicle storage, grid storage can occupy a large footprint with little or no restriction on weight
or volume. Grid storage can be housed in a controlled environment, eliminating large temperature and
humidity variations that aect performance. Grid storage must have much higher capacity than vehicle
storage, of order 150 MWh for a wind farm versus 20-50 kWh for a vehicle. Because of these dierences,
the research strategy for grid and vehicle energy storage is very dierent. To date, much more attention has
been paid to meeting vehicle electricity storage requirements than grid storage requirements.
There are many options for grid storage. Pumped hydroelectric storage, illustrated in Figure Pumped
Hydroelectric Storage (Figure 8.26), is an established technology appropriate for regions with high and
low elevation water resources. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is a compressed air equivalent of
pumped hydro that uses excess electricity to pump air under pressure into underground geologic formations
for later release to drive generators. This option has been demonstrated in Huntorf, Germany and in
Mcintosh, Alabama. High temperature sodium-sulfur batteries operating at 300 ◦C have high energy density,
projected long cycle life, and high round trip eciency; they are the most mature of the battery technologies
suggested for the grid. Flow batteries are an attractive and relatively unexplored option, where energy
is stored in the high charge state of a liquid electrolyte and removed by electrochemical conversion to a
low charge state. Each ow battery requires an electrolyte with a high and low charge state and chemical
reaction that takes one into the other. There are many such electrolytes and chemical reactions, of which
only a few have been explored, leaving a host of promising opportunities for the future. The energy storage
capacity depends only on the size of the storage tank, which can be designed fully independently of the
power capacity that depends on the size of the electrochemical reactor. Sodium sulfur and ow batteries
store electric charge and can be used at any place in the electricity grid. In contrast, thermal storage applies
only to concentrating solar power technologies, where mirrors focus solar radiation to heat a working uid
that drives a conventional turbine and generator. In these systems, heat energy can be stored as a molten
salt in a highly insulated enclosure for hours or days, allowing solar electricity to be generated on demand
after sunset or on cloudy days. All of these options are promising and require research and development to

explore innovations, performance and cost limits.

8.4.1.1.4.3 How to Transmit Electricity Over Long Distances
The nal challenge for accommodating renewables is long distance transmission. As Figure Renewable
Resource Location vs. Demand Location (Figure 8.27) shows, the largest wind resources, located at
mid-continent, and the largest solar resources, in the southwest, are far from the population centers east
of Mississippi and on the West Coast. If these resources are to be used, higher capacity long distance
transmission must be developed to bring the renewable electricity to market. Although such long distance
delivery is possible where special high voltage transmission lines have been located, the capacity and number
of such lines is limited. The situation is much like automobile transportation before the interstate highway
system was built in the 1950s. It was possible to drive coast to coast, but the driving time was long and
uncertain and the route indirect. To use renewable electricity resources eectively, we must create a kind of
interstate highway system for electricity.

8.4.1.1.5 Summary
Electricity and liquid petroleum are the two primary energy carriers in the United States, and in the world.
Once produced, electricity is clean and versatile making it an appealing energy carrier for the future. The
challenges facing the electricity grid are capacity, reliability, and accommodating renewable sources such as
solar and wind whose output is variable and whose location is remote from population centers. Electricity
storage and long distance transmission are needed to accommodate these renewable resources.
8.4.1.1.6 Review Questions
Question 8.4.1.1.1
Electricity is the fastest growing energy carrier in the world, trailed by liquid fuels for transportation. Why is electricity more appealing than liquid fuels?
Question 8.4.1.1.2
A primary challenge for the electricity grid is capacity to handle the "urban power bottleneck" in
cities and suburbs. How can superconducting cables address urban capacity issues?
Question 8.4.1.1.3
Renewable wind and solar electricity is plentiful in the United States, but they are located remotely
from high population centers and their output is variable in time. How can these two issues be
addressed?

8.4.1.2 Fossil Fuels (Coal and Gas)88
8.4.1.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• outline the relative contributions of coal and gas to electricity generation and to carbon emissions
• understand the link between electricity generation and carbon emissions
• understand the challenges of sequestering carbon in geologic formations  chemical transformation,
migration, and longevity
8.4.1.2.2 Introduction
At present the fossil fuels used for electricity generation are predominantly coal (45 percent) and gas (23
percent); petroleum accounts for approximately 1 percent (see Figure Electricity Generation by Source
(Figure 8.28)). Coal electricity traces its origins to the early 20th Century, when it was the natural fuel for
steam engines given its abundance, high energy density and low cost. Gas is a later addition to the fossil
electricity mix, arriving in signicant quantities after World War II and with its greatest growth since 1990
as shown in Figure Growth of Fuels Used to Produce Electricity in the United States (Figure 8.29)
(EIA Annual Energy Review, 2009 (p. 352)). Of the two fuels, coal emits almost twice the carbon dioxide
as gas for the same heat output, making it signicantly greater contributor to global warming and climate
change.

8.4.1.2.3 The Future of Gas and Coal
The future development of coal and gas depend on the degree of public and regulatory concern for carbon
emissions, and the relative price and supply of the two fuels. Supplies of coal are abundant in the United
States, and the transportation chain from mines to power plants is well established by long experience.
The primary unknown factor is the degree of public and regulatory pressure that will be placed on carbon
emissions. Strong regulatory pressure on carbon emissions would favor retirement of coal and addition of gas
power plants. This trend is reinforced by the recent dramatic expansion of shale gas reserves in the United
States due to technology advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") of shale gas
elds. Shale gas production has increased 48 percent annually in the years 2006  2010, with more increases
expected (EIA Annual Energy Outlook, 2011 (p. 352)). Greater United States production of shale gas will
gradually reduce imports and could eventually make the United States a net exporter of natural gas.
The technique of hydraulic fracturing of shale uses high-pressure uids to fracture the normally hard shale
deposits and release gas and oil trapped inside the rock. To promote the ow of gas out of the rock, small
particles of solids are included in the fracturing liquids to lodge in the shale cracks and keep them open after
the liquids are depressurized. Although hydraulic fracturing has been used since the 1940s, is technologically
feasible, economic, and proven to enhance gas an oil recovery, it faces considerable environmental challenges.
In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate
New York, methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale gas extraction has been reported
(Osborn, (p. 352)Vengosh, Warner, & Jackson, 2011 (p. 352)). The public reaction to these reports has

been strong and negative, prompting calls for greater transparency, scientic investigation and regulatory
control to clearly establish the safety, sustainability and public condence in the technique. See Module
Environmental Challenges in Energy, Carbon Dioxide, Air and Water (Section 8.2) for more on
the process of hydraulic fracturing and its associated risks.

Press, gure 7.393
Beyond a trend from coal to gas for electricity generation, there is a need to deal with the carbon emissions
from the fossil production of electricity. Figure Global Carbon Cycle, 1990s (Figure 8.30) shows the
size of these emissions compared to natural uxes between ocean and atmosphere and from vegetation and
land use. The anthropogenic uxes are small by comparison, yet have a large eect on the concentration of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The reason is the step-wise dynamics of the carbon cycle. The ultimate
storage repository for carbon emissions is the deep ocean, with abundant capacity to absorb the relatively
small ux from fossil fuel combustion. Transfer to the deep ocean, however, occurs in three steps: rst to
the atmosphere, then to the shallow ocean, and nally to the deep ocean. The bottleneck is the slow transfer
of carbon dioxide from the shallow ocean to the deep ocean, governed by the great ocean conveyor belt
or thermohaline circulation illustrated in Figure Great Ocean Conveyor Belt (Figure 8.31). The
great ocean conveyor belt takes 400  1000 years to complete one cycle. While carbon dioxide waits to be
transported to the deep ocean, it saturates the shallow ocean and "backs up" in the atmosphere causing
global warming and threatening climate change. If carbon emissions are to be captured and stored (or

"sequestered") they must be trapped for thousands of years while the atmosphere adjusts to past and future
carbon emissions (Lenton, 2006 (p. 352)).

direction. The conveyor belt is responsible for transporting dissolved carbon dioxide from the relatively
small reservoir of the shallow ocean to much larger reservoir of the deep ocean. It takes 400 - 1000 years
to complete one cycle. Source: Argonne National Laboratory94
Sequestration of carbon dioxide in underground geologic formations is one process that, in principle,
has the capacity to handle fossil fuel carbon emissions (Olajire, 2010 (p. 352)); chemical reaction of carbon
dioxide to a stable solid form is another (Stephens & Keith, 2008 (p. 352)). For sequestration, there are
fundamental challenges that must be understood and resolved before the process can be implemented on a
wide scale.
The chemical reactions and migration routes through the porous rocks in which carbon dioxide is stored
underground are largely unknown. Depending on the rock environment, stable solid compounds could form
that would eectively remove the sequestered carbon dioxide from the environment. Alternatively, it could
remain as carbon dioxide or transform to a mobile species and migrate long distances, nally nding an
escape route to the atmosphere where it could resume its contribution to greenhouse warming or cause new
environmental damage. The requirement on long term sequestration is severe: a leak rate of 1 percent
means that all the carbon dioxide sequestered in the rst year escapes in a century, a blink of the eye on the
timescale of climate change.

352 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
8.4.1.2.4 Summary
Coal (45 percent) and gas (23 percent) are the two primary fossil fuels for electricity production in the
United States. Coal combustion produces nearly twice the carbon emissions of gas combustion. Increasing
public opinion and regulatory pressure to lower carbon emissions are shifting electricity generation toward
gas and away from coal. The domestic supply of gas is increasing rapidly due to shale gas released by
hydraulic fracturing, a technology with signicant potential for harmful environmental impact. Reducing
the greenhouse gas impact of electricity production requires capturing and sequestering the carbon dioxide
emitted from power plants. Storing carbon dioxide in underground geologic formations faces challenges of
chemical transformation, migration, and longevity.
8.4.1.2.5 Review Questions
Question 8.4.1.2.1
The United States' electricity supply is provided primarily by coal, natural gas, nuclear, and
hydropower. How safe are these fuel supplies from interruption by international disasters, weather
events or geopolitical tension?
Question 8.4.1.2.2
Natural gas reserves from shale are increasing rapidly due to increased use of hydrofracturing
technology ("fracking"). The increased domestic resource of shale gas has the potential to provide
greater energy security at the expense of greater environmental impact. What are the long-term
costs, benets, and outlook for tapping into domestic shale gas reserves?
Question 8.4.1.2.3
Anthropogenic carbon emissions are small compared to natural exchange between ocean and atmosphere and uxes from vegetation and land use. Why do anthropogenic emissions have such a
large eect on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?
Question 8.4.1.2.4
One proposal for mitigating carbon emissions is capturing and storing them in underground geologic
formations (sequestration). What scientic, technological and policy challenges must be overcome
before sequestration can be deployed widely?

8.4.1.3 Nuclear Energy97
8.4.1.3.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• outline the rapid development of nuclear electricity and its plateau due to public concerns about safety
• understand the dilemma nuclear electricity presents for sustainability  reduced carbon emissions and
long term storage of spent fuel
• understand the sustainable benets and proliferation threats of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel
8.4.1.3.2 Introduction
From a sustainability perspective, nuclear electricity presents an interesting dilemma. On the one hand,
nuclear electricity produces no carbon emissions, a major sustainable advantage in a world facing human
induced global warming and potential climate change. On the other hand, nuclear electricity produces spent
fuel that must be stored out of the environment for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, it produces
bomb-grade plutonium and uranium that could be diverted by terrorists or others to destroy cities and
poison the environment, and it threatens the natural and built environment through accidental leaks of
long lived radiation. Thoughtful scientists, policy makers and citizens must weigh the benet of this source
of carbon free electricity against the environmental risk of storing spent fuel for thousands or hundreds of
thousands of years, the societal risk of nuclear proliferation, and the impact of accidental releases of radiation
from operating reactors. There are very few examples of humans having the power to permanently change
the dynamics of the earth. Global warming and climate change from carbon emissions is one example, and
radiation from the explosion of a sucient number of nuclear weapons is another. Nuclear electricity touches
both of these opportunities, on the positive side for reducing carbon emissions and on the negative side for
the risk of nuclear proliferation.
8.4.1.3.3 Debating Nuclear Energy
Nuclear electricity came on the energy scene remarkably quickly. Following the development of nuclear
technology at the end of World War II for military ends, nuclear energy quickly acquired a new peacetime
path for inexpensive production of electricity. Eleven years after the end of World War II, in 1956, a very short
time in energy terms, the rst commercial nuclear reactor produced electricity at Calder Hall in Sellaeld,
England. The number of nuclear reactors grew steadily to more than 400 by 1990, four years after the
Chernobyl disaster98 in 1986 and eleven years following Three Mile Island99 in 1979. Since 1990, the number
of operating reactors has remained approximately at, with new construction balancing decommissioning,
due to public and government reluctance to proceed with nuclear electricity expansion plans. Figure Growth
of Fuels Used to Produce Electricity in the United States (Figure 8.29) and Figure Nuclear Share
of United States Electricity Generation (Figure 8.32) show the development and status of nuclear
power in the United States, a reection of its worldwide growth.

The outcome of this debate (Ferguson, Marburger, & Farmer, 2010 (p. 356)) will determine whether the
world experiences a nuclear renaissance that has been in the making for several years (Grimes & Nuttall, 2010
(p. 356)). The global discussion has been strongly impacted by the unlikely nuclear accident in Fukushima,
Japan101 in March 2011. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was caused by an earthquake and tsunami that
disabled the cooling system for a nuclear energy complex consisting of operating nuclear reactors and storage
pools for underwater storage of spent nuclear fuel ultimately causing a partial meltdown of some of the reactor
cores and release of signicant radiation. This event, 25 years after Chernobyl, reminds us that safety and
public condence are especially important in nuclear energy; without them expansion of nuclear energy will
not happen.

There are two basic routes for handling the spent fuel of nuclear reactors: once through and reprocessing (World Nuclear Association; Kazimi, Moniz, & Forsberg, 2010 (p. 356)). Once through stores spent
fuel following a single pass through the reactor, rst in pools at the reactor site while it cools radioactively
and thermally, then in a long-term geologic storage site, where it must remain for hundreds of thousands of
years. Reprocessing separates the useable fraction of spent fuel and recycles it through the reactor, using a
greater fraction of its energy content for electricity production, and sends the remaining high-level waste to
permanent geologic storage. The primary motivation for recycling is greater use of fuel resources, extracting
∼ 25 percent more energy than the once through cycle. A secondary motivation for recycling is a signicant
reduction of the permanent geologic storage space (by a factor of ∼ 5 or more) and time (from hundreds
of thousands of years to thousands of years). While these advantages seem natural and appealing from a
sustainability perspective, they are complicated by the risk of theft of nuclear material from the reprocessing
cycle for use in illicit weapons production or other non-sustainable ends. At present, France, the United
Kingdom, Russia, Japan and China engage in some form of reprocessing; the United States, Sweden and
Finland do not reprocess.

8.4.1.3.4 Summary
Nuclear electricity oers the sustainable benet of low carbon electricity at the cost of storing spent fuel
out of the environment for up to hundreds of thousands of years. Nuclear energy developed in only 11
years, unusually quickly for a major energy technology, and slowed equally quickly due to public concerns
about safety following Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. The Fukushima reactor accident in March 2011
has raised further serious concerns about safety; its impact on public opinion could dramatically aect the
future course of nuclear electricity. Reprocessing spent fuel oers the advantages of higher energy eciency
and reduced spent fuel storage requirements with the disadvantage of higher risk of weapons proliferation
through diversion of the reprocessed fuel stream.
8.4.1.3.5 Review Questions
Question 8.4.1.3.1
Nuclear electricity came on the scene remarkably quickly following the end of World War II, and
its development stagnated quickly following the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents. The
Fukushima disaster of 2011 adds a third cautionary note. What conditions must be fullled if the
world is to experience an expansion of nuclear electricity, often called a nuclear renaissance?
Question 8.4.1.3.2
Nuclear fuel can be used once and committed to storage or reprocessed after its initial use to
recover unused nuclear fuel for re-use. What are the arguments for and against reprocessing?
Question 8.4.1.3.3
Storage of spent nuclear fuel for tens to hundreds of thousands of years is a major sustainability
challenge for nuclear electricity. Further development of the Yucca Mountain storage facility has
been halted. What are some of the alternatives for storing spent nuclear fuel going forward?

8.4.1.4.2 Introduction
Strong interest in renewable energy in the modern era arose in response to the oil shocks of the 1970s,
when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries106 (OPEC) imposed oil embargos and raised
prices in pursuit of geopolitical objectives. The shortages of oil, especially gasoline for transportation, and
the eventual rise in the price of oil by a factor of approximately 10 from 1973 to 1981 disrupted the social
and economic operation of many developed countries and emphasized their precarious dependence on foreign
energy supplies. The reaction in the United States was a shift away from oil and gas to plentiful domestic coal
for electricity production and the imposition of fuel economy standards for vehicles to reduce consumption
of oil for transportation. Other developed countries without large fossil reserves, such as France and Japan,
chose to emphasize nuclear (France to the 80 percent level and Japan to 30 percent) or to develop domestic
renewable resources such as hydropower and wind (Scandinavia), geothermal (Iceland), solar, biomass and
for electricity and heat. As oil prices collapsed in the late 1980s interest in renewables, such as wind and
solar that faced signicant technical and cost barriers, declined in many countries, while other renewables,
such as hydro and biomass, continued to experience growth.
The increasing price and volatility of oil since 1998, and the increasing dependence of many developed
countries on foreign oil (60 percent of United States and 97 percent of Japanese oil was imported in 2008)
spurred renewed interest in renewable alternatives to ensure energy security. A new concern, not known
in previous oil crises, added further motivation: our knowledge of the emission of greenhouse gases and
their growing contribution to global warming, and the threat of climate change. An additional economic
motivation, the high cost of foreign oil payments to supplier countries (approximately $350 billion/year for
the United States at 2011 prices), grew increasingly important as developed countries struggled to recover
from the economic recession of 2008. These energy security, carbon emission, and climate change concerns
drive signicant increases in fuel economy standards, fuel switching of transportation from uncertain and
volatile foreign oil to domestic electricity and biofuels, and production of electricity from low carbon sources.
8.4.1.4.3 Physical Origin of Renewable Energy
Although renewable energy is often classied as hydro, solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, wave and tide, all
forms of renewable energy arise from only three sources: the light of the sun, the heat of the earth's crust,
and the gravitational attraction of the moon and sun. Sunlight provides by far the largest contribution to renewable energy, illustrated in Figure Forms of Renewable Energy Provided by the Sun (Figure 8.34).
The sun provides the heat that drives the weather, including the formation of high- and low-pressure areas
in the atmosphere that make wind. The sun also generates the heat required for vaporization of ocean water
that ultimately falls over land creating rivers that drive hydropower, and the sun is the energy source for
photosynthesis, which creates biomass. Solar energy can be directly captured for water and space heating,
for driving conventional turbines that generate electricity, and as excitation energy for electrons in semiconductors that drive photovoltaics. The sun is also responsible for the energy of fossil fuels, created from the
organic remains of plants and sea organisms compressed and heated in the absence of oxygen in the earth's
crust for tens to hundreds of millions of years. The time scale for fossil fuel regeneration, however, is too
long to consider them renewable in human terms.
Geothermal energy originates from heat rising to the surface from earth's molten iron core created during
the formation and compression of the early earth as well as from heat produced continuously by radioactive
decay of uranium, thorium and potassium in the earth's crust. Tidal energy arises from the gravitational
attraction of the moon and the more distant sun on the earth's oceans, combined with rotation of the earth.
These three sources  sunlight, the heat trapped in earth's core and continuously generated in its crust, and
gravitational force of the moon and sun on the oceans  account for all renewable energy.

Figure 8.34: Forms of Renewable Energy Provided by the Sun The sun is the ultimate source for
many forms of renewable energy: wind and running water that can be used for power generation without
heat or combustion, and photosynthesis of green plants (biomass) for combustion to provide heat and
power generation and for conversion to biofuels (upper panels). Solar energy can be directly captured
for water and space heating in buildings, after concentration by mirrors in large plants for utility-scale
power generation by conventional turbines, and without concentration in photovoltaic cells that produce
power without heat or combustion (lower panels). Source: G. Crabtree using images from Linuxerist107

As relative newcomers to energy production, renewable energy typically operates at lower eciency than
its conventional counterparts. For example, the best commercial solar photovoltaic modules operate at
about 20 percent eciency, compared to nearly 60 percent eciency for the best combined cycle natural gas
turbines. Photovoltaic modules in the laboratory operate above 40 percent eciency but are too expensive
for general use, showing that there is ample headroom for performance improvements and cost reductions.
Wind turbines are closer to their theoretical limit of 59 percent (known as Betz's law) often achieving
35  40 percent eciency. Biomass is notoriously inecient, typically converting less than one percent of
incident sunlight to energy stored in the chemical bonds of its roots, stalks and leaves. Breeding and genetic

modication may improve this poor energy eciency, though hundreds of millions of years of evolution since
the appearance of multicelled organisms have not produced a signicant advance. Geothermal energy is
already in the form of heat and temperature gradients, so that standard techniques of thermal engineering
can be applied to improve eciency. Wave and tidal energy, though demonstrated in several working plants,
are at early stages of development and their technological development remains largely unexplored.
8.4.1.4.4 Capacity and Geographical Distribution
Although renewable energies such as wind and solar have experienced strong growth in recent years, they
still make up a small fraction of the world's total energy needs. Figure Renewable Energy Share of
Global Final Energy Consumption, 2008 (Figure 8.35) shows the contribution of fossil, nuclear and
renewable energy to nal global energy consumption in 2008. The largest share comes from traditional
biomass, mostly fuel wood gathered in traditional societies for household cooking and heating, often without
regard for sustainable replacement. Hydropower is the next largest contributor, an established technology
that experienced signicant growth in the 20th Century. The other contributors are more recent and smaller
in contribution: water and space heating by biomass combustion or harvesting solar and geothermal heat,
biofuels derived from corn or sugar cane, and electricity generated from wind, solar and geothermal energy.
Wind and solar electricity, despite their large capacity and signicant recent growth, still contributed less
than one percent of total energy in 2008.

contribution of fossil, nuclear and renewable energy to global nal energy consumption in 2008. Source:
REN21. 2010. Renewables 2010 Global Status Report (Paris: REN21 Secretariat), p. 15114
The potential of renewable energy resources varies dramatically. Solar energy is by far the most plentiful,
delivered to the surface of the earth at a rate of 120,000 Terawatts (TW), compared to the global human
use of 15 TW. To put this in perspective, covering 100x100 km2 of desert with 10 percent ecient solar cells
would produce 0.29 TW of power, about 12 percent of the global human demand for electricity. To supply
all of the earth's electricity needs (2.4 TW in 2007) would require 7.5 such squares, an area about the size
of Panama (0.05 percent of the earth's total land area). The world's conventional oil reserves are estimated
at three trillion barrels, including all the oil that has already been recovered and that remain for future
recovery. The solar energy equivalent of these oil reserves is delivered to the earth by the sun in 1.5 days.
The global potential for producing electricity and transportation fuels from solar, wind and biomass
is limited by geographical availability of land suitable for generating each kind of energy (described as

the geographical potential), the technical eciency of the conversion process (reducing the geographical
potential to the technical potential), and the economic cost of construction and operation of the conversion
technology (reducing the technical potential to the economic potential). The degree to which the global
potential of renewable resources is actually developed depends on many unknown factors such as the future
extent of economic and technological advancement in the developing and developed worlds, the degree of
globalization through business, intellectual and social links among countries and regions, and the relative
importance of environmental and social agendas compared to economic and material objectives. Scenarios
evaluating the development of renewable energy resources under various assumptions about the world's
economic, technological and social trajectories show that solar energy has 20-50 times the potential of wind
or biomass for producing electricity, and that each separately has sucient potential to provide the world's
electricity needs in 2050 (de Vries, 2007 (p. 366))
The geographical distribution of useable renewable energy is quite uneven. Sunlight, often thought to
be relatively evenly distributed, is concentrated in deserts where cloud cover is rare. Winds are up to 50
percent stronger and steadier oshore than on land. Hydroelectric potential is concentrated in mountainous
regions with high rainfall and snowmelt. Biomass requires available land that does not compete with food
production, and adequate sun and rain to support growth. Figure Renewable Electricity Opportunities
(Figure 8.36) shows the geographical distribution of renewable electricity opportunities that are likely to be
economically attractive in 2050 under an aggressive world development scenario.

8.4.1.4.5 Wind and Solar Resources in the United States
The United States has abundant renewable resources. The solar resources of the United States, Germany
and Spain are compared in Figure Solar Resources of the United States, Spain and Germany
(Figure 8.37). The solar irradiation in the southwestern United States is exceptional, equivalent to that of
Africa and Australia, which contain the best solar resources in the world. Much of the United States has solar
irradiation as good or better than Spain, considered the best in Europe, and much higher than Germany.
The variation in irradiation over the United States is about a factor two, quite homogeneous compared to
other renewable resources. The size of the United States adds to its resource, making it a prime opportunity
for solar development.
Figure 8.37: Solar Resources of the United States, Spain and Germany The solar resources
of the United States, Spain and Germany, expressed as solar insolation averaged over the year. The
geographic variation of solar irradiation in the United States is only a factor of two, much less than for
other renewable energy sources. Source: U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Eciency and Renewable
Energy, 2008 Solar Technologies Market Report, DOE/GO-102010-2867 (January, 2010), p52.116
The wind resource of the United States, while abundant, is less homogeneous. Strong winds require
steady gradients of temperature and pressure to drive and sustain them, and these are frequently associated
with topological features such as mountain ranges or coastlines. The onshore wind map of the United States
shows this pattern, with the best wind along a north-south corridor roughly at mid-continent (Figure 80
Meter Wind Resource Map (Figure 8.38)). Oshore winds over the Great Lakes and the east and west

coasts are stronger and steadier though they cover smaller areas. The technical potential for onshore wind
is over 8000 GW of capacity (Lu, 2009 (p. 366); Black & Veatch, 2007 (p. 366)) and oshore is 800  3000
GW (Lu, 2009 (p. 366); Schwartz, Heimiller, Haymes, & Musial, 2010 (p. 366)). For comparison, the United
States used electricity in 2009 at the rate of 450 GW averaged over the day-night and summer-winter peaks
and valleys.

States at 80 meters. Also see oshore wind resource maps117

8.4.1.4.6 Barriers to Deployment
Renewable energy faces several barriers to its widespread deployment. Cost is one of the most serious, illustrated in Figure Production Cost of Electricity - 2020 Projection (Figure 8.39). Although the cost
of renewables has declined signicantly in recent years, most are still higher in cost than traditional fossil

chemical phenomena of the energy conversion process. As Figure Production Cost of Electricity - 2020
Projection (Figure 8.39) shows, the lowest cost electricity is generated by natural gas and coal, with hydro
and wind among the renewable challengers. Cost, however, is not an isolated metric; it must be compared
with the alternatives. One of the uncertainties of the present business environment is the ultimate cost of
carbon emissions. If governments put a price on carbon emission to compensate the social cost of global
warming and the threat of climate change, the relative cost of renewables will become more appealing even
if their absolute cost does not change. This policy uncertainty in the eventual cost of carbon-based power
generation is a major factor in the future economic appeal of renewable energy.

A second barrier to widespread deployment of renewable energy is public opinion. In the consumer
market, sales directly sample public opinion and the connection between deployment and public acceptance

is immediate. Renewable energy is not a choice that individual consumers make. Instead, energy choices are
made by government policy makers at city, state and federal levels, who balance concerns for the common
good, for fairness to stakeholders, and for economic cost. Nevertheless, public acceptance is a major factor
in balancing these concerns: a strongly favored or disfavored energy option will be reected in government
decisions through representatives elected by or responding to the public. Figure Acceptance of Dierent
Sources of Energy (Figure 8.40) shows the public acceptance of renewable and fossil electricity options.
The range of acceptance goes from strongly positive for solar to strongly negative for nuclear. The disparity
in the public acceptance and economic cost of these two energy alternatives is striking: solar is at once the
most expensive alternative and the most acceptable to the public.
The importance of public opinion is illustrated by the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011120 . The
earthquake and tsunami that ultimately caused meltdown of fuel in several reactors of the Fukushima complex
and release of radiation in a populated area caused many of the public in many countries to question the
safety of reactors and of the nuclear electricity enterprise generally. The response was rapid, with some
countries registering public consensus for drastic action such as shutting down nuclear electricity when the
licenses for the presently operating reactors expire. Although its ultimate resolution is uncertain, the sudden
and serious impact of the Fukushima event on public opinion shows the key role that social acceptance plays
in determining our energy trajectory.

8.4.1.4.7 Summary
Strong interest in renewable energy arose in the 1970s as a response to the shortage and high price of imported
oil, which disrupted the orderly operation of the economies and societies of many developed countries.
Today there are new motivations, including the realization that growing greenhouse gas emission accelerates
global warming and threatens climate change, the growing dependence of many countries on foreign oil, and
the economic drain of foreign oil payments that slow economic growth and job creation. There are three

ultimate sources of all renewable and fossil energies: sunlight, the heat in the earth's core and crust, and the
gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the oceans. Renewable energies are relatively recently developed
and typically operate at lower eciencies than mature fossil technologies. Like early fossil technologies,
however, renewables can be expected to improve their eciency and lower their cost over time, promoting
their economic competitiveness and widespread deployment.
The future deployment of renewable energies depends on many factors, including the availability of
suitable land, the technological cost of conversion to electricity or other uses, the costs of competing energy
technologies, and the future need for energy. Scenario analyses indicate that renewable energies are likely
to be technically and economically capable of supplying the world's electricity needs in 2050. In addition to
cost, public acceptance is a key factor in the widespread deployment of renewable energy.
8.4.1.4.8 Review Questions
Question 8.4.1.4.1
What events in the 1970s and late 1990s motivated the modern interest in renewable energy?
Question 8.4.1.4.2
Renewable energy is often divided into solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, geothermal, wave and
tide. What are the ultimate sources of each of these renewable energies? What is the ultimate
source of fossil fuel and why is it not classied as renewable?
Question 8.4.1.4.3
Renewable energy has the technical potential to supply global electricity needs in 2050. What
factors determine whether renewable energy will actually be deployed to meet this need? How
can unknowns, such as the rate of technological and economic advances, the economic, intellectual
and social connections among countries, and the relative importance of environmental and social
agendas be taken into account in determining the course of deployment of renewable energy?
Question 8.4.1.4.4
Public acceptance is a key factor in the growth of renewable energy options. What is the public
acceptance of various energy options, and how might these change over the next few decades?

8.4.2 Liquid Fuels
8.4.2.1 Fossil Fuel (Oil)126
8.4.2.1.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, the student should be able to
• outline the global dependence of transportation on oil
• understand the threat to energy security posed by concentration of oil in a few countries
• understand the challenge of capturing carbon emissions from transportation and the value of replacing
oil with an alternate, such as biofuel or electricity
8.4.2.1.2 Introduction
Liquid petroleum fuels and electricity are the two dominant energy carriers in the United States, oil
accounting for 37 percent of primary energy and electricity for 38 percent. These two energy carriers
account for a similar fraction of carbon emissions, 36 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Two thirds of
oil consumption is devoted to transportation, providing fuel for cars, trucks, trains and airplanes. For the
United States and most developed societies, transportation is woven into the fabric of our lives, a necessity
as central to daily operations as food or shelter. The concentration of oil reserves in a few regions or the
world (Figure Crude Oil Reserves (Figure 8.1)) makes much of the world dependent on imported energy
for transportation.
The rise in the price of oil in the last decade makes dependence on imported energy for transportation
an economic as well as an energy issue. The United States, for example, now spends upwards of $350 billion
annually on imported oil, a drain of economic resources that could be used to stimulate growth, create jobs,
build infrastructure and promote social advances at home.
From a sustainability perspective, oil presents several challenges. First is the length of time over which
the world's nite oil reserves can continue to supply rising demand. Second is the impact on global warming
and climate change that carbon emissions from oil combustion will have, and third is the challenge of nding
a sustainable replacement for oil for transportation. The rst challenge, how much oil is left and when its
production will peak, was discussed in Module Sustainable Energy Systems - Chapter Introduction
(Section 8.1). The bottom line is that, as Yogi Berra famously said, making predictions is dicult, especially
about the future. Although we know the general course of initial rise and ultimate fall that global oil
production must take, we do not know with condence the time scale over which it will play out.
The uncertainty of the timing of the peak in global oil production encourages us to nd other issues and
motivations for dealing with an inevitably unsustainable supply. A prime motivation is energy security, the
threat that oil supplies could be interrupted by any of several events including weather, natural disaster,
terrorism and geopolitics. Much of the world feels these threats are good reasons for concerted eort to nd
replacements for oil as our primary transportation fuel. A second motivation is the environmental damage
and accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to transportation emissions. Unlike electricity
generation, transportation emissions arise from millions of tiny sources, e.g. the tailpipes of cars and trucks
and the exhaust of trains and airplanes. The challenge of capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide from
these distributed and moving sources is dramatically greater than from the large xed sources of power
plants. A more achievable objective may be replacing oil as a transportation fuel with biofuel that recycles
naturally each year from tailpipes of cars to biofuel crops that do not compete with food crops. Other

options include replacing liquid fuels with electricity produced domestically, or increasing the eciency of
vehicles by reducing their weight, regeneratively capturing braking energy, and improving engine eciency.
Each of these options has promise and each must overcome challenges.
Changes in the energy system are inevitably slow, because of the time needed to develop new technologies
and the operational inertia of phasing out the infrastructure of an existing technology to make room for a
successor. The transportation system exhibits this operational inertia, governed by the turnover time for the
eet of vehicles, about 15 years. Although that time scale is long compared to economic cycles, the prot
horizon of corporations and the political horizon of elected ocials, it is important to begin now to identify
and develop sustainable alternatives to oil as a transportation fuel. The timescale from innovation of new
approaches and materials to market deployment is typically 20 years or more, well matched to the operational
inertia of the transportation system. The challenge is to initiate innovative research and development for
alternative transportation systems and sustain it continuously until the alternatives are established.
8.4.2.1.3 Summary
Oil for transportation and electricity generation are the two biggest users of primary energy and producers
of carbon emissions in the United States. Transportation is almost completely dependent on oil and internal
combustion engines for its energy. The concentration of oil in a few regions of the world creates a transportation energy security issue. Unlike electricity generation emissions, carbon emissions from transportation are
dicult to capture because their sources, the tailpipes of vehicles, are many and moving. The challenges of
oil energy security and capturing the carbon emissions of vehicles motivate the search for an oil replacement,
such as biofuels, electricity or greater energy eciency of vehicles.
8.4.2.1.4 Review Questions
Question 8.4.2.1.1
The almost exclusive dependence of the transportation system on liquid fuels makes oil an essential
commodity for the orderly operation of many societies. What are some alternatives to oil as a
transportation fuel?
Question 8.4.2.1.2
There are many reasons to reduce consumption of oil, including an ultimately nite supply, the
high cost and lost economic stimulus of payments to foreign producers, the threat of interruption
of supply due to weather, natural disaster, terrorism or geopolitical decisions, and the threat of
climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions. Which of these reasons are the most important?
Will their relative importance change with time?
Question 8.4.2.1.3
The transportation system changes slowly, governed by the lifetime of the eet of vehicles. Compare
the time required for change in the transportation system with the timescale of economic cycles, the
prot horizon of business, the political horizon of elected ocials and the time required to develop
new transportation technologies such as electric cars or biofuels. What challenges do these time
scales present for changing the transportation system?

8.4.2.2 The Conversion of Biomass into Biofuels128
8.4.2.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the social and environmental motivations for biofuels production
• learn the main types of catalytic and biocatalytic routes to produce biofuels and biochemicals
• compare alcohol (ethanol and butanol) biofuels to hydrocarbon biofuels (green gasoline, diesel, and jet
fuel)
8.4.2.2.2 Introduction
Biofuels are fuels made from biomass. The best known example is ethanol, which can be easily fermented
from sugar cane juice, as is done in Brazil. Ethanol can also be fermented from broken down (saccaried)
corn starch, as is mainly done in the United States. Most recently, eorts have been devoted to making
drop-in replacement hydrocarbon biofuels called green gasoline, green diesel, or green jet fuel. This chapter
discusses the need for biofuels, the types of biofuels that can be produced from the various available biomass
feedstocks, and the advantages and disadvantages of each fuel and feedstock. The various ways of producing
biofuels are also reviewed.
8.4.2.2.3 The Need for Renewable Transportation Fuels
In crude oil, coal, and natural gas, (collectively called fossil fuels) our planet has provided us with sources of
energy that have been easy to obtain and convert into useful fuels and chemicals. That situation will soon
change, however, in a few decades for petroleum crude and in a few centuries for coal and natural gas. Peak
oil refers to the peak in oil production that must occur as petroleum crude runs out. As shown in Figure
Peak Oil  The Growing Gap (Figure 8.41), the main discoveries of crude oil occurred prior to 1980.

Figure 8.41: Peak Oil  The Growing Gap Petroleum crude oil discoveries versus rened oil
production. Source: Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, Maryland129
Since oil is getting harder and harder to nd, we now have to obtain it from less accessible places such
as far under the ocean, which has led to hard-to-repair accidents such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill130
in May, 2010. An additional eect is the higher cost of rening the petroleum since it comes from more
remote locations or in less desirable forms such as thick, rocky tar sand or oil sand found in Canada
or Venezuela. Overall, the use of petroleum crude cannot exceed the amount of petroleum that has been
discovered, and assuming that no major oil discoveries lie ahead, the production of oil from crude must start
to decrease. Some analysts think that this peak has already happened.
An additional aspect of oil scarcity is energy independence. The United States currently imports about
two thirds of its petroleum, making it dependent on the benecence of countries that possess large amounts of
oil. These countries are shown in Figure The World According to Oil (Figure 8.42), a world map rescaled
with the area of each country proportional to its oil reserves. Middle Eastern countries are among those with
the highest oil reserves. With its economy and standard of living so based on imported petroleum crude it is
easy to see why the United States is deeply involved in Middle East politics. It should be noted that Figure
Peak Oil  The Growing Gap (Figure 8.41) corresponds to the entire world and even currently oil-rich
countries such as Saudi Arabia will soon experience peak oil.

A second major motivation to move away from petroleum crude is global climate change. While the correlation of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere to average global temperature is presently
being debated, the rise of CO2 in our atmosphere that has come from burning fossil fuel since the industrial
revolution is from about 280 ppm to about 390 ppm at present, and cannot be denied. Energy sources such
as wind, solar, nuclear, and biomass are needed that minimize or eliminate the release of atmospheric CO2.
Biomass is included in this list since the carbon that makes up plant ber is taken from the atmosphere in
the process of photosynthesis. Burning fuel derived from biomass releases the CO2 back into the atmosphere,
where it can again be incorporated into plant mass. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of
2007132 denes an advanced biofuel as one that lowers lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (emissions from all
processes involved in obtaining, rening, and nally burning the fuel) by 60% relative to the baseline of 2005
petroleum crude.
8.4.2.2.4 First Generation Biofuels
First generation biofuels are commonly considered to be ethanol, as has been produced in Brazil for over 30
years from sugar cane, and biodiesel produced by breaking down, in a process called transesterication,
vegetable oil. Brazil can eciently harvest the juice from its sugar cane and make ethanol, which is pricecompetitive with gasoline at cost per mile.

Figure 8.43: Gas/Ethanol Fuel Pump A fuel pump in Brazil oering either ethanol alcohol (A) or
gasoline (G). Source: Natecull133
There, if the cost of alcohol (as it is known colloquially) is less than 70% than the cost of gasoline, tanks
are lled with ethanol. If the cost of alcohol is more than 70% of the cost of gasoline, people ll up with
gasoline since there is about a 30% penalty in gas mileage with ethanol. This comes about simply because
the chemical structure of ethanol has less energy per volume (about 76,000 Btu/gallon or 5,100 kcal/liter)
than gasoline (115 Btu/gallon or 7,600 kcal/liter) or diesel (132,000 Btu/gallon or 8,800 kcal/liter). Cane
ethanol qualies, per EISA 2007, as an advanced biofuel.
In the United States, for a cost of about twice that of cane-derived ethanol, corn starch is saccharied
and fermented into ethanol. Ethanol is used predominantly as a high octane, oxygenated blend at 10% to
improve the combustion in gasoline engines. The distribution of ethanol as E85 ex fuel134 (85% ethanol
and 15% gasoline) has faltered probably because the price, even with a 50 cents/gallon federal subsidy, does
not make up for the 25  30% decrease in gas mileage (see Figure Mileage Comparisons (Figure 8.44)).

First generation biodiesel is made via the base catalyzed transesterication of plant oils such as soy
and palm. The main disadvantage with plant oil-based biofuels is the high cost of the plant oil, owing to
the relatively little oil that can be produced per acre of farmland compared to other biofuel sources. The
problem with transesterication is that it produces a fuel relatively high in oxygen, which a) causes the
biodiesel to become cloudy (partially freeze) at relatively high temperature, and makes the biodiesel b) less
stable, and c) less energy dense than petroleum-derived diesel.
Cane ethanol qualies as an advanced biofuel, as its production lowers greenhouse gas emissions more
than 60% relative to the 2005 petroleum baseline (per EISA 2007). Corn ethanol is far from this energy
eciency. However, ethanol made from lignocellulose  the non-food part of plants - comes close, at a 50%
reduction. This brings us to the second generation of biofuels.

374 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
8.4.2.2.5 Second Generation Biofuels
Second generation biofuels are shown in Figure Second Generation Biofuels (Figure 8.45). In anticipation
of the food versus fuel debate, EISA 2007 placed a cap on the production of corn ethanol (at 15 billion
gallons/year, close to what is now produced), with the bulk of biofuels to be derived from agricultural residues
such as corn stover (the parts of the corn plant left over from the ears of corn  the stalk and leaves) and
wheat straw, forest waste (wood trimmings) and energy crops such as switchgrass and short rotation poplar
trees which can be grown on abandoned or marginal farmland with minimal irrigation and fertilization.
A U.S. Department of Agriculture study commissioned in 2005 called the Billion Ton Study136 estimated
that approximately one billion tons per year of biomass could be sustainably produced in the United States
each year; the energy in this biomass equals to the amount of oil we import. If the energy contained in
this biomass can be recovered at an eciency of 50 percent, we can replace half of our imported oil with
domestically produced biofuels.

Collectively termed lignocellulose, this material consists of three main components; cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Chemical or biological pretreatments are required to separate the whole biomasss into
these fractions. Hemicellulose and cellulose, with the appropriate enzymes or inorganic acids, can be deconstructed into simple sugars and the sugars fermented into ethanol, or with some newer strains of microbes,
into butanol. Butanol has only 10% less energy density than gasoline. The lignin fraction of biomass is

375
the most resistant to deconstruction by biological or chemical means and is often burned for heat or power
recovery.
At the same time attention turned toward cellulosic ethanol, petroleum rening companies set about to
improve biodiesel. A petroleum rening process called hydrotreating was used to upgrade plant oil. In this
process, the oil is reacted with hydrogen in the presence of inorganic catalysts, and the plant oil is converted
into a much higher quality, oxygen-free green diesel and jet fuel. This type of biofuel is in fact a drop in
replacement to petroleum-derived diesel and jet fuel and passes all of the stringent regulations demanded by
the automobile and defense industries. It has been tested in a number of commercial and military aircraft.
8.4.2.2.6 Advanced Biofuels
Advanced biofuels are, in fact, characterized by their similarity to present day gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels.
Advanced biofuels are infrastructure compatible and energy dense. The two disadvantages with even
cellulosic ethanol are its low energy density (the energy content of ethanol being independent of whether
it comes from corn, cellulose, etc.) and its incompatibility with existing car engines, oil pipelines, storage
tanks, reneries, etc. For these two reasons the latest research and development eorts in the United States
have been devoted to hydrocarbon biofuels, which have the same gas mileage as the gasoline and diesel fuels
now used, and are completely compatible with the existing oil infrastructure.
Figure 8.46: Routes to Advanced Biofuels Various routes to drop-in replacement hydrocarbon
biofuels. Source: John Regalbuto138
The various routes to drop-in replacement hydrocarbon biofuels are shown in Figure Routes to Advanced Biofuels (Figure 8.46). On the left side of the gure, feedstocks are ordered relative to their
abundance and cost. The most abundant and, therefore, cheapest feedstock is lignocellulose from sources
such as agricultural residue, forest waste, and energy crops such as switch grass and short rotation poplar

trees. Of lesser abundance and higher expense are the sugars and starches  corn and sugar cane. The
least abundant and most expensive biofuels, lipid-based feedstocks from plant oil or animal fat, are shown
at the bottom. Eorts are underway to mass produce oil-laden algae. The oils harvested from algae are
relatively easy to convert to hydrocarbon biofuels, by using processing similar to hydrotreating. The main
set of problems associated with algae lie in its mass production. Algal feedstocks are easy to convert to
hydrocarbons but algae itself is dicult to mass produce, whereas lignocellulose is very abundant but more
dicult to convert into hydrocarbons.
Two of the routes to hydrocarbon biofuels compete directly with fermentation of sugars to ethanol.
The same sugars can be treated with inorganic catalysts, via the blue liquid phase processing routes seen
in the center of Figure Routes to Advanced Biofuels (Figure 8.46), or with microbial routes to yield
hydrocarbons as the fermentation product (pink routes). Microbes are examples of biocatalysts; enzymes
within the microbe act in basically the same way that inorganic catalysts act in inorganic solutions. The
eld of research in which enzymes are engineered to alter biological reaction pathways is called synthetic
biology.
A ow sheet of an inorganic catalytic set of processes to hydrocarbon biofuels, from a leading biofuel
startup company (Virent Energy Systems139 of Madison, Wisconsin) is shown in Figure Inorganic Catalytic Routes to Advanced Biofuels (Figure 8.47). Both of the biocatalytic and the inorganic catalytic
processes involve an intrinsic separation of the hydrocarbon product from water, which eliminates the energy
intensive distillation step needed for alcohol fuels. For the microbial route the added benet of this selfseparation is that the microbes are not poisoned by the accumulation of product as occurs in fermentation
to alcohol.

catalytic set of processes to hydrocarbon biofuels, from a leading biofuel startup company, Virent Energy
Systems. Source: Virent Energy Systems, gure 1140
Two other main routes to hydrocarbon biofuels are seen in the upper section of Figure Routes to
Advanced Biofuels (Figure 8.46): gasication and pyrolysis. An advantage of both of these routes
is that they process whole biomass, including the energy-rich lignin fraction of it. Gasication produces
a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen called synthesis gas, which can be converted to hydrocarbon

fuels by a number of currently commercialized catalytic routes including Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and
methanol-to-gasoline. The challenge with biomass is to make these processes economically viable at small
scale. The second process is pyrolysis, which yields a crude-like intermediate called pyrolysis oil or bio-oil.
This intermediate must be further treated to remove oxygen; once this is done it can be inserted into an
existing petroleum renery for further processing.
8.4.2.2.7 Summary
The motivations for hydrocarbon biofuels are energy independence and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The rst renewable biofuels were biodiesel and bioethanol. With inorganic catalysis and synthetic
biology, these have been supplanted with drop-in replacement gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels. These can be
made in the United States in a number of ways from presently available, sustainably produced lignocellulosic
feedstocks such as corn stover, wood chips, and switchgrass, and in the future, from mass-produced algae.
It is too early to tell which production method will prevail, if in fact one does. Some processes might end up
being particularly advantageous for a particular feedstock such as wood or switchgrass. What we do know
is that something has to be done; our supply of inexpensive, easily accessible oil is running out. Biofuels
will be a big part of the country's long-term energy independence. A great deal of scientic and engineering
research is currently underway; it's an exciting time for biofuels.

8.4.3.1.2 Introduction
With limited supplies of fossil fuels in the coming decades and increasing awareness of environmental concerns
related to combustions of fossil fuels, alternate energy sources such as geothermal are becoming increasingly
attractive. Geothermal energy is energy that comes from the earth. In this section we describe the basic
principles of geothermal energy systems and the energy savings that can result from their use.

378 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
8.4.3.1.3 The Heat Pump
The key to understanding a geothermal energy system is the heat pump. Normally heat goes from a hot area
to a cold area, but a heat pump is a device that enables heat to be transferred from a lower temperature to a
higher temperature with minimal consumption of energy (see Figure A Simple Heat Pump (Figure 8.48)).
A home refrigerator is an example of a simple heat pump. A refrigerator removes heat from the inside of a
refrigerator at approximately 3 ◦C, 38 ◦F (See Heat In in the Figure A Simple Heat Pump (Figure 8.48))
and then discards it to the kitchen (at approximately 27 ◦C, 80 ◦F (See Heat Out in Figure A Simple
Heat Pump (Figure 8.48)). It is pumping heat from the inside of the refrigerator to the outside using a
compressor, hence the name heat pump.
The fact the most uids boil at dierent temperatures when pressure is changed142 is crucial to the
operation of the heat pump. Boiling removes heat from the environment, just like boiling water takes heat
from the stove. In a heat pump, boiling takes place at a lower pressure and, consequently, at a lower
temperature. Let's assume 40 ◦F, or 4 ◦C, so that it can eectively remove heat from the soil or the pond
water (the heat source) in the geothermal unit at 50 ◦F, or 10 ◦C. The steam produced from the boiling can
then be compressed (see Compressor in Figure A Simple Heat Pump (Figure 8.48)) to higher pressure
so that it will condense (the opposite of boiling) at a much higher temperature. When a geothermal unit is
incorporated into a building, it is the building that removes the heat, subsequently warming it up (See Heat
Out in Figure A Simple Heat Pump (Figure 8.48)). The condensed steam in a geothermal heat pump
will thus provide heat at a much higher temperature to the area being heated than the original heat source.
Finally a throttle, similar to a water faucet at home, is used to lower the pressure (See Expansion Valve in
Figure A Simple Heat Pump (Figure 8.48)) to complete the closed system cycle, which is then repeated.
By switching the direction of the heat pump, the geothermal system can be used for cooling as well.
142This is the same reason why water boils at lower temperatures at higher elevations where pressure is lower, for example in
Boulder, Colorado.

8.4.3.1.4 Geothermal Heating and Cooling
Geothermal systems are suited to locations with somewhat extreme temperature ranges. Areas with moderate
temperature ranges (e.g. some areas of California) can use ordinary heat pumps with similar energy savings
by adding or removing heat to/from the outside air directly. Areas that experience somewhat extreme
temperatures (e.g. the Midwest and East Coast) are ideal target locations for geothermal systems. For
regions with moderate climates, such as many parts of the South or the West Coast, conventional heat
pumps, that exchange energy generally with the outside air, can still be used with similar energy savings.
Geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) use the almost constant temperatures (7 ◦C to 8 ◦C, or 45 ◦F to 48 ◦F) of
soil beneath the frost line as an energy source to provide ecient heating and cooling all year long. The
installation cost of GHPs is higher than conventional systems due to additional drilling and excavation
expenses, but the added cost is quickly oset by GHPs' higher eciency. It is possible to gain up to 50

percent savings over conventional heating and cooling systems (see Figure Estimated Cooling Costs
Comparison (Figure 8.49)), which allows the additional capital costs from installation to be recovered, on
average, in less than 5 years. GHP's have an average lifespan of over 30 years, leaving 25 years or more of
heating/cooling savings for those willing to make the investment. In addition, GHPs are space ecient and,
because they contain fewer moving components, they also have lower maintenance costs.

8.4.3.1.5 Types of Geothermal Systems
There are two major types of geothermal systems: in ground and pond systems. In ground geothermal
systems can be vertical and horizontal as shown in Figure In Ground Geothermal Systems (Figure 8.50).
The excavation cost of vertical systems is generally higher and they require more land area for installation,
which is generally not an option in urban locations. Other than excavation costs, vertical and horizontal
GHPs have similar eciencies since the ground temperature below the frost line is essentially constant.

Pond geothermal systems are generally preferable if there is water available in the vicinity at almost
constant temperature year round. These systems are especially suited to industrial units (e.g. oil reneries)
with water treatment facilities to treat processed water before it is discharged. The temperature of treated
water from these facilities is essentially constant throughout the year and is an ideal location for a pond
system. Pond geothermal systems are constructed with either open loops or closed loops (see Figure Pond
Geothermal Systems (Figure 8.51)). Open loop systems actually remove water from the pond, while the
close loop systems only remove energy in the form of heat from the pond water. Of course, in open pond
system this water is again returned to the pond, albeit at a lower temperature when used for heating.

8.4.3.1.6 Economics of Geothermal Systems
As stated earlier, depending upon the type of system, the capital and installation cost of a geothermal
system is about twice the cost of a traditional heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) system.
However, both the operating and maintenance costs are much lower and switching from heating to cooling is
eortless. A typical return of investment (ROI) plot for a ground geothermal system for a multi-unit building
is favorable (see Figure Return of Investment in Geothermal System (Figure 8.52)). A geothermal
system that had an additional $500,000 in capital costs but lower operating and maintenance costs allowed
the added cost to be recouped in 5 to 8 years. Since the average lifespan of a geothermal system is at least
30 years, the savings over the lifetime of the system can be substantial. The eciency of ground geothermal
systems is fairly constant since there are no large variations in ground temperature. The eciency for
pond systems would, in general, be much higher than those shown in Figure Return of Investment in
Geothermal System (Figure 8.52) if, during the winter months, the pond water temperature is higher
than typical ground temperatures below the frost line (7 ◦
C - 8 ◦
C, or 44 ◦
F - 48 ◦
F) because the eciency
of heat pumps increases with higher heat source temperature. Another reason for higher eciency of pond
systems is the much higher heat transfer rate between a uid and the outer surface of the geothermal pipes,
especially if the water is owing.

8.4.3.1.7 Increasing Eciency of Geothermal Systems
Several strategies are available to increase the eciency of geothermal systems. One of the most promising
possibilities is to use it in conjunction with phase change materials (PCM) (see also Module Applications of Phase Change Materials for Sustainable Energy (Section 8.6)), particularly to handle peak
loads of energy consumptions. Phase change materials are materials that can absorb and deliver much larger
amounts of energy compared to typical building materials. The cost of geothermal systems unlike other
HVAC systems increases almost linearly with system size (approximately $1000/ton). Thus, building larger
systems to account for peak loads can signicantly add to both the capital and installation costs. PCM can
be incorporated into all four geothermal systems described earlier. The best approach is to incorporate PCMs
with geothermal systems for applications in systems with non-uniform energy requirements, or systems with
short but signicant swings and peaks in energy needs. For example, designers may include snow melting
heating systems for train platforms or they may build a buer energy reservoir using PCMs to satisfy peak
needs of cooling on a hot summer afternoon. The advantages in the former application would be to avoid
running the geothermal system for heat loads at low temperatures over prolonged periods, which would not
be as energy ecient and would require specially designed systems.
Using phase change materials allows for the use of standard geothermal systems, which would then store
energy in a PCM unit to supply heat at a constant temperature and at a uniform heat rate to, for example,
melt the snow on train platforms. Once the energy in the PCM is nearly used the geothermal system would

384 CHAPTER 8. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS
repower the PCM storage. The extra energy needs for peak periods could be stored in PCM Storage Tanks
and then used to address such needs. For example, on a hot summer day, the PCM unit can be used to
remove additional heat above the designed capacity of the geothermal system during temperature spikes,
which generally last only a few hours. This then reduces the load on the geothermal system during peak
hours when electricity cost is generally the highest.
PCM Storage Tanks reduce the overall cost of the geothermal heat pump system signicantly since it
does not have to be designed to address peak heating/cooling needs. In addition, it also shifts energy loads
from peak hours to non-peak hours. Figure Temperature Variation (Figure 8.53) shows temperature
variations for a typical summer day in July 2010 in Chicago. The high temperature of 90 degree lasted only
for a short period of about 4 hours, and then returned to below 85 degrees rapidly. These relatively short
temperature peaks can be easily managed by PCMs.

In conclusion, geothermal heat pumps are a very attractive, cost ecient sustainable energy source for
both heating and cooling with a minimal carbon print. It is a well-developed technology that can be easily
incorporated into both residential and commercial buildings at either the design stage or by retrotting
buildings.

8.5 Energy Uses
8.5.1 Electric and Plug-in Hybrids150
8.5.1.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• outline the traditional dependence of transportation on oil and the internal combustion engine
• understand two alternatives to oil as a transportation fuel: hydrogen and electricity
• understand the dual use of oil and electricity in hybrid vehicles and their impact on energy eciency
and carbon emissions
8.5.1.2 Introduction
Since the early 20th Century, oil and the internal combustion engine have dominated transportation.
The fortunes of oil and vehicles have been intertwined, with oil racing to meet the energy demands of the ever
growing power and number of personal vehicles, vehicles driving farther in response to growing interstate
highway opportunities for long distance personal travel and freight shipping, and greater personal mobility
producing living patterns in far-ung suburbs that require oil and cars to function. In recent and future
years, the greatest transportation growth will be in developing countries where the need and the market
for transportation is growing rapidly. China has an emerging middle class that is larger than the entire
population of the United States, a sign that developing countries will soon direct or strongly inuence the
emergence of new technologies designed to serve their needs. Beyond deploying new technologies, developing
countries have a potentially large second advantage: they need not follow the same development path through
outdated intermediate technologies taken by the developed world. Leapfrogging directly to the most advanced
technologies avoids legacy infrastructures and long turnover times, allowing innovation and deployment on
an accelerated scale.
The internal combustion engine and the vehicles it powers have made enormous engineering strides in
the past half century, increasing eciency, durability, comfort and adding such now-standard features as air
conditioning, cruise control, hands-free cell phone use, and global positioning systems. Simultaneously, the
automobile industry has become global, dramatically increasing competition, consumer choice and marketing
reach. The most recent trend in transportation is dramatic swings in the price of oil, the lifeblood of
traditional vehicles powered with internal combustion engines.
8.5.1.3 Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel
The traditional synergy of oil with automobiles may now be showing signs of strain. The reliance of vehicles on
one fuel whose price shows strong uctuations and whose future course is ultimately unsustainable presents
long-term business challenges. Motivated by these business and sustainability concerns, the automobile
industry is beginning to diversify to other fuels. Hydrogen made its debut in the early 2000s, and showed
that it has the potential to power vehicles using fuel cells to produce on-board electricity for electric motors
(Eberle and von Helmholt, 2010 (p. 390), Crabtree, Dresselhaus, & Buchanan, 2004 (p. 390)). One
advantage of hydrogen is eciency, up to 50 percent or greater for fuel cells, up to 90 percent or greater for
electric motors powering the car, compared with 25 percent eciency for an internal combustion engine. A

second advantage is reduced dependence on foreign oil  hydrogen can be produced from natural gas or from
entirely renewable resources such as solar decomposition of water. A third potential advantage of hydrogen
is environmental  the emissions from the hydrogen car are harmless: water and a small amount of heat,
though the emissions from the hydrogen production chain may signicantly oset this advantage.
The vision of hydrogen cars powered by fuel cells remains strong. It must overcome signicant challenges,
however, before becoming practical, such as storing hydrogen on board vehicles at high densities, nding
inexpensive and earth-abundant catalysts to promote the reduction of oxygen to water in fuel cells, and
producing enough hydrogen from renewable sources such as solar driven water splitting to fuel the automobile
industry (Crabtree & Dresselhaus, 2008 (p. 390)). The hydrogen and electric energy chains for automobiles
are illustrated in Figure Electric Transportation (Figure 8.54). Many scientists and automobile companies
are exploring hydrogen as a long-term alternative to oil.
Figure 8.54: Electric Transportation Transportation is electried by replacing the gasoline engine
with an electric motor, powered by electricity from a battery on board the car (upper panel) or electricity
from a fuel cell and hydrogen storage system on board the car (lower panel). For maximum eectiveness,
both routes require renewable production of electricity or hydrogen. Source: George Crabtree151 using

8.5.1.4 Electricity as an Alternative Fuel
Electric cars represent a second alternative to oil for transportation, with many similarities to hydrogen (see
Figure Electric Transportation (Figure 8.54)). Electric vehicles are run by an electric motor, as in a fuel
cell car, up to four times as ecient as a gasoline engine. The electric motor is far simpler than a gasoline
engine, having only one moving part, a shaft rotating inside a stationary housing and surrounded by a coil
of copper wire. Electricity comes from a battery, whose storage capacity, like that of hydrogen materials,
is too small to enable long distance driving. Developing higher energy density batteries for vehicles is a

major challenge for the electric car industry. The battery must be charged before driving, which can be done
from the grid using excess capacity available at night, or during the day from special solar charging stations
that do not add additional load to the grid. Because charging typically takes hours, a potentially attractive
alternative is switching the battery out in a matter of minutes for a freshly charged one at special swapping
stations. A large eet of electric cars in the United States would require signicant additional electricity, as
much as 130 GW if the entire passenger and light truck eet were converted to electricity, or 30 percent of
average United States electricity usage in 2008.
The energy usage of electric cars is about a factor of four less than for gasoline cars, consistent with the
higher eciency of electric motors over internal combustion engines. Although gasoline cars vary signicantly
in their energy eciency, a "typical" middle of the road value for a ve-passenger car is 80kWh/100km. A
typical electric car (such as the Think Ox from Norway, the Chevy Volt operating in its electric mode, or
the Nissan Leaf) uses ∼ 20 kWh/100km. While the energy cost of electric cars at the point of use is
signicantly less, one must consider the cost at the point of production, the electricity generating plant.
If the vehicle's electricity comes from coal with a conversion eciency of 33 percent, the primary energy cost
is 60 kWh/100km, approaching but still smaller than that of the gasoline car. If electricity is generated by
combined cycle natural gas turbines with 60 percent eciency, the primary energy cost is 33 kWh/100km, less
than half the primary energy cost for gasoline cars. These comparisons are presented in Table Comparisons
of Energy Use (Table 8.2: Comparisons of Energy Use).

The carbon footprint of electric cars requires a similar calculation. For coal-red electricity producing 2.1
lb CO2/kWh, driving 100km produces 42 lbs (19 kgs) of carbon dioxide; for gas-red electricity producing
1.3 lb CO2/kWh, 100km of driving produces 26 lbs (11.7 kgs) of carbon dioxide. If electricity is produced
by nuclear or renewable energy such as wind, solar or hydroelectric, no carbon dioxide is produced. For
a "typical" gasoline car, 100km of driving produces 41 lbs (18.5 kgs) of carbon dioxide. Thus the carbon
footprint of a "typical" electric car is, at worst equal, to that of a gasoline car and, at best, zero. Table
Comparisons of Carbon Emissions (Table 8.3: Comparisons of Carbon Emissions) summarizes the carbon
footprint comparisons.
8.5.1.5 The Hybrid Solutions
Unlike electric cars, hybrid vehicles rely only on gasoline for their power. Hybrids do, however, have a
supplemental electric motor and drive system that operates only when the gasoline engine performance is
weak or needs a boost: on starting from a stop, passing, or climbing hills. Conventional gasoline cars have
only a single engine that must propel the car under all conditions; it must, therefore, be sized to the largest
task. Under normal driving conditions the engine is larger and less ecient than it needs to be. The hybrid
solves this dilemma by providing two drive trains, a gasoline engine for normal driving and an electric motor
for high power needs when starting, climbing hills and passing. The engine and motor are tailored to their
respective tasks, enabling each to be designed for maximum eciency. As the electric motor is overall much
more ecient, its use can raise fuel economy signicantly.
The battery in hybrid cars has two functions: it drives the electric motor and also collects electrical energy
from regenerative braking, converted from kinetic energy at the wheels by small generators. Regenerative
braking is eective in start-stop driving, increasing eciency up to 20 percent. Unlike gasoline engines,
electric motors use no energy while standing still; hybrids therefore shut o the gasoline engine when the car
comes to a stop to save the idling energy. Gasoline engines are notoriously inecient at low speeds (hence
the need for low gear ratios), so the electric motor accelerates the hybrid to ∼15 mph (24 kph) before the
gasoline engine restarts. Shutting the gasoline engine o while stopped increases eciency as much as 17
percent.
The energy saving features of hybrids typically lower their energy requirements from 80 kWh/100km to
50-60 kWh/100km, a signicant savings. It is important to note, however, that despite a supplementary
electric motor drive system, all of a hybrid's energy comes from gasoline and none from the electricity grid.
The plug-in hybrid diers from conventional hybrids in tapping both gasoline and the electricity grid
for its energy. Most plug-in hybrids are designed to run on electricity rst and on gasoline second; the
gasoline engine kicks in only when the battery runs out. The plug-in hybrid is thus an electric car with a
supplemental gasoline engine, the opposite of the conventional hybrid cars described above. The value of
the plug-in hybrid is that it solves the "driving range anxiety" of the consumer: there are no worries about
getting home safely from a trip that turns out to be longer than expected. The disadvantage of the plug-in
hybrid is the additional supplemental gasoline engine technology, which adds cost and complexity to the
automobile.

389
8.5.1.6 The Battery Challenge
To achieve reasonable driving range, electric cars and plug-in hybrids need large batteries, one of their greatest
design challenges and a potentially signicant consumer barrier to widespread sales. Even with the largest
practical batteries, driving range on electricity is limited, perhaps to ∼100km. Designing higher energy
density batteries is currently a major focus of energy research, with advances in Li-ion battery technology
expected to bring signicant improvements. The second potential barrier to public acceptance of electric
vehicles is charging time, up to eight hours from a standard household outlet. This may suit overnight
charging at home, but could be a problem for trips beyond the battery's range  with a gasoline car the
driver simply lls up in a few minutes and is on his way. Novel infrastructure solutions such as battery
swapping stations for long trips are under consideration.
From a sustainability perspective, the comparison of gasoline, electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars is
interesting. Hybrid cars take all their energy from gasoline and represent the least dierence from gasoline
cars. Their supplementary electric drive systems reduce gasoline usage by 30-40 percent, thus promoting
conservation of a nite resource and reducing reliance on foreign oil. Electric cars, however, get all of their
energy from grid electricity, a domestic energy source, completely eliminating reliance on foreign oil and use
of nite oil resources. Their sustainability value is therefore higher than hybrids. Plug-in hybrids have the
same potential as all electric vehicles, provided their gasoline engines are used sparingly. In terms of carbon
emissions, the sustainability value of electric vehicles depends entirely on the electricity source: neutral for
coal, positive for gas and highly positive for nuclear or renewable hydro, wind or solar. From an energy
perspective, electric cars use a factor of four less energy than gasoline cars at the point of use, but this
advantage is partially compromised by ineciencies at the point of electricity generation. Even inecient
coal-red electricity leaves an advantage for electric cars, and ecient gas-red combined cycle electricity
leaves electric cars more than a factor of two more energy ecient than gasoline cars.
8.5.1.7 Summary
Electricity oers an attractive alternative to oil as a transportation fuel: it is domestically produced, uses
energy more eciently, and, depending on the mode of electricity generation, can emit much less carbon.
Electric vehicles can be powered by fuel cells producing electricity from hydrogen, or from batteries charged
from the electricity grid. The hydrogen option presents greater technological challenges of fuel cell cost and
durability and high capacity on-board hydrogen storage. The battery option is ready for implementation in
the nearer term but requires higher energy density batteries for extended driving range, and a fast charging
or battery swapping alternative to long battery charging times.
8.5.1.8 Review Questions
Question 8.5.1.1
Transportation relies almost exclusively for its fuel on oil, whose price uctuates signicantly in
response to global geopolitics and whose long-term availability is limited. What are the motivations
for each of the stakeholders, including citizens, companies and governments, to nd alternatives to
oil as a transportation fuel?
Question 8.5.1.2
Electricity can replace oil as a transportation fuel in two ways: by on board production in a hydrogen fuel cell, and by on board storage in a battery. What research and development, infrastructure
and production challenges must be overcome for each of these electrication options to be widely
deployed?

8.5.2 Combined Heat and Power160
8.5.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• dene combined heat and power (CHP) as an alternative energy source
• provide CHP component characteristics and operational benets
• outline the characteristics of good CHP applications
8.5.2.2 Introduction
Electricity in the United States is generated, for the most part, from central station power plants at a
conversion eciency of roughly 30 to 35 percent. Meaning, for every 100 units of fuel energy into a simple
cycle central station electric power plant, we get only 30 to 35 units of electricity. The remainder of the
energy in the fuel is lost to the atmosphere in the form of heat.
The thermal requirements of our buildings and facilities are generally provided on-site through the use
of a boiler or furnace. The eciencies of this equipment have improved over the years and now it is common
to have boilers and furnaces in commercial and industrial facilities with eciencies of 80 percent and higher.
Meaning, for every 100 units of fuel energy into the boiler/furnace, we get about 80 units of useful thermal
energy.
Commercial and industrial facilities that utilize the conventional energy system found in the United
States (electricity supplied from the electric grid and thermal energy produced on-site through the use of
a boiler/furnace) will often times experience overall fuel eciencies of between 40 to 55 percent (actual
eciency depends on the facilities heat to power ratio).
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is a form of distributed generation. It is an integrated system
located at or near the building/facility that generates utility grade electricity which satises at least a portion
of the electrical load of the facility, and captures and recycles the waste heat from the electric generating
equipment to provide useful thermal energy to the facility.

Conventional CHP (also referred to as topping cycle CHP) utilizes a single dedicated fuel source to
sequentially produce useful electric and thermal power. Figure Conventional (Topping Cycle) CHP (p.
391) provides a diagram of a typical topping cycle CHP system. A variety of fossil fuels, renewable fuels,
and waste products are utilized as input fuel to power a prime mover that generates mechanical shaft
power (exception is fuel cells). Prime movers might include reciprocating engines, gas turbines, steam
turbines or fuel cells. The mechanical shaft power is converted into utility grade electricity through a
highly ecient generator. Since the CHP system is located at or near the building/facility, the heat lost
through the prime mover can be recycled through a heat exchanger and provide heating, cooling (absorption
chillers), and/or dehumidication (desiccants) to meet the thermal load of the building. These systems
can reach fuel use eciencies of as high as 75 to 85 percent (versus the conventional energy system at
approximately 40 to 55 percent).
Figure 8.55: Conventional (Topping Cycle) CHP Diagram illustrates a typical topping cycle of
CHP systems. Source: John Cuttica161
In our example of 100 units of fuel into the CHP system, only 30 to 35 units of electricity are generated,
but another 40 to 50 units of the fuels energy can be recovered and utilized to produce thermal power. What
this tells us is that for conventional CHP systems to reach the high eciency level, there must be a use for
the recovered thermal energy. Thus a key factor for conventional CHP systems is the coincidence of electric
and thermal loads in the building. This is shown in Figure Importance of Waste Heat Recovery (p. 391).
The Y axis represents the cost of generating electricity with a CHP system utilizing a 32 percent ecient
reciprocating engine. The X axis represents the cost of natural gas utilized to operate the CHP system and
also the value of the natural gas being displaced if the recycled heat from the engine can be utilized. The
lines in the chart show various levels of recoverable heat available from the engine. If no heat is recovered (no
use for the thermal energy), the cost of generating electricity with the CHP system is $0.08/kWhr. When
the full amount of heat from the engine is recovered (full use of the thermal energy), the cost of generating
electricity with the CHP system then drops to $0.03/kWhr.

Figure 8.56: Importance of Waste Heat Recovery Graph shows the importance of waste heat
recovery in CHP systems. Source: John Cuttica162
Since the high eciency of a CHP system is dependent on the eective use of the recoverable heat, CHP
systems are often times sized to meet the thermal load of the application and the amount of electricity
produced is the by-product. The electricity is used to o set the electricity otherwise purchased from the
local electric utility. When the CHP system does not produce enough electricity to satisfy the load, the utility
supplies the dierence from the grid. When the CHP system (sized from the thermal requirements) produces
more electricity than the load requires, the excess electricity can be sold to the local utility (normally at the
avoided cost of power to the utility).
There are three general modes of operation for CHP on-site generators relative to the electric utility grid:
• Stand Alone (totally isolated from the grid)
• Isolated from the grid with utility back-up (when needed)
• Parallel operation with the grid
The preferred mode of operation is parallel with the grid. Both the on-site CHP system and the utility
grid power the facility simultaneously. With a proper sizing and conguration of the CHP system, the
parallel mode of operation provides the most exibility. Should the grid go down, the CHP system can keep
operating (e.g. during the 2003 Northeast Blackout163 and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina164 ), and should the
CHP system go down, the utility grid can supply power to the load. Overall reliability of power to the load
is increased.
The basic components of a conventional (topping cycle) CHP system are:

· Reciprocating engine
· Turbines (gas, micro, steam)
· Fuel Cell (fuel cells ustilize an electrochemical process rather than a mechanical shaft process)
• Generator converts the mechanical shaft energy into electrical energy
· Synchronous generator (provides most exibility and independence from the grid)
· Induction generator (grid goes down  the CHP system stops operating)
· Inverter (used mainly on fuel cells  converts DC power to utility grade AC power)
• Waste Heat Recovery is one or more heat exchangers that capture and recycle the heat from the prime
mover
• Thermal Utilization equipment converts the recycled heat into useful heating, cooling (absorption
chillers) and/or dehumidication (deisiccant dehumidiers)
• Operating Control Systems insure the CHP components function properly together
8.5.2.3 Reducing CO2 Emissions
In 2007, McKinsey & Company165 published a study166 on reducing United States greenhouse gas emissions.
The report analyzed the cost and potential impact of over 250 technology options regarding contribution to
reducing CO2 emissions. Two conclusions stated in the report were:
• Abatement opportunities are highly fragmented and spread across the economy.
• Almost 40 percent of abatement could be achieved at negative marginal costs.
Figure Cost of CO (Figure 8.57)2 Reduction Technologies (Figure 8.57) emphasizes both of these points. It
is interesting to point out that CHP (both industrial and commercial applications), when sized and installed
appropriately, delivers CO2 reductions at a negative marginal cost. All the technologies that show a negative
marginal cost on the chart generate positive economic returns over the technology's life cycle. The gure
also shows that in terms of cost eectiveness of the wide range of abatement technologies, energy eciency
measures are by far more eective than renewable, nuclear and clean coal generating technologies. CHP
technologies stand out as having negative marginal costs and overall positive cost eectiveness comparable
to most of the energy eciency measures.

8.5.2.4 CHP Applications
Today there are more than 3,500 CHP installations in the United States, totaling more than 85,000 MW
of electric generation. That represents approximately 9 percent of the total electric generation capacity in
the United States. The 85,000 MW of installed CHP reduces energy consumption by 1.9 Quads (1015 Btus)
annually and eliminates approximately 248 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2 annually.
CHP systems are generally more attractive for applications that have one or more of the following
characteristics:
• Good coincidence between electric and thermal loads
• Maximum cost dierential between electricity cost from the local utility and the cost of the fuel utilized
in the CHP system (referred to as spark spread)
• Long operating hours (normally more than 3,000 hours annually)
• Need for good power quality and reliability
The following are just a few of the type applications where CHP makes sense:
• Hospitals
• Colleges and Universities
• High Schools
• Fitness Centers
• Oce Buildings
• Hotels

8.5.2.5 CHP Benets
CHP is not the only solution to our energy problems. In fact, CHP is not the most cost eective solution
in all applications or in all areas of the country. There are many variables that determine the viability of
CHP installations. However, when the technical and nancial requirements of the application are met, a well
designed, installed and operated CHP system provides benets for the facility owner (end user), the electric
utility, and society in general. The high eciency attained by the CHP system provides the end user with
lower overall energy costs, improved electric reliability, improved electric power quality, and improved energy
security. In areas where the electric utility distribution grid is in need of expansion and/or upgrades, CHP
systems can provide the electric utility with a means of deferring costly modications to the grid. Although
the electricity generated on-site by the end user displaces the electricity purchased from the local electric
utility and is seen as lost revenue by many utilities, energy eciency and lower utility costs are in the best
interest of the utility customer and should be considered as a reasonable customer option by forward-looking
customer oriented utilities. Finally, society in general benets from the high eciencies realized by CHP
systems. The high eciencies translate to less air pollutants (lower greenhouse gas and NOx emissions) than
produced from central station electric power plants.
8.5.2.6 Waste Heat to Power
There is a second type of CHP system, referred to as Waste Heat to Power (Bottoming Cycle CHP).
Unlike conventional CHP where a dedicated fuel is combusted in a prime mover, Waste Heat to Power CHP
systems captures the heat otherwise wasted in an industrial or commercial process. The waste heat, rather
than the process fuel, becomes the fuel source for the waste heat to power system. It is used to generate
steam or hot water, which in turn is utilized to drive a steam turbine or (for lower temperatures) an organic
rankine cycle heat engine. In this case, the waste heat from the industrial/commercial process is converted
to electric power. Figure Waste Heat to Power (Bottoming Cycle) CHP (Figure 8.58) provides a diagram
of a Waste Heat to Power CHP system.

8.5.2.7 Summary
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) represents a proven and eective near-term alternative energy option that
can enhance energy eciency, ensure environmental quality, and promote economic growth. The concept
of generating electricity on-site allows one to capture and recycle the waste heat from the prime mover
providing fuel use eciencies as high as 75 to 85 percent. Like other forms of alternative energy, CHP should
be considered and included in any portfolio of energy options.

8.6 Applications of Phase Change Materials for Sustainable Energy172
8.6.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• learn the general concept of Phase Change Materials (PCM)
• understand the applications of PCMs in sustainable energy
• recognize the uses of PCM for heating and cooling systems
• recognize the uses of PCM in buildings
• recognize the uses of PCM in transportation
8.6.2 Introduction
The growing demand for sustainable energy from consumers and industry is constantly changing. The
highest demand of energy consumption during a single day brings a continuous and unsolved problem: how
to maintain a consistent desired temperature in a sustainable way. Periods of extreme cold or warm weather
are the triggering factors for increasing the demand on heating or cooling. Working hours, industry processes,
building construction, operating policies, and type and volume of energy production facilities are some of
the main reasons for peak demand crises. Better power generation management and signicant economic
benet can be achieved if some of the peak load could be shifted to the o peak load period. This can be
achieved by thermal storage for space heating and cooling purposes.
Thermal energy can be stored as a change in the internal energy of certain materials as sensible heat,
latent heat or both. The most commonly used method of thermal energy storage is the sensible heat
method, although phase change materials (PCM), which eectively store and release latent heat energy,
have been studied for more than 30 years. Latent heat storage can be more ecient than sensible heat
storage because it requires a smaller temperature dierence between the storage and releasing functions.
Phase change materials are an important and underused option for developing new energy storage devices,
which are as important as developing new sources of renewable energy. The use of phase change material in
developing and constructing sustainable energy systems is crucial to the eciency of these systems because
of PCM's ability to harness heat and cooling energies in an eective and sustainable way.
8.6.3 Phase Change Materials for Energy Storage Devices
Thermal storage based on sensible heat works on the temperature rise on absorbing energy or heat, as shown
in the solid and liquid phases in Figure Temperature Prole of a PCM (p. 398). When the stored
heat is released, the temperature falls, providing two points of dierent temperature that dene the storage
and release functions. Phase change materials are conceptually dierent, however. They operate by storing

energy at a constant temperature while phase change occurs, for example from solid to a liquid, as illustrated
in the center of Figure Temperature Prole of a PCM (p. 398). As heat is added to the material, the
temperature does not rise; instead heat drives the change to a higher energy phase. The liquid, for example,
has kinetic energy of the motion of atoms that is not present in the solid, so its energy is higher. The higher
energy of the liquid compared to the solid is the latent heat. When the solid is fully transformed to liquid,
added energy reverts to going into sensible heat and raising the temperature of the liquid.
Figure 8.59: Temperature Prole of a PCM. Figure shows the temperature prole of a PCM.
In the region where latent heat is eective, the temperature keeps either constant or in a narrow range.
The phase of the material turns from one to another and both phases appears in the medium. Source:
Said Al-Hallaj173 & Riza Kizilel174
A PCM is a substance with a high latent heat (also called the heat of fusion if the phase change is from
solid to liquid) which is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy at a certain temperature.
A PCM stores heat in the form of latent heat of fusion which is about 100 times more than the sensible
heat. For example, latent heat of fusion of water is about 334kJ/kg whereas sensible heat at 25 ◦ Celsius
(77 ◦F) is about 4.18kJ/kg. PCM will then release thermal energy at a freezing point during solidication
process (Figure Phase Change of a PCM (p. 399)). Two widely used PCMs by many of us are water
and wax. Think how water requires signicant amount of energy when it changes from solid phase to liquid

phase at 0 ◦C (32 ◦F) or how wax extends the burning time of a candle. Moreover, the cycle of the melting
and solidication can be repeated many times.
Figure 8.60: Phase Change of a PCM. Figure represents the phase change of a PCM when the
heat is applied or removed. Source: Said Al-Hallaj175 & Riza Kizilel176
There are large numbers of PCMs that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them
attractive in a number of applications in the development of the energy storage systems. Materials that have
been studied during the last 40 years include hydrated salts, paran waxes, fatty acids and eutectics of
organic and non-organic compounds (Figure Energy Storage Systems (p. 399)). Therefore, the selection
of a PCM with a suitable phase transition temperature should be part of the design of a thermal storage
system. It should be good at heat transfer and have high latent heat of transition. The melting temperature
should lie in the range of the operation, be chemically stable, low in cost, non-corrosive and nontoxic.

Riza Kizilel178
Even though the list of the PCMs is quite long, only a limited number of the chemicals are possible
candidates for energy applications due to the various limitations of the processes. Parans and hydrated
salts are the two most promising PCMs. Generally, parans have lower fusion energy than salt hydrates
but do not have the reversibility issue, i.e paran is only in physical changes and keeps its composition
when heat is released or gained whereas hydrated salt is in chemical change when heat is released or gained.
Therefore, a major problem with salt hydrates is incongruent melting, which reduces the reversibility of the
phase change process. This also results in a reduction of the heat storage capacity of the salt hydrate. On the
other hand, parans also have a major drawback compared to salt hydrates. The low thermal conductivity
creates a major drawback which decreases the rates of heat stored and released during the melting and
crystallization processes and hence results in limited applications. The thermal conductivity of paran used
as PCM is slightly above 0.20 W/mK (compare with ice; kice=∼2 W/mK). Several methods such as nned
tubes with dierent congurations and metal matrices lled with PCM have been investigated to enhance
the heat transfer rate of PCM. Novel composite materials of PCM, which have superior properties, have also
been proposed for various applications. For example, when PCM is embedded inside a graphite matrix,
the heat conductivity can be considerably increased without much reduction in energy storage.

8.6.4 Applications of PCMs
The three applications of PCMs listed below (solar energy, buildings, and vehicles) are only a small portion
of the many areas where they can be used (catering, telecom shelters, electronics, etc.). The applications of
PCMs in these areas have been widely studied in order to minimize the greenhouse eect and to minimize
the need for foreign gasoline which costs U.S. economy millions of dollars every year.
Increasing concerns of the impact of fossil fuels on the environment and their increasing cost has led to
studies on thermal energy storage for the space heating and cooling of buildings. Extreme cold or warm
weather increases the demand on heating or cooling. If the thermal energy of heat or coolness is stored and
then provided during the day or night, part of the peak loads can be shifted to o-peak hours. Therefore,
an eective energy management and economic benet can be achieved.
Solar energy is recognized as one of the most promising alternative energy resource options. However,
it is intermittent by nature: there is no sun at night. The reliability of solar energy can be increased by
storing it when in excess of the load and using the stored energy whenever needed.
The minimization of heat loss or gain through walls, ceilings, and oors has been studied for a long time
and PCM applications have been considered for more than 30 years to minimize these losses/gains, and
thus reduce the cost of electricity or natural gas use in buildings. Studies on viability of PCMs in vehicle
applications are also growing widely. Denaturation of food during transport brings a major problem which
is being partially solved by refrigerated trucks. However, this causes not only more expensive foods, but also
irreversible environmental eects on living organisms.
8.6.4.1 Solar Energy Applications
Solar thermal energy is a technology for harnessing solar energy for thermal energy. The solar energy is
absorbed by the earth and is dissipated throughout the ground at dierent rates that is dependent on the
compositions of the ground and amount of water. Ground temperature is stable and solar energy can be
transferred between the ground and space heating/cooling places. Water heaters that use solar energy play
an important role for this purpose and they started to become popular in the late 1960s (Figure Solar
Heater (p. 401)). In order to utilize the energy from the sun at all times, this precious energy should
be stored and used when needed. Passive systems using PCMs have been good candidates for thermal
energy storage and have been applied since 1980s. At rst, the water heaters were supported by lling the
bottom of the heaters with PCMs, which was a rst step in storing energy in heating systems. However, the
quantity of the available energy in the storage system was limited by low thermal conductivity of the PCM.
Improvements on thermal storage systems and developments in the incorporation of PCMs that utilize the
solar energy have been extensively studied since then.

Figure 8.62: Solar Heater. Figure shows solar heating system with and without PCM. Source: Said
Al-Hallaj179 & Riza Kizilel180
Later studies have mainly concentrated on increasing thermal conductivity using composite materials.
Adding PCM modules at the top of the water tank gives the system a higher storage density and compensate
for heat loss in the top layer because of the latent heat of PCM. The conguration of the PCM storage
unit can result in advantageous control of the water temperature rise and drop during both day and night
time. Therefore, thermally stratied water tanks are widely used for short term thermal energy storage.
Application of these tanks signicantly increases not only the energy density with the number of PCM
modules, but also the cooling period and keeps the water temperature higher compared to the ones without
PCMs. Besides, solar water heating systems operate within a wide range of temperatures from ambient
temperatures to 80 ◦C (176 ◦F). A PCM has much larger heat storage capacity relative to water over a
narrow temperature range, close to its melting temperature.
A major component of total household energy consumption is cooking. Solar energy oers an economical
option for cooking in households, especially in third world countries. A solar cooker is a device which uses
the energy of sunlight to heat food or drink to cook or sterilize it (Figure Solar Cooker (p. 402)). It uses no
fuel, costs nothing to operate, and reduces air pollution. A solar cooker's reective surface concentrates the
light into a small cooking area and turns the light into heat. It is important to trap the heat in the cooker
because heat may be easily lost by convection and radiation. The feasibility of using a phase change material
as the storage medium in solar cookers have been examined since 1995. A box-type solar cooker with stearic
acid based PCM has been designed and fabricated by Buddhi and Sahoo (1997) (p. 407), showing that it is
possible to cook food even in the evening with a solar cooker. The rate of heat transfer from the PCM to
the cooking pot during the discharging mode of the PCM is quite slow and more time is required for cooking
food in the evening. Fins that are welded at the inner wall of the PCM container were used to enhance the
rate of heat transfer between the PCM and the inner wall of the PCM container. Since the PCM surrounds
the cooking vessel, the rate of heat transfer between the PCM and the food is higher and the cooking time
is shorter. It is remarkable that if food is loaded into the solar cooker before 3:30 p.m. during the winter
season, it could be cooked. However, the melting temperature of the PCM should be selected carefully. The
more the input solar radiation, the larger quantity of heat there is in a PCM. Few examples for PCMs for
solar cooker applications are acetamide (melting point of 82 ◦C), acetanilide (melting point of 118 ◦C),
erythritol (melting point of 118 ◦C) and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (melting point of 8990 ◦C).

8.6.4.2 Building Applications
PCMs can be used for temperature regulation, heat or cold storage with high storage density, and thermal
comfort in buildings that require a narrow range of temperature (Figure Typical Application of PCM
in Buildings (p. 403)). Therefore, if the solar energy is stored eectively, it can be utilized for night cold.
The use of PCMs brings an opportunity to meet the demand for heating. It helps to store the energy which
is available during daytime and to keep the temperature of the building in the comfort level.

Figure 8.64: Typical Application of PCM in Buildings Figure illustrates a typical application of
PCM in buildings. Heat storage and delivery occur over a fairly narrow temperature range. Wallboards
containing PCM have a large heat transfer area that supports large heat transfer between the wall and
the space. Source: Said Al-Hallaj182 & Riza Kizilel183
Energy storage in the walls or other components of the building may be enhanced by encapsulating PCM
within the surfaces of the building. The latent heat capacity of the PCM is used to capture solar energy
or man-made heat or cold directly and decrease the temperature swings in the building. It also maintains
the temperature closer to the desired temperature throughout the day. Researchers have proposed macro
or micro level encapsulated PCM in concrete, gypsum wallboard, ceiling and oor in order to achieve a
reasonably constant temperature range.
Today, it is possible to improve the thermal comfort and reduce the energy consumption of buildings
without substantial increase in the weight of the construction materials by the application of micro and
macro encapsulated PCM. The maximum and minimum peak temperatures can be reduced by the use of
small quantities of PCM, either mixed with the construction material or attached as a thin layer to the walls
and roofs of a building. In addition, the energy consumption can also be reduced by absorbing part of the
incident solar energy and delaying/reducing the external heat load.
The absorption of heat gains and the release of heat at night by a paran wax-based PCMs encapsulated
within a co-polymer and sandwiched between two metal sheets (PCM board) have been used in some building

materials. The PCM boards on a wall reduce the interior wall surface temperature during the charging
process, whereas the PCM wall surface temperature is higher than the other walls during the heat releasing
process. The heat ux density of a PCM wall in the melting zone is almost twice as large as that of an
ordinary wall. Also, the heat-insulation performance of a PCM wall is better than that of an ordinary wall
during the charging process, while during the heat discharging process, the PCM wall releases more heat
energy.
Unlike structural insulated panels, which exhibit fairly uniform thermal characteristics, a PCM's attributes vary depending upon environmental factors. The structural insulated panel works at all times,
resisting thermal ow from hot temperatures to colder temperatures. The thermal ux is directly proportional to the temperature dierence across the structural insulated panel insulation. The usefulness of PCM
is seen when the in-wall temperatures are such that it causes the PCM to change state. It can be inferred
that the greater the temperature dierence between day and night, the better the PCM works to reduce heat
ux. The use of a phase change material structural insulated panel wall would be excellent for geographic
areas where there is typically a large temperature swing, warm during the day and cool at night.
8.6.4.3 Vehicle Applications
Studies on viability of PCM in vehicle applications are growing widely. For example, PCMs are studied
with regard to refrigerated trucks, which are designed to carry perishable freight at specic temperatures.
Refrigerated trucks are regulated by small refrigeration units that are placed outside the vehicle in order
to keep the inside of the truck trailer at a constant temperature and relative humidity. They operate by
burning gas, hence the cost of shipment is highly aected by the changes of temperature in the trailer.
The use of PCM has helped in lowering peak heat transfer rates and total heat ows into a refrigerated
trailer. Ahmed, Meade, and Medina (2010) (p. 407) modied the conventional method of insulation of
the refrigerated truck trailer by using paran-based PCMs in the standard trailer walls as a heat transfer
reduction technology. An average reduction in peak heat transfer rate of 29.1 percent was observed when all
walls (south, east, north, west, and top) were considered, whereas the peak heat transfer rate was reduced
in the range of 11.3 - 43.8 percent for individual walls. Overall average daily heat ow reductions into the
refrigerated compartment of 16.3 percent were observed. These results could potentially translate into energy
savings, pollution abatement from diesel-burning refrigeration units, refrigeration equipment size reduction,
and extended equipment operational life.
Vehicles are mainly powered by gasoline (i.e gas or petrol). Liquied petroleum gases and diesel
are other types of uids used in vehicles. Lately, hybrid vehicles became popular among consumers as they
signicantly reduce the toxic exhaust gases if the vehicles run in electric mode. Li-ion batteries have been
used in electronic devices for a long time (cell-phones, laptops, and portable devices). Many scientists, especially in the United States, have been working on the possibility of using Li-ion batteries for transportation
applications in order to double the fuel eciency and reduce emissions of hybrid vehicles. Li-ion battery
modules can be connected in order to meet the nominal voltage of the vehicle to run the vehicle in the
electric mode. However this brings a huge problem which keeps away the uses of Li-ion batteries in many
applications: as a result of exothermic electrochemical reactions, Li-ion batteries release energy during discharge. The generated energy should be transferred from the body of the battery to environment. If the
rate of the transfer is not sucient, some of the gelled phase materials turn into gas phase and increase the
internal pressure of the cell. Therefore the energy should be released from the cell as soon as possible or the
temperature of the cell should not lead to an increase. Sveum, Kizilel, Khader, and Al-Hallaj (2007) (p. 407)
have shown that Li-ion batteries with thermal management using PCM eliminate the need for additional
cooling systems and improve available power (Figure Application with PCM Technology (p. 405)). The
researchers maintained battery packs at an optimum temperature with proper thermal management and the
PCM was capable of removing large quantities of heat due to its high latent heat of fusion.

8.6.5 Summary
There is a great interest in saving energy and in the use of renewable energies. PCMs provide an underused
option for developing new energy storage devices in order to minimize greenhouse eects. They operate at
constant temperature; as heat is added to the material, the temperature remains stable, but the heat drives
the change to a higher energy phase. A PCM stores heat in the form of latent heat of fusion which is about
100 times more than the sensible heat. Hydrated salts, paran waxes, fatty acids and eutectics of organic
and non-organic compounds are the major types of PCMs that melt at a wide range of temperatures. The
specic melting point of the PCM determines the design of thermal storage system.
In this module, applications of PCM in solar energy, buildings, and vehicles were reviewed. Solar heaters
have been popular since 1960s and PCMs have been used to store the precious energy from sun since 1980s.
They have been used extensively in solar cookers, especially in the third world countries in order to decrease
the thermal related costs. The cookers do not use fuel and hence reduce air pollution.
PCM can be used for temperature regulation in order to minimize the heat loss or gain through building
walls. They have been used to capture solar heat and decrease the temperature uctuations in buildings.
Moreover, since a small amount of PCM is sucient in order to store solar energy, thermal comfort is achieved
without substantial increase in the weight of the construction materials.
Application of PCMs in transportation is growing widely. Today, refrigerated trucks are regulated by
refrigeration units, but the use of PCMs is a viable option to prevent the denaturation of food during
transportation. The transfer rate of heat can be reduced signicantly with PCMs. Moreover, PCM makes
Li-ion batteries, which have high energy density, viable for high-power applications. The generated energy
during discharge or drive mode can be transferred from the body of the battery to environment with the help
of PCMs. Battery packs can be maintained at an optimum temperature with proper thermal management
and the PCM has been shown to be capable of removing large quantities of heat due to its high latent heat
of fusion.
Even though there is a lot of on-going research on eective and ecient applications of PCMs in a
variety of areas (e.g. solar cookers, buildings, vehicles), PCMs have yet to become a widely used technology
for sustainable energy. The advantages of PCMs are hardly known by many people and, therefore, the
applications of PCMs and their benets should be oered to consumers. The sun is out there, continuously
transferring its energy for free, but we need to do more to harness that sustainable energy for our own needs.

Problem-Solving, Metrics, and Tools for
Sustainability
9.1 Problem-Solving, Metrics, and Tools for Sustainability - Chapter
Introduction1
9.1.1 Introduction
What gets measured gets done is an oft-quoted saying (attributed to many individuals) that attempts
to capture the essential role of quantication in order to understand a system, solve a problem, advance
a cause, or establish a policy. Throughout this text a wide variety of measurements are put forth, cited,
and discussed in connection with particular concepts including climate change, economics, social well-being,
engineering eciency, and consumer habits. This chapter is devoted to a special collection of methods,
measurements, tools, indicators, and indices that are used to assess the comparative sustainability among
potential and often competing options, designs, or decisions, and to measure progress toward achieving the
goals of sustainability over time.
The chapter begins in the Module Life Cycle Assessment (Section 9.2) with a brief discussion of
industrial ecology, an emerging science that focuses on understanding material and energy ows to and
through dierent kinds of human-created systems. This kind of understanding is essential for framing
problems that need to be solved in a holistic way. Industrial ecologists study such topics as recycling and
reuse of materials, energy eciency, organizational structures, supply chains, the social impacts of decisions,
and the economics of product development. It has been termed the science of sustainability (Graedel, 2000
(p. 410)).
One of the principal tools of industrial ecology which is discussed in this chapter is life cycle assessment
(LCA), a comprehensive set of procedures for quantifying the impacts associated with the energy and resources needed to make and deliver a product or service. LCA's are carried out for two main reasons: (a) to
analyze all the steps in a product chain and see which use the greatest amount of energy and materials or
produce the most waste, and (b) to enable comparisons among alternative products or supply chains and to
see which one create the least environmental impact. Inherent in the concept of LCA is the notion of tradeos  the recognition that in a nite world choosing one product, pathway, or way of living has consequences
for environmental and social well-being. Of course choices must be made, but the goal of quantifying the
implications of our actions as holistically as possible is to avoid consequences that are unintended.
Although life cycle assessment grew out of the needs of industry to better design products and understand
the implications of their decisions, the systemic manner of framing problems upon which LCA is based has
permeated a wide variety of elds, stimulating what might be termed life cycle thinking in each of them.

410 CHAPTER 9. PROBLEM-SOLVING, METRICS, AND TOOLS FOR
SUSTAINABILITY
The Subcollection Derivative Life Cycle Concepts2
in this chapter contains modules devoted to presentations of a number of ways of expressing the impacts of humans on the environment. These are derived from
life cycle principles and are drawn from the elds of ecology, thermodynamics, and environmental science.
They include footprinting (Section 9.3.2) and several sustainability indicators (Section 9.3.1), all of
which quantify human impacts in terms of resource consumption and waste production over an extended
geographic range and/or over timeframes that go beyond the immediate. A case study on the UN Millennium Development Goals Indicator (Section 9.3.6) presents a comprehensive approach for assessing
not only environmental sustainability, but also hunger and poverty, education, gender equity, infant mortality, maternal health, disease, and global partnerships  all elements of sustainable development made clear in
the Brundtland report. Finally, this chapter concludes with a module about sustainability and business
(Section 9.4).

9.2 Life Cycle Assessment3
9.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• learn to view problem solving in a systematic and holistic manner
• understand the basic elements of industrial ecology and life cycle analysis
• become aware of available tools for conducting life cycle analysis
9.2.2 Problem Solving for Sustainability
It should be clear by now that making decisions and solving problems in support of greater sustainability
of human-created systems and their impact on the natural environment is a complex undertaking. Often
in modern life our decisions and designs are driven by a single goal or objective (e.g. greater monetary
protability, use of less energy, design for shorter travel times, generation of less waste, or reduction of risk),
but in most cases solving problems sustainably requires a more holistic approach in which the functioning
of many parts of the system must be assessed simultaneously, and multiple objectives must be integrated
when possible. Furthermore, as noted in the Brundtland Report4
(or see Chapter Introduction to Sustainability: Humanity and the Environment (Section 1.1)), often our decisions require the recognition
of tradeos  there are many kinds of impacts on the environment and most decisions that we make create
more than one impact at the same time. Of course choices must be made, but it is better if they are made
with fuller knowledge of the array of impacts that will occur. The history of environmental degradation is
littered with decisions and solutions that resulted in unintended consequences.
An illustrative example of the role of sustainability in solving problems is the issue of biofuels  turning
plant matter into usable energy (mostly liquid hydrocarbon-based fuels). When viewed from afar and with
a single goal, energy independence, using our considerable agricultural resources to turn solar energy, via
photosynthesis, into usable fuels so that we can reduce our dependence on imported petroleum appears to
be quite attractive. The United States is the largest producer of grain and forest products in the world.
It has pioneered new technologies to maintain and even increase agricultural productivity, and it has vast
processing capabilities to create articial fertilizer and to convert biomass into agricultural products (see

Module Renewable Energy: Solar, Wind, Hydro and Biomass (Section 8.4.1.4)). And, after all,
such a venture is both domestic and natural  attributes that incline many, initially at least, to be
favorably disposed. However upon closer examination this direction is not quite as unequivocally positive as
we might have thought. Yes it is possible to convert grain into ethanol and plant oils into diesel fuel, but the
great majority of these resources have historically been used to feed Americans and the animals that they
consume (and not just Americans; the United States is the world's largest exporter of agricultural products).
As demand has increased, the prices for many agricultural products have risen, meaning that some fraction
of the world's poor can no longer aord as much food. More marginal lands (which are better used for other
crops, grazing, or other uses) have been brought under cultivation for fermentable grains, and there have
been parallel indirect consequences globally  as the world price of agricultural commodities has risen,
other countries have begun diverting land from existing uses to crops as well. Furthermore, agricultural
runo from articial fertilizers has contributed to over 400 regional episodes of hypoxia in estuaries around
the world, including the U.S. Gulf Coast and Chesapeake Bay.
In response to such problems, U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act5
in
2007, which limits the amount of grain that can be converted into biofuels in favor of using agriculturallyderived cellulose, the chief constituent of the cell walls of plants. This has given rise to a large scientic and
technological research and development program to devise economical ways to process cellulosic materials into
ethanol, and parallel eorts to investigate new cellulosic cropping systems that include, for example, native
grasses6
. Thus, the seemingly simple decision to grow our biofuels industry in response to a political objective
has had unintended political, nancial, dietary, social, land use, environmental quality, and technological
consequences.
With hindsight, the multiple impacts of biofuels have become clear, and there is always the hope that
we can learn from examples like this. But we might also ask if there is a way to foresee all or at least
some of these impacts in advance, and adjust our designs, processes, and policies to take them into account
and make more informed decisions, not just for biofuels but also for complex societal problems of a similar
nature. This approach is the realm of the eld of industrial ecology, and the basis for the tool of life
cycle assessment (LCA), a methodology that has been designed to perform holistic analyses of complex
systems.
9.2.3 Industrial Ecology
Many systems designed by humans focus on maximizing protability for the rm, business or corporation. In
most cases this means increasing production to meet demand for the products or services being delivered. An
unfortunate byproduct of this is the creation of large amounts of waste, many of which have signicant impacts if they enter the environment. Figure Human-Designed Industry (Figure 9.1) is a general-purpose
diagram of a typical manufacturing process, showing the inputs of materials and energy, the manufacturing
of products, and the generation of wastes (the contents of the manufacturing box are generic and not meant
to depict any particular industryit could be a mine, a factory, a power plant, a city, or even a university).
What many nd surprising is the large disparity between the amounts of waste produced and the quantity of
product delivered. Table Waste-to-Product Ratios for Selected Industries (Table 9.1) provides such
information, in the form of waste-to-product ratios, for a few common industries.

That industrial systems designed to maximize production and/or prots while ignoring wastes should
be so materially inecient is not surprising. As noted in the Module Sustainability and Public Policy
(Section 2.4), the impacts of wastes on human health and the environment have historically been ignored, or
steeply underpriced, so that little incentive has existed to limit waste production. More recently laws have
been enacted that attempt to force those responsible for waste emissions into a more appropriate accounting
(see Chapters Environmental and Resource Economics (Section 8.1) and Modern Environmental
Management (Section 7.1) for a fuller treatment of the laws, regulations, and practices used to incorporate
society's costs into the production chain). Once realistic costs are assigned to the waste sector, manufacturers
are quick to innovate and investigate ways to eliminate them.

In 1989, Robert Frosch & Nicholas Gallopoulos, who worked in the General Motors Research Laboratory,
published an important analysis of this problem in Scientic American (Frosch and Gallopoulos, 1989 (p.
424)). Their paper was entitled Strategies for Manufacturing9
; in it they posed a critical question: Why is
it that human-designed manufacturing systems are so wasteful, but systems in nature produce little, if any,
waste? Although there had been many studies on ways to minimize or prevent wastes, this was the rst to
seek a systemic understanding of what was fundamentally dierent about human systems in distinction to
natural systems. The paper is widely credited with spawning the new eld of Industrial Ecology, an applied
science that studies material and energy ows through industrial systems. Industrial Ecology10 is concerned
with such things as closing material loops (recycling and reuse), process and energy eciency, organizational
behavior, system costs, and social impacts of goods and services. A principle tool of Industrial Ecology is
life cycle assessment.
9.2.4 Life Cycle Assessment Basics
LCA11 is a systems methodology for compiling and evaluating information on materials and energy as they
ow through a product or service manufacturing chain. It grew out of the needs of industry, in the early
1960s, to understand manufacturing systems, supply chains, and market behavior, and make choices among
competing designs, processes, and products. It was also applied to the evaluation of the generation and
emission of wastes from manufacturing activities. During the 1970s and 1980s general interest in LCA for
environmental evaluation declined as the nation focused on the control of toxic substances and remediation
of hazardous waste sites (see Chapters The Evolution of Environmental Policy in the United States
(Section 2.1) and Modern Environmental Management (Section 7.1)), but increasing concern about
global impacts, particularly those associated with greenhouse gas emissions, saw renewed interest in the
development of the LCA methodology and more widespread applications.
LCA is a good way to understand the totality of the environmental impacts and benets of a product
or service. The method enables researchers and practitioners to see where along the product chain material
and energy are most intensively consumed and waste produced. It allows for comparisons with conventional products that may be displaced in commerce by new products, and helps to identify economic and
environmental tradeos.
LCA can facilitate communication of risks and benets to stakeholders and consumers (e.g. the carbon
footprint12 of individual activities and life styles). Perhaps most importantly of all, LCA can help to prevent
unintended consequences, such as creating solutions to problems that result in the transferal of environmental
burdens from one area to another, or from one type of impact to another.
A complete LCA assessment denes a system as consisting of four general stages of the product or service
chain, each of which can be further broken down into substages:
• Acquisition of materials (through resource extraction or recycled sources)
• Manufacturing, rening, and fabrication
• Use by consumers
• End-of-life disposition (incineration, landlling, composting, recycling/reuse)
Each of these involves the transport of materials within or between stages, and transportation has its own
set of impacts.
In most cases, the impacts contributed from each stage of the LCA are uneven, i.e. one or two of the
stages may dominate the assessment. For example, in the manufacture of aluminum products it is acquisition
of materials (mining), purication of the ore, and chemical reduction of the aluminum into metal that create

SUSTAINABILITY
environmental impacts. Subsequent usage of aluminum products by consumers contributes very few impacts,
although the facilitation of recycling of aluminum is an important step in avoiding the consumption of primary
materials and energy. In contrast, for internal combustion-powered automobiles, usage by consumers creates
70-80% of the life cycle impacts. Thus, it is not always necessary that the LCA include all stages of analysis;
in many cases it is only a portion of the product/service chain that is of interest, and often there is not enough
information to include all stages anyway. For this reason there are certain characteristic terminologies for
various scopes of LCAs that have emerged:
• Cradle-to-grave: includes the entire material/energy cycle of the product/material, but excludes recycling/reuse.
• Cradle-to-cradle: includes the entire material cycle, including recycling/reuse.
• Cradle-to-gate: includes material acquisition, manufacturing/rening/fabrication (factory gate), but
excludes product uses and end-of-life.
• Gate-to-gate: a partial LCA looking at a single added process or material in the product chain.
• Well-to-wheel: a special type of LCA involving the application of fuel cycles to transportation vehicles.
• Embodied energy: A cradle-to-gate analysis of the life cycle energy of a product, inclusive of the
latent energy in the materials, the energy used during material acquisition, and the energy used in
manufacturing intermediate and nal products. Embodied energy is sometimes referred to as emergy,
or the cumulative energy demand (CED) of a product or service.
9.2.5 LCA Methodology
Over time the methodology for conducting Life Cycle Analyses (LCAs) has been rened and standardized; it
is generally described as taking place in four steps: scoping, inventory, impact assessment, and interpretation.
The rst three of these are consecutive, while the interpretation step is an ongoing process that takes place
throughout the methodology. Figure General Framework for Life Cycle Assessment (Figure 9.2)
illustrates these in a general way.

9.2.5.1 Scoping
Scoping is arguably the most important step for conducting an LCA. It is here that the rationale for
carrying out the assessment is made explicit, where the boundaries of the system are dened, where the data
quantity, quality, and sources are specied, and where any assumptions that underlie the LCA are stated.
This is critically important both for the quality of the resultant analysis, and for comparison among LCAs
for competing or alternative products.
9.2.5.2 Inventory Analysis
The inventory analysis step involves the collection of information on the use of energy and various materials
used to make a product or service at each part of the manufacturing process. If it is true that scoping
is the most important step in an LCA then the inventory is probably the most tedious since it involves
locating, acquiring, and evaluating the quality of data and specifying the sources of uncertainties that may
have arisen. For products that have been produced for a long time and for which manufacturing processes
are well known, such as making steel, concrete, paper, most plastics, and many machines, data are readily

SUSTAINABILITY
available. But for newer products that are either under development or under patent protection, data are
often considered proprietary and are generally not shared in open sources. Uncertainty can arise because of
missing or poorly documented data, errors in measurement, or natural variations caused by external factors
(e.g., weather patterns can cause considerable variation in the outputs of agricultural systems or the ways that
consumers use products and services can cause variability in the emission of pollutants and the disposition
of the product at end of life). Often the manufacturing chain of a process involves many steps resulting
in a detailed inventory analysis. Figure Detailed System Flow Diagram for Bar Soap (Figure 9.3),
for example, shows the manufacturing ow for a bar of soap (this diagram is for making bar soap using
saponicationthe hydrolysis of triglycerides using animal fats and lye). The inventory requires material
and energy inputs and outputs for each of these steps, although it may turn out that some steps contribute
little to the ultimate impact analysis. For example, the inventory associated with capital equipment for a
manufacturing process, i.e. machines that are replaced at lengthy intervals such that their impacts in the
short term are minimal, are often omitted from the analysis.
There are two additional aspects of LCA that should also be addressed during inventory analysis: the
functional unit of comparison, and the allocation of inventory quantities among co-products or services.
The functional unit is the basis for comparing two or more products, processes, or services that assure equality
of the function delivered. This may seem like a straightforward task. For example, for the soap produced by
the process of Figure Detailed System Flow Diagram for Bar Soap (Figure 9.3), one might choose one
bar of soap as a functional unit of comparison. But then how would a LCA comparison be made with, say,
liquid hand soap or a body wash product (which combines the functionality of soap and shampoo)? Perhaps
number of washings would be a better choice, or maybe concentration of surfactant made available per
average use (in the latter case an average dose would need to be dened). Furthermore, soaps have other
additives and attributes such as scents, lotions, colors, and even the functionality of the shape  factors that
may not aect cleaning eectiveness but certainly do have an impact on consumer preferences, and hence
quantity sold. Since it is quite likely that essentially all soaps purchased by consumers will eventually be
washed down the drain, such marketability factors may indeed have an environmental impact.
Inventory data are virtually always sought for a total supply-manufacturing-consumer-use chain rather
than individual products, thus when that same chain produces multiple products it is necessary to allocate the
materials, energy, and wastes among them. Again, referring to Figure Detailed System Flow Diagram
for Bar Soap (Figure 9.3), there are potentially several co-products produced: tallow and other animal
products, forest products, cardboard and paper, and salable scrap. There are generally three ways to allocate
materials and energy among co-products: mass, volume, and economic value. Mass and volume allocations
are the most straightforward, but may not capture market forces that are important in bringing materials into
the environment. Allocation via economic valuation usually reects the value of the energy and any value
added to the raw materials, but may miss the impacts of the materials themselves. In addition, market
values may uctuate over time. In the nal analysis the important aspect of any allocation procedure is that
it be fully documented.

9.2.5.3 Impact Assessment
The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) takes the inventory data on material resources used, energy
consumed, and wastes emitted by the system and estimates potential impacts on the environment. At
rst glance, given that an inventory may include thousands of substances, it may seem that the number
Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11325/1.45>
418 CHAPTER 9. PROBLEM-SOLVING, METRICS, AND TOOLS FOR
SUSTAINABILITY
of potential impacts is bewilderingly large, but the problem is made more tractable through the application of a system of impact classications within which various inventory quantities can be grouped as
having similar consequences on human health or the environment. Sometimes inventoried quantities in a
common impact category originate in dierent parts of the life cycle and often possess very dierent chemical/biological/physical characteristics. The LCIA groups emissions based on their common impacts rather
than on their chemical or physical properties, choosing a reference material for which health impacts are
well known, as a basic unit of comparison. A key aspect is the conversion of impacts of various substances
into the reference unit. This is done using characterization factors, some of which are well-known, such as
global warming potential14 and ozone depletion potential15 , and LC50
16 (the concentration of a substance at
which fty percent of an exposed population is killed), and others are still under development. Table Common Impact Categories and Their References (Table 9.2) presents several impact categories that are
frequently used in the LCIA along with their references. The categories listed in Table Common Impact
Categories and Their References (Table 9.2) are not exhaustive  new types of impact categories, such
as land use and social impacts  and continue to be developed.

An example will help to illustrate the type of information that results from life cycle inventory and
impact assessments. In this case, a system that produces a biologically-derived plastic, polylactide, is
examined. (PLA)18 . PLA has been proposed as a more sustainable alternative to plastics produced from
petroleum because it is made from plant materials, in this case corn, yet has properties that are similar
to plastics made from petroleum. Figure Processing Diagram for Making Polylactide (Figure 9.4)
shows a schematic of the system, which is a cradle-to-gate assessment. As with any plastic, PLA can be
turned into a variety of nal products and each will have dierent cradle-to-grave LCA characteristics. The
production of PLA involves growing corn, harvesting and processing the grain, and polymerizing the lactic
acid molecules produced from fermentation. At each step a variety of chemicals and energy are used or
produced. It is these production materials that contribute to the impact analysis. Inventory quantities were
allocated among major bio-products on a mass basis.

Among the inventory data acquired in this case is life cycle fossil fuel used by the system, mostly to
power farming equipment (Agriculture), wet-mill corn (CWM), heat fermentation vats (Ferment), and
Polymerization (Polym). The transport of intermediate products from sources to the processing center is

equal mass basis (the functional unit is one kilogram of plastic). The PLA inventory also shows the
sources of fossil fuel used for each step along the manufacturing chain, with the fermentation step being the
most intense user. What may not be obvious is that the total greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted from the
process, on an equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2) basis, are generally higher for the biopolymer in comparison
with the petroleum polymers in spite of the lower fossil fuel usage. When the data are examined closely this
is due to the agricultural step, which consumes generates relatively little fossil fuel, but is responsible for a
disproportionate amount of emissions of GHGs, mostly in the form of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse
gas (310 times the global warming potential of CO2) that is a by-product of fertilizer application to elds.
This example also illustrates counter-intuitive results that LCAs often generate, a principal reason why it is
important to conduct them.
9.2.6 Interpretation of LCA
The interpretation step of LCA occurs throughout the analysis. As noted above, issues related to the
rationale for conducting the LCA, dening the system and setting its boundaries, identifying data needs,
sources, and quality, and choosing functional units, allocation procedures, and appropriate impact categories
must all be addressed as the LCA unfolds. There are essentially two formal reasons for conducting an LCA:
(a) identication of hot spots where material and/or energy use and waste emissions, both quantity and
type, are greatest so that eorts can be focused on improving the product chain; and (b) comparison of
results between and among other LCAs in order to gain insight into the preferable product, service, process,
or pathway. In both cases, there are cautions that apply to the interpretation of results.
9.2.6.1 Assumptions
Typically a variety of assumption must be made in order to carry out the LCA. Sometimes these are minor,
for example, exclusion of elements of the study that clearly have no appreciable impact on the results, and
sometimes more critical, for example choosing one set of system boundaries over another. These must be
explicitly stated, and nal results should be interpreted in light of assumptions made
9.2.6.2 Data Quality, Uncertainty, and Sensitivity
In the course of conducting an LCA it is usually the case that a variety of data sources will be used. In some
cases these may be from the full-scale operation of a process, in others the source is from a small scale or
even laboratory scale, in still other cases it may be necessary to simulate information from literature sources.
Such heterogeneity inevitably leads to uncertainty in the nal results; there are several statistical methods
that can be applied to take these into account. An important aspect of the completed LCA is the degree of
sensitivity the results display when key variables are perturbed. Highly sensitive steps in the chain have a
greater need to narrow uncertainties before drawing conclusions with condence.
9.2.6.3 Incommensurability
Sometimes LCA impact categories, such as those shown in Table Common Impact Categories and
Their References (Table 9.2), overlap in the sense that the same pollutant may contribute to more than
one category. For instance, if a given assessment comes up with high scores for both aquatic toxicity and
human toxicity from, say, pesticide use then one might be justied in using both of these categories to draw
conclusions and make choices based on LCA results. However, more typically elevated scores are found for
categories that are not directly comparable. For instance, the extraction, rening, and use of petroleum
generate a high score for global warming (due to GHG release), while the product chain for the biofuel
ethanol has a high score for eutrophication (due to nitrogen release during the farming stage). Which
problem is worse  climate change or coastal hypoxia? Society may well choose a course of action that favors
one direction over another, but in this case the main value of the LCA is to identify the tradeos and inform
us of the consequences, not tell us which course is correct.

SUSTAINABILITY
9.2.6.4 Risk Evaluation and Regulation
One of the inherent limits to LCA is its use for assessing risk. Risk assessment and management, as
described in the Modules The Evolution of Environmental Policy in the United States (Section 2.1)
and Modern Environmental Management (Section 7.1), is a formal process that quanties risks for
a known population in a specic location exposed to a specic chemical for a dened period of time. It
generates risk values in terms of the probability of a known consequence due to a sequence of events that are
directly comparable, and upon which decisions on water, land, and air quality standards and their violation
can be and are made. LCA is a method for evaluating the impacts of wastes on human health and the
environment from the point of view of the product/service chain rather than a particular population. It
can be used to identify the sources of contamination and general impacts on the environment  a sort of
where to look guide for regulation, but its direct use in the environmental regulatory process has been, to
date, rather limited. One application for LCA that has been suggested for regulatory use is for assessing
the impacts of biofuel mandates on land use practices, in the United States and other regions, however no
regulatory standards for land use have yet been proposed.
9.2.7 Tools for Conducting LCA
Fortunately a number of databases and tools, in the form of computer software, are available to assist in
carrying out LCAs. This is an active area of development; in this section a few of the more well-known and
widely used tools are described.
9.2.7.1 The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation Model
(GREET)
GREET19 is a spreadsheet-based database developed by Argonne National Laboratory that links energy use
to emissions on a life cycle basis. Early versions were limited to greenhouse gases, but as the model has been
rened many other types of contaminants have been added. Although it has been widely used for comparing
transportation and fuel options (hence its title), GREET has been used for many other applications that have
a signicant energy component, including agriculture, material and product development, and strategies for
recycling.
9.2.7.2 SimaPro
SimaPro20 was developed by PRé Consultants in the Netherlands. It is a process-based tool for analyzing
products and systems for their energy usage and environmental impacts over their life cycle. It contains
a number of databases for simulating processes, performing inventories, assembling products and systems,
analyzing results, and assessing life cycle impacts, and features modules for performing uncertainty and
sensitivity analyses.
9.2.7.3 Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts
(TRACI)
TRACI21 is a tool for performing life cycle impact analyses developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. It uses inventory data as input information to perform a mid-point impact analysis using categories
such as those shown in Table Common Impact Categories and Their References (Table 9.2). A midpoint analysis assesses impact based upon results at a common point in the risk chain, for example, global
warming potential, because subsequent end-point impact assessments require several assumptions and value
choices that often dier from case to case. The values for the various impact categories given in Table
Common Impact Categories and Their References (Table 9.2) are mid-point references.

9.2.7.4 Economic Input Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA)
EIO-LCA (http://www.eiolca.net/22 ) takes a dierent approach to the development of a life cycle assessment. In comparison with the somewhat complicated bottom-up approach described above, EIO-LCA uses
a more aggregated, matrix-based approach in which the economy is composed of several hundred sectors,
each linked to the other through a series of factors. EIO was rst developed in the 1950s by Wassily Leontief
(1905-1999) who was awarded a Nobel Prize in economics for his work. EIO has proven to be a very useful
tool for national and regional economic planning. The developers of EIO-LCA then linked the main economic model to a series of environmental impacts. EIO-LCA uses economic measures to perturb the system;
for example, if a factory seeks to increase its output by ten percent, then the aggregated inputs across the
economy will have to increase by ten percent. Of course some of the inputs from some sectors will increase
very little if at all, while others will bear the major brunt of the increase in output by increasing input. In
EIO-LCA, part of the new outputs will be increased contaminant loads to the environment.
EIO-LCA has several advantages in comparison with the bottom-up approach. There is no need to be
concerned with dening system boundaries, i.e. the boundary is the entire economy of the United States
(or a sub-region), which includes all material and energy inputs and outputs. The data used in EIO-LCA are,
for the most part, already collected by the federal government thereby obviating the tedium of the inventory
stage. Finally, software models are readily available to carry out the analysis. While a bottom-up LCA
may take months or even years to complete, EIO-LCA typically takes a few hours.
Of course, at this level of aggregation much information is lost, especially on how the system actually
functions. For example, the energy sector of the economy includes electricity generated, but doesn't
distinguish among nuclear, fossil, or renewable sources. And if one is concerned with the functional reasons
for a particular result, EIO-LCA will be of limited use. Often the bottom-up and EIO-LCA approaches
are combined (a hybrid approach).
9.2.8 Conclusions
The life cycle approach is a useful way to come to an understanding of the material and energy needed to
make a product or deliver a service, see where wastes are generated, and estimate the subsequent impacts
that these wastes may have on the environment. It is a good way to improve a product chain, articulate
tradeos, and make comparisons among alternative processes and products. In these contexts LCA facilitates
decision making by managers, designers, and other stakeholders. Most importantly, LCA is a way of framing
policy options in a comprehensive and systematic way.

9.3.1.2 Introduction
The ideal method to measure sustainability would reect the three-legged stool paradigm  environmental
protection, social equity, and economic benet. The metrics must make the connection between what the
indicators measure and actual sustainability. A useful indicator will reect changes over time that show
whether a system is becoming more or less sustainable, and generally substitutes for something else or
represents several measures (Sahely, 2005 (p. 435)). The challenge of studying sustainability as an objective
science is that the work is value-loaded and socially charged. If we are aware of the purpose of the analysis
we can use a multidisciplinary approach to the problem denition and the research methodology (Lele and
Norgaard, 1996 (p. 435)).
Figure 9.7: Information Pyramid The Information Pyramid shows ways of handling data when
studying sustainability. Source: C. Klein-Banai25
.
In general, three approaches to sustainability measurement and reporting are commonly utilized: accounts
that use quantitative data and convert them to a common unit such as money, area or energy; narrative
assessments that include text, maps, graphics and tabular data; and indicator-based systems that
may include the information that a narrative assessment has but they are organized around indicators or
measurable parts of a system. Indicator-based systems are generally found to perform better and are easily
measurable and comparable since they are more objective than narrative systems, or use only individual
data points (Dalal-Clayton, 2002 (p. 435)). Decision-makers and stakeholders need to participate in the
development of indicators to be sure that their values and concerns are addressed. However, the system does
need to be technically and scientically based.
In the next few modules we will briey discuss existing sustainability metrics that are generally based
within certain disciplines such as ecology, economics, and physics, and how they may reect other disciplines
(see Table Common Sustainability Metrics (Table 9.3: Common Sustainability Metrics)). Most of these
metrics are described in greater details in the following modules: The IPAT Equation (Section 1.3),

9.3.1.3 Ecological Measures
Ecological measures of sustainability are used for natural systems. These measures include resilience and
several constructs that are derivatives from carrying capacity. Resilience is the time needed for a system
that provides desirable ecosystem goods and services to go back to a dened dynamic regime after
disturbance. Resilience stresses the changing nature of ecosystems, rather than seeing them as static and
providing a continuous and constant amount of natural resources. Carrying capacity estimates society's
total use of the resource stocks and ows provided by an ecosystem relative to the remaining resources needed
by the ecosystem for stability and regeneration. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is an outgrowth of
carrying capacity and the goal is to reach the maximum amount of resource extraction while not depleting the
resource from one harvest to the next. Sustainability, in this context, can be understood as the point when
the rate of resource extraction or harvest (MSY) equals the amount produced by the ecosystem. Previously
discussed methods are types of measures of sustainability such as IPAT (see Module The IPAT Equation
(Section 1.3)) which accounts for the eect of society on the amount of resources used when looking at
carrying capacity. This type of measure looks at whether the impact of a human society is increasing or
decreasing over time and can be used to compare impacts between societies of dierence sizes or auence
levels.
Footprinting (see Module Footprinting: Carbon, Ecological and Water (Section 9.3.2)) is often
used as a measure of sustainability that can be understood intuitively and is, therefore, useful when talking
to the general public. The ecological footprint, which also represents the carrying capacity of the earth, is
dened as the total area of productive land and water ecosystems required to produce the resources that
the population consumes and assimilate the wastes that the population produces, wherever on Earth that
land and water may be located (Rees and Wackernagel, 1996 (p. 435)). This results in an evaluation of the
demand and supply of natural capital of a given population (individual to planet) or a product/service.

428 CHAPTER 9. PROBLEM-SOLVING, METRICS, AND TOOLS FOR
SUSTAINABILITY
Life-cycle assessment (LCA), a structured methodology that can be utilized to evaluate the environmental
impacts of products, processes, projects, or services throughout their life cycles from cradle to grave (see
Module Life Cycle Assessment (Section 9.2)) may be considered an ecological metric. A greenhouse
gas emissions inventory is an example of this methodology (see Case Study: Greenhouse Gases and
Climate Change (Section 8.3)).
9.3.1.4 Economic Measures
Economic measures place a monetary value on sustainability. Economists use the following measures of
sustainability: ecosystem valuation, contingent valuation, and net national product, which are discussed in
Chapter Environmental and Resource Economics (Section 6.1). Standard economic methods can be
used to evaluate environmental projects.
Indices that are used on a national and international level by organizations like the United Nations may
be used to examine the economic and social welfare of a region. The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare
(ISEW)27 and other related frameworks that account for sustainable development have been conceived
to provide an alternative to the Gross Domestic Product28 , which does not capture human welfare in
its calculations. This system weights personal expenditures within a population with an index of income
inequality and a set of factors are then added or subtracted to this monetary value. Monetary analysis of
sustainability does not value the variety of sustainability issues especially those that cannot be measured as
a product or service in today's markets (Gasparatos, et al., 2008 (p. 435)).
9.3.1.5 Physical Measures
Physical measures of sustainability use thermodynamic concepts in their calculations. Two physical approaches to measuring sustainability are exergy and emergy. These concepts are derived from the second
law of thermodynamics which states that a closed system with constant mass and no energy inputs tends
toward higher entropy or disorder. For instance, a piece of wood that is the product of many years of complex tree growth releases energy (light and heat in the ame) when burned, and becomes carbon ash, smoke,
gases, and water vapor. This means that as properties within a system such as mass, energy, and chemical
concentrations degrade (decompose) over time or burn, they also make available useful energy (exergy) for
work. Ecosystems and human economies function under this second law, but they can use external energy
(the sun) to maintain or increase energy supplies.
Emergy is the amount of energy of one kind (solar) that has been used directly or indirectly (through
a transformation process) to make a service or a product of one type and it is expressed in units of (solar
energy) emjoule. It can be thought of as a measure of all the entropy that has been produced over the
whole process of creating a given product or service (Brown and Ulgiati, 2002 (p. 435)). An example is
the process of fossil fuel creation: solar energy was used by plants to grow and is stored in the complex
molecular structures that held the plants together, when those plants died they decomposed and were buried
over time under the changing earth, and the energy was concentrated into fossil fuels. Emergy, thus, allows
us to account for all the environmental support needed by human and eco-systems or inputs.
Measures of energy inputs are transformed to emergy by use of a factor that represents the amount of
environmental work needed to produce a product or provide a service. The emergy ows within a system include renewable resources (sunlight, rain, wind, agricultural production, timber harvest, etc.), non-renewable
production (fossil fuels, metals, minerals, soils), and imports/exports. A sustainable system would have a net
positive (or zero) emergy ow across its boundary (Mayer, et al., 2004 (p. 435)). Emergy evaluations have
been used, for instance, to quantitatively demonstrate that renewable energy plants had higher sustainability
compared to thermal plants (Brown and Ugliati, 2002 (p. 435)).
Exergy can be dened as the maximum work that can be extracted from a system as it moves to
thermodynamic equilibrium with a reference state, as in the example of burned wood above. It has been
used to study eciency of chemical and thermal processes. This represents an entropy-free form of energy
27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Sustainable_Economic_Welfare
28http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product
Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11325/1.45>
429
that is a measure of its usefulness, quality or potential to make change. Exergy accounting provides insights
into the metabolism of a system and its eect on the environment using a common denominator. It can
address energy utilization, be used for design and analysis of energy systems and to quantify waste and
energy losses reecting resource use. Exergy can account for an economic component, labor input, and
impact of emissions on human health (Gasparatos, et al., 2008 (p. 435); Odum, 1996 (p. 435)).
9.3.1.6 Comparison of Measures
So far we highlighted three categories for measures of sustainability  ecological, economic, and physical
 and provided a few examples. Sustainability measures is an evolving eld of study and the metrics are
innumerable. Ecological measures include indicators that try to measure the sustainability of the ecosystem
as a whole. Economic metrics use monetary measures and try to put a price on the environment and its
services. They are valued based on currency, which is an anthropocentric value, meaning it is signicant only
to humans. They account only for human welfare to the extent that it depends on nature to survive. They
do not account for the eect on an ecosystem as a whole, including plants and animals. Physical metrics are
closely tied to thermodynamics and energy, and are generally expressed in units of energy.
Sustainability indicators are needed to improve our understanding of the nature of human demands
on ecosystems and the extent to which these can be modied. Society uses resources for physical and
social infrastructure and continually increases its needs due to population growth which is made possible
by changing the way we grow and produce food, thus manipulating the food web. Some of these economic
metrics are closely tied to social sustainability metrics as well and try to account for the social welfare of a
population. Overall, while physical tools can capture certain environmental and economic issues, too, they
do not address economic issues from the same perspective as conventional economic analysis. Moreover, they
do not capture most social issues.
Economic markets do not usually directly value goods and services that ecological systems provide to
human economies and societies. These ecosystem services include the uptake of carbon dioxide by plants and
trees, purication of water by microorganisms, enrichment of soil through degradation of plant and animal
materials, and rainfall that provides irrigation (see Constanza, et al., 1997 (p. 435)). Also economists
do not agree on the degree of substitutability between natural and man-made capital. This concept of
substitutability means that natural capital such as 100 year old (old forest) trees used to build homes
and furniture can be replaced by replanting fast-growing trees and provide the same value (Pearce, 1993 (p.
435)). Technology also transforms the use of resources for instance by making them more readily available
and more economic. An example of this is the use of fracking to produce natural gas from sources that
were dicult to extract from a decade ago (see Module Environmental Challenges in Energy, Carbon
Dioxide, Air and Water (Section 8.2)).
9.3.1.7 Sustainability Indicators and Composite Indices
There is no single indicator that can capture all aspects of sustainability within complex systems. When we
speak of systems, we are referring to institutions, cities, regions, or nations. However, a group of indicators
could be selected and analyzed under certain criteria that will better represent this type of system. An
indicator represents a particular operational attribute of a system such as overall energy reduction, a GHG
gas emissions inventory, what percentage of people commute by public transit, or percentage of people with
a college degree. These are measured or observed at dierent times, locations, populations or combinations
thereof. The Figure Information Pyramid (Figure 9.7) represents the relationship between all these
measures.
A group of indicators can then be evaluated using a composite indicator/index (CI) or rating. CIs stand
at the top of an information pyramid where primary data lies at the base, followed by analyzed data, then
indicators, and topped by indices. A composite indicator is formed by the compilation of various individual
indicators into one index based on an underlying model. (Nardo, et al., 2005 (p. 435)). An example is the
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)29 which is a green building certication system

430 CHAPTER 9. PROBLEM-SOLVING, METRICS, AND TOOLS FOR
SUSTAINABILITY
developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC)30 . It accounts for a large variety of building
attributes that contribute to a building being considered sustainable such as building materials, location,
landscape, energy usage, access to alternative transportation and so on. The nal result is a numerical rating
for the building that is then associated with a certain certication level (Certied, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
This kind of system is most widely accepted and valued when a peer-review is conducted to determine what
weights should be given to each attribute. When the USGBC decided to update its rating system because it
did not accurately reect the values of its members, it underwent review through its various committees31
.
Sometimes, when you have a lot of dierent measures that use dierent units you do not want to aggregate them together into one number. In this case, a multi-criteria assessment (MCA) can be used where
constituent indicators are not aggregated into a single index. Multi-criteria analysis (similar name, dierent
context) can be used as a tool to establish weights for several criteria, without requiring that all data be
converted into the same units (Hermann, 2007 (p. 435)). There are several multi-criteria evaluation methods
that can be used for this. These methods may either be data-driven (bottom-up) when high-quality data is
available or theory driven (top-down) when data is available for only one of the aspects. A broader review
of this can be found in Gasparatos, et al. (2008) (p. 435).
Many industry sectors are developing frameworks or rating systems that provide ways to report and
measure sustainability. Two examples are discussed here.
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)32 provides a system for organizations to publish their sustainability
performance. Its purpose is to provide transparency and accountability for stakeholders and to be comparable
among organizations. It is developed in an international, multi-stakeholder process and it is continuously
improved. An organization determines which indicators from among those proposed it will report. However,
no overall index or scores are reported. There is also usually a narrative portion to the report (Global
Reporting Initiative). The indicators are broken down in environmental, economic and social performance
indicators. Each area has core indicators with some additional indicators that may be used based on the
organization's choice.
The American Association of Higher Education (AASHE)33 , is the lead organization in North America
for sustainability in colleges and universities. One of their major projects has been the development of
the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS)34 . This is a voluntary, self-reporting
framework that is to be used to measure relative progress of universities and colleges as they work toward
sustainability. STARS was developed using a collaborative process that involved input from many institutions. In 2008, a pilot study of 66 institutions was conducted to test the viability of the system and STARS
version 1.0 was released in January 2010 with many schools reporting by January 2011. The credits are
given in three categories of equal weight  education and research; operations; planning, administration
and engagement. Each credit is given a weight based on the extent to which the credit contributes to improved environmental, nancial and social impacts, and whether there are educational benets associated
with the achievement of this credit and the breadth of that impact. The result is a composite indicator,
with transparent individual scoring. Schools participating in STARS will use an on-line reporting tool which
makes the results publicly available. Depending on the total points achieved, a level of achievement is be
assigned. The STARS rating will be good for three years but a school may choose to update annually. See
Case Study: Comparing Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Ecological Footprint and Sustainability Rating of a
University (Section 9.3.3) for an example of this reporting.
9.3.1.8 Examples of How an Index is Developed
Krajnc and Glavic (2005) (p. 435) developed a composite sustainable development index (ICSD) to track
economic, environmental and social performance of company. Economic, environmental, and social subindices were calculated from normalized indicators within each sector. To calculate normalized indicators,
30http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988

431
the indicators for each sector, which typically have dierent units, were divided by the value in time (year)
with its average value of all the time in the years measured. Alternatively, they can be normalized by using
maximum and minimum values or target values. The Analytic Hierarchy Process35 was used to determine
the weights of the environmental indicators. This is a multi-attribute decision model. The steps are:
1. Setting the problem as a hierarchy with the top being the objective of the decision and lower levels
consist of the criteria used at arriving at the decision.
2. Pair-wise comparisons between two indicators.
3. Use of a consistency ratio to check the consistency of each judgment.
4. Step-by-step procedure of grouping various basic indicators into the sustainability sub-index.
5. Sub-indices are combined into the composite sustainable development index.
The economic, environmental and social measures that were used in this model are as follows:
Economic Environmental Social
Sales Total energy consumption No. of occupational accidents
Operating prot Water consumption No. of non-prot projects
Investment capital & expenditures
Production mass No. of odor complains
Net earnings Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides,
sulfur dioxide & dust emissions
No. of noise complaints
Research & development costs Wastewater No. of dust complaints
Number of employees Waste for disposal No. of neighbor complaints
Recycling
Hazardous waste
Table 9.4
An analytical tool, called COMPLIMENT, was developed to provide detailed information on the overall
environmental impact of a business (Hermann, 2007 (p. 435)). This tool integrates the concepts of life
cycle assessment, multi-criteria analysis and environmental performance indicators. The combinations of
environmental performance indicators used depend on the organization and reect the relevant parts of the
production train. The method includes setting system boundaries, data collection, calculation of potential
environmental impacts and their normalization, aggregation of impacts using a multi-criteria analysis, the
weights per impact category are multiplied by normalization potential impacts and the results can be added
up for each perspective. The system boundary strives to be cradle-to-grave (from extraction of resources
to disposal) although it may be a cradle-to-gate (from extraction of resources to completion of production)
analysis.
Adoption of any single group of tools means that a certain perspective will be more highly represented in
the sustainability assessment. The need to address the multitude of environmental, social, economic issues,
together with intergenerational and intragenerational equity concerns (Gasparatos, et al., 2008 (p. 435),
p. 306) produces problems that none of the disciplinary approaches can solve separately. Combining the
outputs of biophysical and monetary tools will result in a more comprehensive sustainability perspective.
The result is that the choice of metrics and tools must be made based on the context and characteristics
that are desired by the analysts (Gasparatos, et al., 2008 (p. 435)). Using a composite indicator or a set
of individual indicators presented together can overcome the problem of using a single metric to measure
sustainability.

432 CHAPTER 9. PROBLEM-SOLVING, METRICS, AND TOOLS FOR
SUSTAINABILITY
Existing indicator-based sustainability assessments vary in the number of subsystems or assessment areas,
the number of levels between subsystem and indicator, and whether they result in an index (compound
indicator) of the state of the system and subsystems. These would include the ecosystem or environment,
people or economy and society, and possibly institutions. The more subsystems assigned, the lower the weight
given to the environmental portion. As more indicator systems are developed they become increasingly
complex, yet there is a demand for a simple presentation that does not erase the complexity. A single
indicator with true signicance is not achievable, but by combining indicators into indices the results are
more meaningful.
9.3.1.9 Representing Results for Multi-Criteria Assessment
Since measuring sustainability does not come down to a simple metric or few it is useful to use visualization
techniques to display the results. One way to depict sustainability performance is to use a graphical view
of progress, as shown in Figure Visualizing Results of Sustainability (p. 432) below for the GRI for
universities. For each category a mapping of the scores was created. This appears as a hexagon indicating
progress in each area for which points are achieved.

percentage of points achieved within each sub-category within the category of environment. Source: D.
Fredman adapted from Lozano (2006) (p. 435).
Another example of visualizing sustainability is seen in a framework developed for universities to use
(Troschinetz et al., 2007 (p. 435)). Again, multidimensional sustainability indicators, each having an economic, environmental and social component are used. The categories are listed in Figure Sustainability
Indicator Triangle (Figure 9.9). Each indicator was examined using a sustainability indicator triangle
where each corner is delineated as economic, environmental or social and the indicators are placed within to
the triangle to reect how well each measures those aspects.

9.3.1.10 Conclusion
Measuring sustainability is dicult because of the interdisciplinary nature and complexity of the issues that
this concern represents. Methods have been developed out of the dierent disciplines that are based in
the ecological, economic, physical and social sciences. When approaching a measure of sustainability it is
important to understand what you will use the results of that measure for, what the major concerns you want
to address are, and the limits of the system you choose. Often it is more meaningful to measure progress of
the entity you are examining  is it more sustainable than it was before? It is dicult to compare similar
entities (countries, companies, institutions, even products) due to the complexity and variability in the data.
Using visualization to represent the data is a helpful way to show the state of sustainability rather than
trying to express it in one number or in a table of numbers.

SUSTAINABILITY
9.3.2 Footprinting: Carbon, Ecological and Water42
9.3.2.1 Footprinting: Carbon, Ecological and Water
9.3.2.1.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this section, students should be able to
• understand what an environmental footprint is and its limitations
• conduct some basic footprinting calculations
• calculate and explain their own footprint
9.3.2.1.2 Basic Concepts of Footprinting
What is a common measure of the impact of an individual, institution, region or nation? This can be done
by measuring the footprint of that entity. When discussing climate change and sustainability the concepts
of carbon footprint and ecological footprint are often used. Understanding how these footprints are derived
is important to the discourse as not all calculations are equal. These footprints can be calculated at the
individual or household level, the institutional level (corporation, university, and agency), municipal level,
sub-national, national or global. They are derived from the consumption of natural resources such as raw
materials, fuel, water, and power expressed in quantities or economic value. The quantity consumed is
translated into the footprint by using conversion factors generally based in scientic or economic values.
note: There are many personal calculators available on the internet. Here are a few to try:
• EPA Household Emissions Calculator43
• Ecological Footprint44
• Earth Day Network Footprint45
• Cool Climate Network (UC Berkeley)46
• Carbon Footprint47
This chapter will discuss three types of footprints  ecological, carbon and water  and the methodologies
behind them. Although eorts have been made to standardize the calculations comparisons must be approached with caution. Comparing individual, institutional or national footprints that are calculated by the
same method can be helpful in measuring change over time and understanding the factors that contribute
to the dierences in footprints.
9.3.2.1.3 Ecological Footprint
9.3.2.1.3.1 Concept
The Merriam-Webster Dictionary denes footprint48 as:
1. an impression of the foot on a surface;
2. the area on a surface covered by something

437
Similarly, the ecological footprint (EF) represents the area of land on earth that provides for resources
consumed and that assimilates the waste produced by a given entity or region. It is a composite index (see
Module Sustainability Metrics and Rating Systems (Section 9.3.1)) that represents the amount of biologically
productive land and water area required to support the demands of the population in that entity or region
The EF is benecial because it provides a single value (equal to land area required) that reects resource
use patterns (Costanza, 2000 (p. 450)). The use of EF in combination with a social and economic impact
assessment can provide a measure of sustainability's triple bottom line (Dawe, et al., 2004 (p. 450)). It
can help nd some of the hidden environmental costs of consumption that are not captured by techniques
such as cost-benet analysis and environmental impact (Venetoulis, 2001 (p. 450)). Using the ecological
footprint, an assessment can be made of from where the largest impact comes (Flint, 2001 (p. 450)).
Next, we will discuss the how an EF is calculated.
9.3.2.1.3.2 Methodology
The ecological footprint methodology was developed by William Rees and Mathis Wackernagel (p. 450)
(1996) (p. 450), and consists of two methodologies:
1. Compound calculation49 is typically used for calculations involving large regions and nations and
is shown in Figure Compound Calculation Steps for Ecological Footprint Analysis (p. 437). First,
it involves a consumption analysis of over 60 biotic resources including meat, dairy produce, fruit,
vegetables, pulses, grains, tobacco, coee, and wood products. That consumption is then divided by
biotic productivity (global average) for the type of land (arable, pasture, forest, or sea areas) and the
result represents the area needed to sustain that activity. The second part of the calculation includes
energy generated and energy embodied in traded goods. This is expressed in the area of forested land
needed to sequester CO2 emissions from both types of energy. Finally, equivalence factors are used
to weight the six ecological categories based on their productivity (arable, pasture, forest, sea, energy,
built-up land). The results are reported as global hectares (gha) where each unit is equal to one hectare
of biologically productive land based on the world's average productivity. We derive sub-national
footprints based on apportioning the total national footprint between sub-national populations. The
advantage of this method is that it captures many indirect of eects of consumption so the overall
footprint is more accurate.
2. Component-based calculation50 resembles life-cycle analysis in that it examines individual products
and services for their cradle-to-grave resource use and waste, and results in a factor for a certain unit
or activity. The footprint is typically broken down into categories that include energy, transportation,
water, materials and waste, built-up land, and food. This method is better for individuals or institutions
since it accounts for specic consumption within that entity. However, it probably under-counts as not
all activities and products could practically be measured or included. It also may double-count since
there may be overlap between products and services.

.
9.3.2.1.3.3 What the Results Show
When looking at the sub-national level, it is useful to be able to examine dierent activities that contribute
to the footprint such as energy, transportation, water, waste, and food. In both types of calculations, there is
a representation of the energy ecological footprint. We utilize conversion factors that account for direct land
use for mining the energy source and the land required to sequester any carbon emitted during combustion,
construction, or maintenance of the power source. It should be noted that no actual component-based
calculations have been done for nuclear power. The practice has been to consider it the same as coal so as
to account for it in some way. A discussion of the merits of this method can be found in Wackernagel et al.
(2005) (p. 450).
Transportation is another activity that can be examined at the sub-national level. The transportation
footprint maybe considered part of the energy footprint, or separately, but is basically based on the energy
consumption for transportation. It may also include some portion of the built-up land.
The hydroprint, or water-based footprint, measures the amount of water consumed in comparison to the
amount of water in the land catchment system for the geographical area being footprinted. It can represent
whether the entity is withdrawing more or less water than is naturally supplied to the area from rainfall.

The wasteprint, or waste-based footprint, is calculated using commonly used component-based factors
that have been calculated and compiled in a number of publications and books. Food production requires
energy to grow, process and transport, as well as land for growing and grazing. The factors are derived using
the compound calculation for a certain geographical area. See Case Study: Comparing Greenhouse Gas
Emissions, Ecological Footprint and Sustainability Rating of a University (Section 9.3.3) for an example of
this kind of ecological footprint analysis. This kind of analysis can show us how a nation, region, organization,
or individual uses the planets resources to support its operation or life style, as well as what activities are
the primary contributors to the footprint. In the next section, we will look at some national footprints.

Latvia has the lowest footprint displayed at 6.0 gha per person, with the majority of its footprint due to
forestland.

Figure United States' Ecological Footprint (p. 440) shows the national footprint in 2007 of the United
States as 7.99 gha per person both with a bar display and with specic metrics on the right that show the
exact footprint and the United States' ranking among all nations in the report (e.g. carbon is 5.57 gha and
ranks 3rd largest overall). The bar to the left expresses the world average. The United States' footprint
of 7.99 gha stands in contrast to the earth's global biocapacity of 1.8 gha per person. Globally, the total
population's footprint was 18 billion gha, or 2.7 gha per person. However, the earth's biocapacity was only
11.9 billion gha, or 1.8 gha per person. This represents an ecological demand of 50 percent more than the
earth can manage. In other words, it would take 1.5 years for the Earth to regenerate the renewable resources
that people used in 2007 and absorb CO2 waste. Thus, earth's population used the equivalent of 1.5 planets
in 2007 to support their lives.
9.3.2.1.4 Carbon Footprint
Since climate change (see Chapter Climate and Global Change) is one of the major focuses of the sustainability movement, measurement of greenhouse gases or carbon footprint is a key metric when addressing
this problem. A greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) inventory is a type of carbon footprint. Such an inventory
evaluates the emissions generated from the direct and indirect activities of the entity as expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents (see below). Since you cannot manage what you cannot measure, GHG reductions
cannot occur without establishing baseline metrics. There is increasing demand for regulatory and voluntary reporting of GHG emissions such as Executive Order 1351462 , requiring federal agencies to reduce
GHG emissions, the EPA's Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule63 for industry, the Securities and Exchange
Commission's climate change disclosure guidance64 , American College and University Presidents' Climate
Commitment65 (ACUPCC) for universities, ICLEI66 for local governments, the California Climate Action
Registry, and numerous corporate sustainability reporting initiatives.
9.3.2.1.4.1 Scoping the Inventory
The rst step in measuring carbon footprints is conducting an inventory is to determine the scope of the
inventory. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development67 (WBCSD) and the World Resource
Institute68 (WRI) dened a set of accounting standards that form the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG
Protocol). This protocol is the most widely used international accounting tool to understand, quantify,
and manage greenhouse gas emissions. Almost every GHG standard and program in the world uses this
framework as well as hundreds of GHG inventories prepared by individual companies and institutions. In
North America, the most widely used protocol was developed by The Climate Registry69
.
The GHG Protocol also oers developing countries an internationally accepted management tool to help
their businesses to compete in the global marketplace and their governments to make informed decisions
about climate change. In general, tools are either sector-specic (e.g. aluminum, cement, etc.) or crosssector tools for application to many dierent sectors (e.g. stationary combustion or mobile combustion).

SUSTAINABILITY

greenhouse gas emissions inventory. Source: New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development,
The challenges of greenhouse gas emissions: The why and how of accounting and reporting for GHG
emissions (2002, August), gure 3, p. 1070
.
The WRI protocol addresses the scope by which reporting entities can set boundaries (see Figure Scopes of
a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (Figure 9.13)). These standards are based on the source of emissions
in order to prevent counting emissions or credits twice. The three scopes are described below:
• Scope 1: Includes GHG emissions from direct sources owned or controlled by the institution  production of electricity, heat or steam, transportation or materials, products, waste, and fugitive emissions.
Fugitive emissions are due to intentional or unintentional release of GHGs including leakage of refrigerants from air conditioning equipment and methane releases from farm animals.
• Scope 2: Includes GHG emissions from imports (purchases) of electricity, heat or steam  generally
those associated with the generation that energy.
• Scope 3: Includes all other indirect sources of GHG emissions that may result from the activities of the
institution but occur from sources owned or controlled by another company, such as business travel;
outsourced activities and contracts; emissions from waste generated by the institution when the GHG
emissions occur at a facility controlled by another company, e.g. methane emissions from landlled
waste; and the commuting habits of community members.
Depending on the purpose of the inventory the scope may vary. For instance, the EPA mandatory reporting
requirements for large carbon dioxide sources require reporting of only Scope 1 emissions from stationary
sources. However, many voluntary reporting systems require accounting for all three scopes, such as the
ACUPCC reporting. Numerous calculator tools have been developed, some publicly available and some
proprietary. For instance many universities use a tool called the Campus Carbon Calculator71 developed
by Clean Air-Cool Planet72 , which is endorsed by the ACUPCC. Numerous northeastern universities collaborated to develop the Campus Carbon Calculator and the calculator has been used at more than 200

campuses in North America. It utilizes an electronic Microsoft Excel workbook that calculates estimated
GHG emissions from the data collected.
9.3.2.1.4.2 Methodology
GHG emissions calculations are generally calculated for the time period of one year. Figure Steps for
Preparing a GHG Emissions Report (Figure 9.14) shows the steps for reporting GHG emissions. It is
necessary to determine what the baseline year is for calculation. This is the year that is generally used to
compare future increases or decreases in emissions, when setting a GHG reduction goal. The Kyoto Protocol73
proposes accounting for greenhouse gas emissions from a baseline year of 1990. Sometimes calculations may
be made for the current year or back to the earliest year that data is available.

take when preparing a GHG emissions report. Source: C. Klein-Banai74
Next, the institutional or geographic boundaries need to be dened. Also, the gases that are being
reported should be dened. There are six greenhouse gases dened by the Kyoto Protocol. Some greenhouse
gases, such as carbon dioxide, occur naturally and are emitted to the atmosphere through natural and
anthropogenic processes. Other greenhouse gases (e.g. uorinated gases) are created and emitted solely

SUSTAINABILITY
through human activities. The principal greenhouse gases that enter the atmosphere because of human
activities are:
• Carbon Dioxide (CO2)75 : Carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere through the combustion of
fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), solid waste, trees and wood products, and also as a result of
non-combustion reactions (e.g. manufacture of cement). Carbon dioxide is sequestered when plants
absorb it as part of the biological carbon cycle.
• Methane (CH4)76 : Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas,
and oil. Methane emissions also come from farm animals and other agricultural practices and the
degradation of organic waste in municipal solid waste landlls.
• Nitrous Oxide (N2O)77 : Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities, and
combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste.
• Fluorinated Gases78 : Hydrouorocarbons, peruorocarbons, and sulfur hexauoride are synthetic,
powerful greenhouse gases that are emitted from a variety of industrial processes. Fluorinated gases
are sometimes used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances79 (i.e. Chlorouorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorouorocarbon (HCFCs), and halons). CFCs and HCFCs are gases comprised of chloride,
uoride, hydrogen, and carbon. Halons are elemental gases that include chlorine, bromine, and uorine.
These gases are typically emitted in smaller quantities, but because they are potent greenhouse gases,
they are sometimes referred to as High Global Warming Potential gases (High GWP gases).
Each gas, based on its atmospheric chemistry, captures dierent amounts of reected heat thus contributing
dierently to the greenhouse eect, which is known as its global warming potential. Carbon dioxide, the
least capture ecient of these gases, acts as the reference gas with a global warming potential of 1. Table
Global Warming Potentials (Table 9.5: Global Warming Potentials) shows the global warming potential for
the various GHGs.

GHG emissions cannot be easily measured since they come from both mobile and stationary sources.
Therefore, emissions must be calculated. Emissions are usually calculated using the formula:
A × Fg = E (9.14)
where A is the quantication of an activity in units that can be combined with emission factor of greenhouse
gas g (Fg) to obtain the resulting emissions for that gas (Eg).
Examples of activity units include mmbtu (million British Thermal Units) of natural gas, gallons of
heating oil, kilowatt hours of electricity, and miles traveled. Total GHG emissions can be expressed as the
sum of the emissions for each gas multiplied by its global warming potential (GWP). GHG emissions are
usually reported in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (metric tons CO2-e):
GHG =
X
g
Eg∆GWPg(9.14)
Eg is usually estimated from the quantity of fuel burned using national and regional average emissions
factors, such as those provided by the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration82

Emission factors can be based on government documents and software from the U.S. Department of Transportation83 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)84 , and the U.S. Department of Energy85
,
or from specic characteristics of the fuel used  such as higher heating value and carbon content. Scope 3
emissions that are based on waste, materials, and commuting are more complex to calculate. Various calculators use dierent inputs to do this and the procedures are less standardized. See Case Study: Comparing
Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Ecological Footprint and Sustainability Rating of a University (Section 9.3.3)
for an example of these kinds of calculations.
Greenhouse gas emissions inventories are based on standardized practice and include the steps of scoping,
calculating, and reporting. They are not based on actual measurements of emissions, rather on calculations
based on consumption of greenhouse gas generating materials such as fossil fuels for provision of energy and
transportation or emissions from waste disposal. They can be conducted for buildings, institutions, cities,
regions, and nations.
9.3.2.1.4.3 Carbon Footprint Comparisons
Comparison of carbon footprints reveal interesting dierences between countries, particularly when compared
to their economic activity. The World Bank86 tracks data on countries and regions throughout the world as
part of their mission to ght poverty. . .and to help people help themselves and their environment (World

emissions and gross domestic product for various regions of the world. It is interesting to note that the
United States' emissions per capita (19.34 mt e-CO2) are more than four times the world average. The

9.3.2.1.5 Water Footprint
The water footprint of production is the volume of freshwater used by people to produce goods, measured
over the full supply chain, as well as the water used in households and industry, specied geographically
and temporally. This is slightly dierent from the hydroprint described above which simply compares the
consumption of water by a geographic entity to the water that falls within its watershed. If you look at the
hydrologic cycle (see module Water Cycle and Fresh Water Supply (Section 5.2)), water moves through the
environment in various ways. The water footprint considers the source of the water as three components:
• Green water footprint: The volume of rainwater that evaporates during the production of goods; for
agricultural products, this is the rainwater stored in soil that evaporates from crop elds.
• Blue water footprint: The volume of freshwater withdrawn from surface or groundwater sources that is
used by people and not returned; in agricultural products this is mainly accounted for by evaporation
of irrigation water from elds, if freshwater is being drawn.
• Grey water footprint: the volume of water required to dilute pollutants released in production processes
to such an extent that the quality of the ambient water remains above agreed water quality standards.
The water footprint of an individual is based on the direct and indirect water use of a consumer. Direct
water use is from consumption at home for drinking, washing, and watering. Indirect water use results from
the freshwater that is used to produce goods and services purchased by the consumer. Similarly, the water
footprint of a business or institution is calculated from the direct and indirect water consumption.

Figure Water Footprint of Production of Select Countries (Figure 9.15) shows the water footprint of
production for several countries as a whole. In this report, due to lack of data, one unit of return ow is
assumed to pollute one unit of freshwater. Given the negligible volume of water that evaporates during
domestic and industrial processes, as opposed to agriculture, only the grey water footprint for households
and industry was included. This gure does not account for imports and exports it is only based on the
country in which the activities occurred not where they were consumed.
In contrast, the water footprint of a nation accounts for all the freshwater used to produce the goods
and services consumed by the inhabitants of the country. Traditionally, water demand (i.e. total water
withdrawal for the various sectors of economy) is used to demonstrate water demand for production within a
nation. The internal water footprint is the volume of water used from domestic water resources; the external
water footprint is the volume of water used in other countries to produce goods and services imported
and consumed by the inhabitants of the country. The average water footprint for the United States was
calculated to be 2480m3/cap/yr, while China has an average footprint of 700m3/cap/yr. The global average
water footprint is 1240m3/cap/yr. As for ecological footprints there are several major factors that determine
the water footprint of a country including the volume of consumption (related to the gross national income);
consumption pattern (e.g. high versus low meat consumption); climate (growth conditions); and agricultural
practice (water use eciency) (Hoekstra & Chapagain, 2007 (p. 450)).

otherwise not be utilized to grow a crop and the revenue from the product contributes to the economy
of that country. At the same time, the result is that many countries are importing water to support the
products they consume.

The water footprint reveals that much more water is consumed to make a product than appears in using
a simple calculation. It is not just the water content of the product but includes all water used in the process
to make it and to manage the waste generated from that process.
9.3.2.1.6 Summary
Footprinting tools can be useful ways to present and compare environmental impact. They are useful because
they can combine impacts from various activities into one measure. However, they have limitations. For
instance, in a carbon footprint or greenhouse gas emissions inventory, many of the conventional environmental impacts such as hazardous waste, wastewater, water consumption, stormwater, and toxic emissions
are not accounted for, nor are the impacts of resource consumption such as paper, food, and water generally
measured. Perhaps most importantly, certain low-carbon fuel sources (e.g. nuclear power) that have other
environmental impacts (e.g. nuclear waste) are neglected. Finally, the scope of the emissions inventory does
not include upstream emissions from the manufacture or transport of energy or materials. This suggests
that there is a need to go beyond just GHG emissions analyses when evaluating sustainability and include
all forms of energy and their consequences.
The ecological footprint can be misleading when it is looked at in isolation, for instance with an urban
area, the resources needed to support it will not be provided by the actual geographic area since food must
be imported and carbon oset by natural growth that does not t in a city. However, cities have many
other eciencies and advantages that are not recognized in an ecological footprint. When looked at on a
national level it can represent the inequities that exist between countries.
It is interesting to contrast the water and ecological footprints, as well. The water footprint explicitly
considers the actual location of the water use, whereas the ecological footprint does not consider the place
of land use. Therefore it measures the volumes of water use at the various locations where the water

is appropriated, while the ecological footprint is calculated based on a global average land requirement per
consumption category. When the connection is made between place of consumption and locations of resource
use, the consumer's responsibility for the impacts of production at distant locations is made evident.

9.3.3.1 Case Study: Comparing Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Ecological Footprint and Sustainability Rating of a University
How do dierent measures of sustainability compare when looking at one institution? This case study
compares these dierent measures for the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Located just southwest of
downtown Chicago, UIC has 13 colleges serving 27,000 students and 12,000 employees, with over 100 buildings
on 240 acres (97 hectares) of land. The activities of the faculty, sta and students and the buildings and
grounds have an impact on the sustainability of the institution. This case study will look at the results of
the greenhouse gas emission inventory, ecology footprint, and sustainability rating.

the Chicago area. However, until August of 2009, UIC purchased electricity from Commonwealth Edison
which has a much lower greenhouse gas emissions factor due to the high percentage of nuclear power in the
Chicago region.
UIC operates two combined heat and power plants. However, the university has increasingly lowered its
production of electricity from natural gas by purchasing more electricity through block purchases (for dened
amounts of electricity for a certain period of time) due to the relatively low cost of purchasing electricity
as compared to self-generating. This strategy has increased UIC's emissions as the regional mix has a fair
amount of coal-powered plants providing electricity. Neverthless, a downward trend in emissions is beginning
in spite of the increased electricity purchases between 2009 and 2010. This may be due to overall reduction
in energy consumption on campus, which is reducing the GHG emissions.
Figure Breakdown of UIC's Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Figure 9.17) illustrates the relative contribution
to UIC's 2010 emissions prole, with 77 percent of emissions coming from buildings (power plants, purchased
electricity, and other on-campus stationary, i.e. natural gas supply to the buildings), 20 percent due to
transportation (campus eet , commuting to campus, and air travel), and less than one percent for emissions
due to waste sent to the landll (which generates methane).

9.3.4 Food Miles109
9.3.4.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand what food miles are and why they are used.
• compare the strengths and limitations of the use of food miles.
• explore the implications of food miles in decision-making strategies.
9.3.4.2 Introduction
Eorts to explore the impacts of the items on our dinner tables led to the broad concept of food miles
(the distance food travels from production to consumption) as being a quick and convenient way to compare products. With increasing globalization, our plates have progressively included food items from other
continents. Previously it would have been too expensive to transport these products. However, changes to
agricultural practices, transportation infrastructure, and distribution methods now mean that people in the
United States can start the day with coee from Brazil, have a pasta lunch topped with Italian cheeses, snack
on chocolate from Côte d'Ivoire, and end with a dinner of Mediterranean bluen tuna and Thai rice. However, the globalization that has led to increased availability of these products comes with associated costs,
such as the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, increased trac congestion, lack of support
for local economies, less fresh food, and decreased food security. Therefore, the concept of measuring food
miles was meant to provide an easy comparison of the relative impacts of our food choices.
Many individuals, groups, and businesses today measure or calculate food miles. But, when Andrea
Paxton, a U.K.-based environmental activist, coined the term in the 1990s the concept of food miles was
intended to encompass more than simply a distance. The point was to broaden awareness that our food
choices have consequences that are often not apparent. Consumers frequently do not know the histories behind their food purchases, and markets often cannot supply the information because of the many production
processes and distribution methods used.
While the distance food travels does determine some of the environmental, social, and economic impacts,
there can be other hidden consequences not so easily measured. Exploration of the utility of food miles in
the general sense of knowing the impacts of our purchasing decisions has resulted in a broadening awareness
of the complexity of globalization. Although consumers can use the easy-to-compare numbers representing
food miles, that metric cannot reect all of the impacts of food purchasing decisions.
9.3.4.3 Calculating Food Miles
In some cases it is easy to use food miles, such as comparing two watermelons grown using the same methods
and both transported by truck to your store. However, many of our food products contain components with
dierent origins. In that case, food miles are calculated as a weighted average to create a single number that
takes into consideration the weight and distance of each item. For example, to calculate the food miles for a
simple fruit salad that contains only apples, bananas, and honey, you need to know the distance that each
ingredient traveled to reach your market and the relative amount of each product. Figure Food Miles for
Fruit Salad (Figure 9.18) illustrates the food miles for this simple fruit salad.

dierent distances to Illinois' supermarkets. Source. D. Ruez adapated from TUBS110, akarlovic111
,

Most of our food from supermarkets is marked with a country or state of origin. That alone is usually
enough to get an estimate of the distance, especially if the location can be narrowed down by nding out the
part of the country or state that most commonly produces the product. If the fruit salad in Figure Food
Miles for Fruit Salad (Figure 9.18) is being made in Chicago, Illinois, and the apples are from the state
of Washington, the likely origin is in the center part of the state. The travel distance is approximately 2,000
miles (3,219 km). Bananas from Costa Rica traveled about 2,400 miles (3,862 km) to Chicago, and there
are honey producers only 160 miles (257 km) from Chicago. A simple average of the miles the ingredients
traveled would not take into account that the fruit salad probably would not contain equal amounts of the
three items. If the recipe called for 2 pounds (.9 kg) of apples, 2 pounds (.9 kg) of bananas, and a ¼ pound
(.1 kg) of honey, the miles would be weighted toward the distances traveled by the fruit: 2080 food miles
per pound of fruit salad (or 3,347 km/kg of fruit salad).

9.3.4.4 Benets
The benets of using food miles in evaluating food choices match the three main categories that represent
sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. All methods of transporting food over long distances,
and most methods used to transport over short distances, involve fossil fuels. Burning of fossil fuels creates
greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Using fossil fuels also results in the emission of other
gases and particulates that degrade air quality. Longer transportation distances intensify trac congestion,
resulting in lost productivity, and increase the need for more extensive infrastructure (such as more highways)
that negatively impact the environment by increasing the amount of impervious cover and by requiring
more natural resources. Increased roadways also encourage sprawl, leading to more inecient development
patterns. Finally, trac congestion and air pollution from driving contribute to an estimated 900,000
fatalities per year worldwide.
Use of food miles is often tied to locavore movements, which emphasizes consumption of locally-grown
food products. Local food is usually fresher, with harvesting waiting until produce is ripe, and has less
processing and fewer preservatives. Many people think locally-grown food tastes better, but others chose
to be a locavore because it strengthens local cultural identity or because the safety of the food is being
controlled by people who also consume the products themselves. Eating local foods also promotes food
security because availability and price of imported foods is more dependent on uctuating fuel costs and
sociopolitical conicts elsewhere.
The production of food in developing countries, and the subsequent exporting of those products, has
several types of impacts. The environmental burden of soil degradation, water depletion, and others, are
imposed on developing countries, while more prosperous countries enjoy the benets. This can be especially
problematic because some developing countries do not have the policies to require, or the resources to
implement, more environmentally-friendly food production practices. In particular, the low prices paid to
food producers in developing countries do not include sucient funds, or requirements, for practices to
preserve or restore ecosystem quality. Moreover, developing countries disproportionately suer malnutrition,
yet the success of large-scale transport of food encourages cultivation of products to be exported instead of
planting nutritious foods to be self-sustaining.
Some businesses are embracing the basic concepts of food miles because transporting food over shorter
distances uses less fuel, and is therefore cheaper. Additionally, food that covers longer distances usually
requires more packaging, which adds to the cost. By focusing on local foods, local economies are supported.
This has led to clearer labeling of food products, giving consumers the ability to make more informed
decisions about their purchases.
9.3.4.5 Criticism
Although the concept of food miles is useful, it has been heavily criticized for being too simplistic. For
example, all miles are not created equally. The consumption of fuel varies by the mode of transportation and
the amount being moved. If you compare the consumption required to move one pound of a product, ocean
freighters are the most ecient of the common methods, followed by trains, trucks, and nally planes. When
a combination of transportation methods is used, making a comparison with food miles becomes even more
complex. This is especially a problem because most of us drive a personal vehicle to get our groceries. That
means that it may be more ecient (from a total fuel consumption perspective) to drive 1 mile (1.6 km) to a
local supermarket who imports beef from Australia, than to drive 40 miles (64 km) to visit a market selling
locally-produced beef.
Food miles also do not take into consideration the variables of production before the products are transported. Growing outdoors requires dierent amounts of energy input than greenhouses. A commonly cited
example is that of tomatoes; heating greenhouses to grow tomatoes in the United Kingdom consumes much
more energy than growing tomatoes in warm Spain and importing them. Use of chemical fertilizers and
pesticides aect environmental quality and production levels dierently than organic farming. Because soil
quality varies, locally-grown foods, in some cases, require more of the chemical additives. Some areas may
have newer equipment, better climate, increased access to water, or other factors that determine the overall

458 CHAPTER 9. PROBLEM-SOLVING, METRICS, AND TOOLS FOR
SUSTAINABILITY
eciency of food production. Growing rice in deserts or oranges in the Arctic would have more environmental impacts than the transportation of those products from locales where they can be grown more eciently
(from both an environmental and economic perspective). Understanding these production variables is critical because several recent studies have suggested that as much as 80% of greenhouse-gas generation from
food consumption comes from the production phase. See References (Section 9.3.4.9: References) for further
reading.
There are also benets to globalization and increased transport of food. There is now more widespread
access to a broader range of food products. This can lead to increased appreciation for other cultures
and greater international cooperation. Long-distance transport of food products can also provide jobs to
developing nations by giving them access to larger, more prosperous markets internationally. Jobs and
economic incentives from food production are some of the few widespread opportunities for developing
countries, and these may lead to growth in other economic areas.
Criticism of the use of food miles can be unfairly disapproving of products that travel long distances.
However, simple calculations of food miles have also been said to underrepresent the importance of travel
distances. Most food is transported with some packaging, and that packaging also requires energy input for
its production and transport. Because products that move shorter distances usually have less packaging,
the dierence in calculated food miles may underestimate the actual environmental impact. Local foods
also require less energy and resource consumption because of reduced need for transportation infrastructure,
chemical additives and preservatives, and refrigeration.
The impacts during the production phase also vary between types of foods, which can also result in
underestimates of the impacts. Production of meats, especially red meats, requires large amounts of land to
generate the crops needed for animal feed. Because not all energy is passed from feed to the animal, using
meats for our food is inecient from an energy perspective. It takes over 8 pounds of grain to feed a cow
enough to generate 1 pound of weight gain. That grain must be grown on land that can long longer produce
food directly for human consumption. The amount of land required to produce animal feed is known as
ghost acres. Ghost acres also extend to the areas required to provide the fuel, water, and other resources
needed for animal feed, and for the overall support of animals114. While some other meats such as pork,
poultry, and especially sh, use proportionally less feed, there are other concerns about the environmental
impacts of diets with large amounts of meat.
Conned animal feeding operations (CAFOs), high-density animal farms, have become the primary
source of livestock for meat in the U.S., Europe, and many other countries. The technological innovations
employed in these operations have increased the speed and volume of meat production, but have raised health
concerns. Antibiotics and hormones used increasingly on animals in CAFOs may be passed on to humans
during consumption, even though there is currently no way of knowing a safe level of those substances in
our diets. The overuse of antibiotics in CAFOs also results in antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In addition to
the impacts from the ghost acres, there are other ecological impacts such as pollution from massive amounts
of concentrated manure. Although the distance meat is transported has an environmental impact, the other
concerns are more signicant.
114In other environmental contexts, ghost acres refer more broadly to all land areas being used indirectly to support human
activity and areas not usable due to other human inuences

9.3.4.6 Implementation
The ongoing investigations of food miles have aected businesses, groups, and individuals in various ways. As
mentioned above, paying closer attention to the distance food travels can be a good business strategy because
fuel costs money. Centralization of processing and distribution centers in the United States has resulted in
a relative frequent occurrence of shipping produce thousands of miles only to end up in supermarkets back
near its origin. In many cases the initial savings from building fewer centralized facilities is exceeded in the
long-term by the continual shipping costs. As a result, some retailers are encouraging outside scrutiny of
their habits, because it can result in increased prots. At the other extreme, the rise in food miles in some
cases is driven entirely by money. Fish caught oshore Norway and the United Kingdom, for example, is
sent to China for cheaper processing before being returned to European markets.
An awareness of the impact of food miles has led to many groups advocating local foods. Local farmers'
markets have appeared and expanded around the United States and elsewhere, providing increased access
to fresh foods. Community-supported agriculture programs create share-holders out of consumers,

security. Campaigns by community groups are inuencing retailers and restaurants by scrutinizing the foodpurchasing decisions. The reciprocal is also true as retailers and restaurants advertise their sustainability
eorts. See Resources (Section 9.3.4.10: Resources for locating farmers' markets in Illinois:) for examples of
local farmers' markets in Illinois.

Yet, there are challenges to the implementation of food miles as a concept. Suppliers, such as individual
farmers, might opt for the reliable annual purchase from a mass-distributor. Consumers might make decisions
solely on the sticker price, not knowing the other impacts, or consumers might know the impacts but choose
the immediate economic incentive. Some of these challenges can be addressed by education. This can include
eorts such as eco-labeling  labels, often by third parties, that independently attest to the environmental
claims of products. This can inuence some consumers, but larger buyers like school systems and restaurant
chains may require other incentives to change purchasing practices. The source of these incentives, or
alternatively, regulations, might come from government agencies, especially those with desires to support
local economies. However, there is no consensus regarding who should be evaluating and monitoring food
miles.

9.3.4.7 Summary
The criticisms of food miles are valid, and work is continually being done incorporate the many factors
that more completely show the environmental impacts of transporting food. This can be a time consuming
process, and the many variables are usually not readily available to consumers. A frozen pizza might contain
many types of ingredients from various areas that are transported to individual processing plants before
being assembled in another location and forwarded to distribution centers before being shipped to stores.
Even if this process is eventually simplied, eating decisions should not be made solely on the basis of food
miles, which cannot account for the variations in transportation and production methods or the social and
economic impacts.
This does not mean that food miles are never a useful tool. When comparing similar products (e.g.,
onions to onions) with other similar externalities (e.g., production and transportation methods), food miles
provide a convenient way for consumers to begin to make informed decisions about their purchases. Even
though food transportation is a relatively small portion of the overall impact of our food consumption,
changes to any phase of the process can have a positive additive eect and make a real contribution to
environmental health. Moreover, most of the benets for using food miles can likewise apply to many of our
non-food purchases, with allowances for some of the same drawbacks. Additionally, the discussion could be
expanded to include other kinds of decisions, such as where to live in relation to location of job, and where to
take a vacation. In general, the concept of food miles reects the need to understand how hidden inuences
generate environmental, social, and economic impacts.

9.3.5 Environmental Performance Indicators121
9.3.5.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the data included in creating an environmental performance indicator
• be able to state some general strengths and weaknesses of the environmental sustainability index and
emergy performance index
• know the dierences between some of the major environmental performance indicators
9.3.5.2 Introduction
Because there are so many types of environmental problems, there are many projects designed to address
these concerns and likewise many methods to assess them. Collectively, the methods for assessing environmental impactsand the uses of natural resources (both living and non-living) are called environmental
performance indicators. Generally, performance indicators are used in elds ranging from marketing and
economics to education and legal studies to measure a project's progress and/or success. Some indicators
can evaluate the actions of a single individual, while others are broad enough to reect the eorts of entire
nations or even the globe. Specically, environmental performance indicators (EPIs) examine environmental issues such as pollution, biodiversity, climate, energy, erosion, ecosystem services, environmental
education, and many others. Without these EPIs, the success or failure of even the most well-intentioned
actions can remain hidden.
Because of the diversity of observational scales and topics, not all EPIs are useful in all scenarios. However,
all EPIs should indicate whether the state of the environment is changed positively or negatively, and they
should provide a measure of that change. An EPI is also more meaningful if it can quantify the results to
facilitate comparison between dierent types of activities. But before an EPI is selected, targets and baselines
must be clearly articulated. Vague targets are dicult to evaluate, and the results may be uninformative.
The EPI selected must use indicators that are denitively linked to the targets, are reliable and repeatable,
and can be generated in a cost and time ecient manner.
To evaluate an activity, an EPI needs to include information from up to four types of indicators: inputs,
outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Inputs are the natural resources or ecosystem services being used.
Outputs are the goods or services that result from that activity. While outputs can often be quantied,
outcomes typically cannot be and instead represent environmental, social, and economic dimensions of wellbeing. In some cases it is useful to think of outcomes as why an output was sought; however, outcomes can
also be unanticipated or unwanted eects of an output. Impacts refer to the longer-term and more extensive
results of the outcomes and outputs, and can include the interaction of the latter two indicators.
For example, coal can be an input for an electricity-generating plant because we need the output (electricity) to turn on lights in our homes. Two outcomes would include the ability to read at night because of
the electricity and the visible air pollution from the power plant smoke stacks. An impact of being able to
read more can be a better-educated person, while an impact of the greenhouse gas emissions from burning
coal is increased potential for global climate change. This is a simplistic example which does not include the
majority of relevant indicators (inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts) for a complete and more meaningful
analysis.

463
We can then evaluate each of the indicators. Is the input (coal) an appropriate choice? Is there enough
for the practice of burning it to continue? Are there problems, such as political instability that could
interrupt continued access? Does the output (electricity) suciently address the problem (in this case,
energy for turning on lights)? Is the output produced and delivered in a timely manner? Is it provided
to the appropriate consumers and in a quantity that is large enough? Does the output create the desired
outcome (being able to read at night)? Does it also result in unwanted outcomes (air pollution)? Do the
outcomes result in long-term impacts (such as life-long learning or decade-long climate change) that are
widespread?
Note that outcomes and impacts can be either positive or negative. The strength of an EPI lies in
its ability to look at the bigger picture and include multiple variables  particularly with regard to the
impacts. However, whether an impact is considered meaningful depends on the values and perspectives of
the individuals and groups involved. Judgment plays a role because of the diculty in comparing completely
dierent impacts. How do you compare life-long learning and climate change in the above example about
the use of coal?
9.3.5.3 Uses
Monitoring the impacts of both short-term and long-term activities with EPIs allows decision makers to
make changes that result in performance with lesser environmental impacts. In some cases, changes can be
made to ongoing projects, or the results of an EPI can be used for publicity if the performance data indicate
the activity is environmentally-sound. In other cases, the EPI establishes a performance benchmark against
which other projects are measured, or the results are used in the strategic planning phase while projects are
in development. In this way, past successes and failures can both be incorporated into future plans.
Use of EPIs requires production of multiple data points. A single application of an EPI does not mean
much until placed into a larger context. For example, an EPI might evaluate the impact of your city's
recycling eorts (see Figure Municipal Solid Waste Recycling Rates (Figure 9.21)), but that result can
be dicult to interpret without additional data that can be presented in multiple ways:
• Absolute values: Is the impact greater or less than that of other cities? How does the total cost of the
recycling program compare?
• Normalized values: How does the per person impact compare to another city, country, business, etc.?
What is the amount of aluminum recycled per dollar spent on recycling?
• Trends: Is your city improving, or is the progress your city sees in recycling better than that that
of other cities? This could be asked of either absolute or normalized data: Is the total amount of
aluminum recycled in your city increasing? Is the per-person amount of aluminum recycled in your
city increasing?

9.3.5.4 Major EPI Areas
Most EPIs focus on one or a few categories of environmental problems and do not attempt to be all-inclusive
methods of evaluating sustainability. A few of the more common categories are briey described below.
Biodiversity is the number and variety of forms of life, and can be calculated for a particular tree, an
ecosystem, a nation, or even the planet. Food, fuel, recreation, and other ecosystem services are dependent
on maintaining biodiversity. However, biodiversity is threatened by overuse and habitat destruction (see
Figure Endangered Animals (Figure 9.22)). Because the actual number of species alive is not known,
biodiversity indicators often use proxy data. These include patterns of habitat preservation and resource
use, because they are the primary factors inuencing biodiversity. The better-known groups of organisms,
such as birds and mammals, are also monitored for a direct count of biodiversity, but vertebrates are a tiny
proportion of life and cannot accurately reect changes in all species.

Wood is harvested for timber and fuel, but forests are also cleared for agricultural elds and housing
developments. Such deforestation frequently leads to rapid soil erosion and extinctions. Cutting of forests
also results in changes to the water cycle, altering precipitation patterns and rates, and nutrient cycles, such
as the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. At the same time as deforestation takes its toll in
places, trees are being planted elsewhere. Developed countries are increasing their forested areas, but this
is commonly being done at the expense of developing countries, which are exporting their wood (see Figure
Deforestation at the Haiti/Dominican Republic Border (Figure 9.23)). Forestry indicators in EPIs
include the annual change in forested areas, but can be broken down into the types of forests because each
has dierent environmental impacts. Another indicator is the use of non-sustainable wood resources. Tree
farms and some harvesting methods provide renewable supplies of wood, while clear-cutting tropical forests
does not. Irresponsible wood harvesting produces negative results for ecosystem health.

Air, water, and land pollution directly, and adversely, impacts human and ecosystem health. It also has
economic consequences from the damage of natural resources and human structures. In many cases the level
of pollutants can be measured either in the environment or at the point of emissions. Additional indicators
include whether pollution monitoring even occurs, to what extent legal maximum levels are enforced, and
whether regulations are in place to clean up the damage. Visit the EPA's MyEnvironment125 application to
learn more about environmental issues in your area.
Greenhouse gas emissions and ozone depletion are results of air pollution, but are frequently placed
in a separate category because they have global impacts regardless of the source of the problem. Levels
of greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere can be measured directly, or their
impacts can be measured by looking at temperature change and the size of the ozone hole. However, those
methods are rarely part of EPIs because they do not assign a particular source. Instead, EPIs include the
actual emissions by a particular process or area.

9.3.5.5 Examples of EPIs
There are dozens of EPIs that can be used to evaluate sustainability. Below are two examples of multicomponent methods that allow comparisons at a national level, which is necessary for promoting many types
of systemic change.
9.3.5.5.1 Environmental Sustainability Index
The environmental sustainability index (ESI) was created as a joint eort of Yale and Columbia
universities in order to have a way to compare the sustainability eorts and abilities of countries. Visit the
ESI website126 for more information such as maps and data. First presented in 2000 at the World Economic
Forum, the ESI has quickly gained popularity because it aids decision-making by providing clear comparisons
of environmental statistics. The basic assumption of the ESI is that sustainable development, the use of
resources in a way to meet societal, economic, and environmental demands for the long-term, requires a
multi-faceted approach. Specically, the ESI uses 76 variables to create 21 indicators of sustainability.
The indicators cover ve categories, with each description below indicating the condition that is more
sustainable:
• environmental systems  maintaining and improving ecosystem health
• reducing environmental stress  reducing anthropogenic stress on the environment
• reducing human vulnerability  having fewer negative impacts on people from the environment
• capacity to respond to environmental challenges  fostering social infrastructures that establish ability
and desire to respond eectively to environmental challenges
• global stewardship eorts  cooperating with other countries to address environmental problems.
The ESI scores range from 0, least sustainable, to 100, most sustainable, and is an equally-weighted average
of the 21 individual indicators. The highest-ranked countries in 2005 (Finland, Norway, Uruguay, Sweden,
and Iceland) all had in common abundant natural resources and low human-population densities. At the
other extreme, the lowest-ranked countries (North Korea, Iraq, Taiwan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) had
fewer natural resources, particularly when compared per capita, and have made policy decisions often against
their own long-term best interests. However, it is important to note that most countries do not excel, or fail,
with regard to all 21 indicators; every nation has room for improvement. Each country will also have its own
environmental priorities, attitudes, opportunities, and challenges. For example, the United States scores
high in the capacity to respond to environmental challenges, but low in actually reducing environmental
stress.
ESI scores have sparked some healthy competition between nations; no one wants to be seen as underperforming compared to their peers. After the pilot ESI rankings in 2000 and the rst full ESI rankings in
2002, Belgium, Mexico, the Philippines, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates, all initiated major
internal reviews that resulted in the initiation of eorts to improve environmental sustainability. Because
ESI data are presented not only as an overall average but also as 21 independent indicators, countries can
focus their eorts where most improvement could be made. Countries dissatised with their rankings have
also begun to make more of their environmental data accessible. Initial rankings by ESI score had missing
or estimated data in many cases, but by making more data available, more accurate overall assessments are
possible. For example, the Global Environmental Monitoring System Water Program, an important source
of water quality information, had data contributions increase from less than 40 countries to over 100 as a
result of the ESI.
Several similar ranking methodologies have emerged from the ESI. They vary in the number and type
of variables included and indicators produced. Some also calculate an overall average by weighting some
indicators more than others. However, they all share the same 0-100 scale and have individual indicators
that allow targeted improvement of the overall scores.

468 CHAPTER 9. PROBLEM-SOLVING, METRICS, AND TOOLS FOR
SUSTAINABILITY
9.3.5.5.2 Emergy Performance Index
One drawback of the ESI is that the indicators measure items as dierent as percentage of endangered
animals, recycling rates, government corruption, and child mortality rates. The scope of the variables has
been criticized because they may not be comparable in importance, and many others could be added. The
term, emergy, is a contraction of EMbodied enERGY. The emergy performance index (EMPI) diers
in omitting the social variables, and instead creates a single unit that can be used to describe the production
and use of any natural or anthropogenic resource.
The rst step of calculating EMPI is to inventory all material and energy inputs and outputs for all
processes and services. Every process and service is then converted to its equivalent in emergy. The amounts
of emergy of each type are summed. There are several possible ways to group emergy by type and to combine
the data, but generally the goal is to create either a measure of emergy renewability (as an indicator of stress
on the environment) or emergy sustainability (which combines renewability with the total productivity and
consumption or emergy).
Calculating the emergy equivalents of materials and energy can be done easily with a conversion table,
but creating the table can be a challenge. Burning coal releases an amount of energy that is easy to measure
and easy to convert to emergy. However, determining the amount of energy required to create coal is nearly
impossible. Similarly, how can you quantify the emergy conversion factor for objects like aluminum or for
ecosystem services like rainfall? It is dicult, but possible, to place a dollar value on those objects and
services, but assigning an energy equivalent is even more tenuous. While converting everything to a common
unit, emergy, simplies comparisons of diverse activities and processes like soil erosion and tourism, there
are concerns about the accuracy of those conversions.
9.3.5.6 Comparisons
There are no perfect measures of sustainability, and dierent indicators can sometimes give conicting
results. In particular this happens when perspectives on the most important components of sustainability,
and the methods to address them, dier. Therefore, it is often useful to examine the main characteristics of
several Environmental Performance Indicators to nd the one most appropriate for a particular study. As
an example, ESIs, EMPIs, and ecological footprinting (discussed in a previous section) are compared below.
Ecological footprinting (EF) has units that are the easiest to understand  area of land. Both EF and
EMPI employ only a single type of unit, allowing for use of absolute variables and permitting quantitative
comparisons. However, EF does not use multiple indicators to allow for focused attention on impacts. EMPI
can also be used as scaled values (such as the proportion of emergy from renewable sources), in the same
manner as ESI. However, ESI combines multiple units of measurements, which can provide a more holistic
perspective, but at the same time leads to concerns about combining those data.
Of the three, ESI and EMPI take into account wastefulness and recycling, and only ESI includes the
eects of all emissions. But while ESI includes the most variables, it is the most complex to calculate; the
simplest to calculate is EF.
Because ESI includes social and economic indicators, it can only compare nations (or in some cases,
states or other levels of governments). EF and EMPI are eective at comparing countries, but can also be
used at scales from global down to individual products.
All three of the EPIs compared here can be useful, but each has their limitations. Additionally, there
are scenarios where none of these are useful. Specic environmental education projects, for example, would
require dierent types of performance indicators.

9.3.6 Case Study: UN Millennium Development Goals Indicator129
In 2000 the United Nations created the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)130 to monitor and improve
human conditions by the year 2015. This framework was endorsed by all UN member nations and includes
goals in eight areas: hunger/poverty, universal primary education, gender equity, infant mortality, maternal
health, disease, global partnerships, and environmental sustainability.
Each of the MDGs on basic human rights has one or more targets, with each target having specic
indicators for assessment. Most of the targets have a baseline year of 1990 and specify an achievement
rate. For example, one target is to halve the proportion of people suering from hunger. By specifying a
proportion, targets can be monitored separately at national, regional, and global levels. Visit the interactive
map at MDGMonitor131 to track and monitor progress of the Millennium Development Goals.
The underlying principle of the MDGs is that the world has sucient knowledge and resources to implement sustainable practices to improve the life of everyone. Annual progress reports suggest that this
principle may be realistic only for some targets. The targets within environmental sustainability are the
implementation of national policies of sustainable development, increased access to safe drinking water, and
improvements to urban housing. There are success stories: eorts to increase availability of clean water
have resulted in improvements faster than expected. However, not all indicators are showing improvement.
Impacts of climate change are accelerating, and risks of physical and economic harm from natural disasters
are increasing. Moreover, these impacts and risks are concentrated in poorer countries  those least able to
handle the threats. Overall, results are mixed.
The worldwide rate of deforestation is still high but has slowed. Large-scale eorts to plant trees in
China, India, and Viet Nam have resulted in combined annual increases of about 4 million hectares of forests
since 2000. Unfortunately, that is about the same rate of forest loss in South America and Africa each.
Globally, the net loss of forest from 2000 to 2010 was 5.2 million hectares per year, down by a third from
the 1990s.
The world will likely meet the target of halving the proportion of people without access to clean water,
with the majority of progress made in rural areas. By 2008 most regions exceeded or nearly met the target
levels. The exceptions were Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa, which had only 50% and 60% respectively
of their populations with access to improved water sources. Those regions will almost certainly miss the
target. They, and most other developing regions, will also miss the target of halving the proportion of the
population lacking improved sanitation facilities. In fact, the total number of people without such access is
expected to grow until at least 2015.
From 1990 to 2007, emissions of carbon dioxide rose in developed regions by 11%; in developing regions,
which have much higher rates of population growth, emissions increased by 110%. While most indicators

SUSTAINABILITY
have shown either progress or minimal additional harm, carbon dioxide emissions stand out as one of the
signicant failures in achieving global sustainability.
Eorts to preserve biodiversity have made only minimal progress. One target was to have 10% of each of
the world's terrestrial ecosystem types protected by 2010; only half were. The proportion of key biodiversity
areas protected stagnated in the 2000s, after showing faster improvements in the 1970s-1990s. As a result,
the number of birds and mammals expected to go extinct in the near future has increased.
The environmental sustainability target for urban housing was meant to signicantly improve the lives
of 100 million slum-dwellers by 2020. This target diered from most others not only by using a later date
of 2020, but by lacking a specied proportion of the population. Setting a target as an absolute value for
the entire globe obscures the progress in individual countries, so this criterion may be revisited. From 1990
to 2010, the proportion of slum-dwellers decreased from 46% to 33%. However, during the same time, the
number of people living in slums increased from 657 million to 828 million. Over 200 million slum-dwellers
achieved access to clean water and improved sanitation facilities, so the target was met. However, it is widely
acknowledged that the target was set too low.
Even as we continue to strive toward the MDGs 2015 target date, it is also necessary to think beyond
them. Changing demographics will drive shifts in the global economy and the use of resources. Increased
eects of climate change will result in greater volatility, while technological developments can open new
opportunities. In light of these changes, evaluation of the MDGs must assess their utility after 2015. Should
the general framework stay in place, should it be modied with new approaches, or should it be replaced
with something fundamentally dierent?
9.4 Sustainability and Business132
9.4.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand how businesses incorporate sustainability into their plans, the basis of sustainable product
chains, and factors that need to be considered in measuring and assessing sustainable performance
9.4.2 Introduction
Throughout this text the integrative nature of environmental, social, and economic sustainability has been
stressed. In this chapter, various ways of framing the sustainability paradigm and measuring progress toward
its achievement have been presented. This section focuses more directly on businesses, and how they attempt
to incorporate sustainability into their decisions and plans. The business sector, continually seeking ways to
create competitive advantages, has become acutely aware of the general value of adjusting various business
models to accommodate consumers' desires for sustainable products and services. Still, the broad denition of
sustainable development provided by the Brundtland report is a dicult one to make operational. The World
Business Council for Sustainable Development133 has adapted Brundtland to a view more understandable
to business interests, focusing on living within the interest of natural systems and being cautious about
drawing down the principal (i.e. degrading natural ecosystems), but there remain substantial dierences
on precisely how to measure progress toward the goals of the sustainability paradigm.
It is a common practice for businesses to refer to the triple bottom line, a reference to the value of
a business going beyond dollar protability to include social and environmental costs and benets as well.
Indeed, many of the tools and indices outlined in Module Life Cycle Assessment (Section 9.2) and Module
Sustainability Metrics and Rating Systems (Section 9.3.1) are widely used by businesses to measure
progress toward corporate goals. However, there is no agreed upon way of using these tools, and many
businesses have developed their own methods for assessing progress. This has, inevitably perhaps, led to

claims and counter-claims by various parties about the sustainability of their products or services. Such
claims usually nd their way into corporate brochures and advertising so that, often without substantive
backing or very subjective analysis, the impression of signicant corporate sustainability is created, practices
known generally as greenwashing. Greenwashing is a concern because these kinds of advertising messages
can mislead consumers about the the environmental practices of a company or the environmental benets of
a product or service (Greenpeace, 2011 (p. 474)). Nevertheless, businesses must ultimately generate prots
to remain viable, and increasingly they are being held to account for their impacts on all aspects of business
operations, however dicult it may be to assign value to decisions made under conditions of considerable
uncertainty. The intergenerational mandate of Brundtland and the nature of modern environmental problems
facing society ask that business plans extend far beyond the usual ve to ten year range.
9.4.3 Tools for Assessing Sustainability in Business
One useful organizational framework for envisioning dierent kinds of costs and benets that businesses
encounter is referred to as Total Cost Assessment (TCA). TCA assigns levels of uncertainty to the types of
costs associated with various aspects of business activities. Typically ve such types are recognized:
• Type I (Direct Costs)  Costs associated with direct operation of the manufacturing or service enterprise
that can be readily attributed to a specic activity. Labor, medical, materials, land, and energy are
examples of this type of cost.
• Type II (Indirect Costs)  Costs similar to Type I that are not easily assigned to a specic activity
and thus are born more generally by the company. These include various kinds of overhead costs,
outsourced services and subcontracts (e.g. component subassemblies, janitorial needs), and general
support activities such as central oces for purchasing, human resources, etc.
• Type III (Contingent Liability Costs)  These are costs associated with environmental cleanup, noncompliance nes, product or service liability, civil suits, and accidents.
• Type IV (Internal Intangible Costs/Benets)  These are costs and benets that accrue to a business
that are connected to a variety of intangibles such as worker morale, consumer loyalty, corporate image,
and branding of products and services.
• Type V (External Costs)  Put simply, Type V costs are those associated with environmental degradation. They are external in the sense that normal nancial accounting does not include them; the
damage is born in a general sense by society at large. Environmental protection requirements that
are enforceable by various laws (see section Government and Laws on the Environment), and mandated market or taxation mechanisms, are policy decisions meant to internalize these costs, forcing the
generator of the pollution to either pay for the damage or prevent damage in the rst place.
Taken as a whole, these cost/benet types include all three of the basic elements of the sustainability
paradigm. However Type IV and V costs are often dicult to assign a dollar value to; indeed even if this
can be done, projecting their value into the future is an uncertain science.
Life cycle assessment (LCA) can also be used to visualize and organize a sustainability model for businesses (See Module Life Cycle Assessment (Section 9.2) for more information). Recall that LCA grew
out of industry's needs to understand how product manufacturing systems behave, and to develop workable
models that could be used to control and optimize material and energy ows, ensure product quality, manage
environmental impacts, and minimize costs (these functions are collectively referred to as the supply chain).
An expanded use of LCA incorporates the complete product chain, examining consumer uses, benets
and costs, and the post-consumer disposition of the product. This has led to product conceptualization and
development, and in some cases regulatory reform, that incorporate business practices and plans built upon
the concept of eco-eciency, and extended product/producer responsibility (EPR). Eco-eciency
is an evolutionary business model in which more goods and services are created with less use of resources,
and fewer emissions of waste and pollution. Extended product/producer responsibility involves the creation
of nancial incentives, and legal disincentives, to encourage manufacturers to make more environmentally
friendly products that incorporate end-of-life costs into product design and business plans. For example one business model that is conducive to EPR is a lease-and-take-back model in which products must

SUSTAINABILITY
eventually come back to the manufacturer or retailer, who then must reckon with the best way to minimize
end-of-life costs. Remanufacturing, recycling, and reuse of materials are the intended results of EPR, but
ordinary disposal, including landlling or incineration, can also be an option.
Figure LCA Framework Applied to Product Development (Figure 9.24), illustrates in a general
way how the LCA framework can be structured for understanding how product development can benet
from the various material and information transfers and feedback loops along the product chain. Such a
gure illustrates the complexities involved in creating, marketing, and discerning the impacts of a product or
service, and raises the general concept of what is often referred to as product stewardship, an approach in
which products are conceived, designed, manufactured, and marketed within a systems thinking context.
It is a way of framing environmental problems that recognizes the three parts of the sustainability paradigm,
and incorporates the concepts of sustainable manufacturing, marketing, utility-to-society, impacts of the use
of the product, and end-of-life disposition of the product.

9.4.4 Creating Uniformity
The problem of lack of uniformity in measuring, assessing, and valuing business actions taken at least in
part for the sake of sustainability might be dealt with more eectively through the development of uniform
standards and metrics that are applied by an agreed upon authority who uses transparent methodologies and
reporting techniques so that other companies, and consumers, can make more objective judgments about
comparative performances. From what has been presented in this section this may appear to be a nearimpossible task. Yet attempts in this direction are being made, for example by the aforementioned World
Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development135 , and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals136 . One of the more popular approaches

for measuring and ranking corporate sustainability has been developed by the Dow Jones Corporation (DJC),
through its Sustainability Index137 (DJSI). It may seem ironic that such a bastion of the free market economy has put together a system for measuring and assessing corporate sustainability, yet the size and general
acceptability of DJC by corporations and investors work in favor of the establishment of an objective and
transparent index. The DJSI itself was created in 1999 in response to the need, articulated from many sectors including consumers, for a way to assess progress toward sustainable corporate responsibility. The index
contains three general evaluative sectors  economic, social, and environmental  that reect the Brundtland
denition. Each sector is composed, in turn, of specic categories as follows:
Economic
• Codes of Conduct/Compliance/Corruption and Bribery
• Corporate Governance
• Risk and Crisis Management
• Industry-specic Criteria
Social
• Corporate Citizenship and Philanthropy
• Labor Practice Indicators
• Human Capital Development
• Social Reporting
• Talent Attraction and Retention
• Industry-specic Criteria
Environmental
• Environmental Performance (Eco-eciency)
• Environmental Reporting
• Industry-specic Criteria
Each of these categories is composed of quantitative measures and assigned a specic, and constant, weighting. From the data gathered, a best-in-class (i.e. industry class) ranking is published annually. The
index has engendered considerable corporate competition such that mere attainment of the previous year's
statistics, for a given company, usually results in a drop in rank. Of course one can argue with the choice
of categories, or the data that are gathered and the way categories are parameterized, or with the weighting
scheme used, but the important aspects of DJSI (and other sustainability rankings) is its comprehensiveness,
uniformity, and transparency.
9.4.5 Summary
In the nal analysis, no economy can move in the direction of sustainability without the active participation of
the business sector. In other words, signicant progress cannot be achieved through government or individual
actions alone. As noted above, this creates diculties and conicts for businesses. As they continue to work
together in the future, businesses and sustainability experts face many questions such as: What are the
best measures of sustainability and how should businesses develop and plan for delivering more sustainable
products and services? Is reliance on eco-eciency enough to reduce the impacts of increasing consumption?
Should businesses play a more signicant role in educating consumers on the factors that aect sustainable
development? How can businesses adapt to uncertainties that lie beyond the near term? What is the role of
government in overseeing or regulating business activities that contribute to sustainability?

Once we begin talking about sustainability, it's hard to stop. That's because sustainability is truly the
science of everything, from technical strategies for repowering our homes and cars, to the ecological study
of biodiversity in forests and oceans, to how we think and act as human beings. This latter categorythe
human dimensions of sustainabilityis the focus of this chapter. Much sustainability discourse focuses on
scientic, technical and regulatory issues, but there is increasing awareness that without changes in people's
attitudes and patterns of behavior, and how these attitudes are reected in public policymaking priorities,
meaningful reform toward a more sustainable management of natural resources will be impossible. One
key to this problem is that we are accustomed to thinking of the environment as a remote issue. Even the
words environment and nature themselves suggest the habitual view we take of ourselves as somehow
independent of or superior to the planet's material resources and processes. The truth is dierent. Humanity
is but a thread of nature's web, albeit an original and brilliant thread. So brilliant indeed that we are now
shaping the evolution of the web itself, to our short-term advantage, but in ways that cannot be sustained.
One example of the centrality of the human dimensions component of sustainability studies is the fact
that sustainable technologies of food and energy production are increasingly available, but have yet to be
adapted on the necessary scale to make a dierence to humanity's overall environmental footprint on the
planet. Many look to technology for answers to our myriad environmental problems, but the fact that
even the limited technological innovations that exist lack support and have been inadequately deployed is
a complex human issue, touching an essential resistance to change in our economic and political structures,
our lifestyles and culture and, at the micro-level, basic human psychology and behavior. This chapter will
explore these human dimensions of the sustainability challenge, with an emphasis on the historical and
cultural factors that have placed us on our dangerously unsustainable path, and which make changing course
so challenging.
Sustainability in human terms is, rst and foremost, a commonsense goal: to ensure that conditions on
earth continue to support the project of human civilization, that widely diverse populations of the global
community not slip into protracted crisis on account of deteriorating environmental conditions and depleted
resources. This preventive dimension of sustainability discourse inevitably involves doom projections. Despite the popularity of apocalyptic, end-of-the-world scenarios in Hollywood movies, science ction, and
some corners of the blogosphere, the biological end of the human race remains scarcely imaginablewe will
continue on, in some form. But in the emerging perfect storm of food stock declines, water scarcity, climate
disruption, and energy shortfalls, there now exist measurable global-scale threats to social order and basic
living standards that are the material bedrock of civic society as we recognize it.
The dramatic environmental changes underway on earth are already impacting human social systems.
Droughts, oods, and rising sea levels are taking lives, damaging infrastructure, reducing crop yields and
creating a new global underclass of environmental refugees. The question is how much more serious will these
impacts become and how soon? There are no reassuring answers if we continue on a business-as-usual path.
One thing about sustainability in the twenty-rst century is certain: individual nations and the international
community together will need to both mitigate the projected declines of the planet's ecosystems, and at
the same time adapt to those that are irreversible. As one popular sustainability policy mantra has it: we
must strive to avoid the unmanageable, while managing the unavoidable.
The environmental historian Sing Chew sees in the cluster of environmental crises of the early 21st
century the hallmarks of a potential new Dark Age, that is, a period of conict, resource scarcity and
cultural impoverishment such as has aicted the global human community only a few times over the past
ve millennia. The goal of sustainability, in these terms, is clear and non-controversial: to avoid a new and
scaled-up Dark Age in which the aspirations of billions of people, both living and yet unborn, face brutal
constraints. The implications of sustainability, in this sense, extend well beyond what might ordinarily
considered green issues, such as preserving rainforests or saving whales. Sustainability is a human and
social issue as much as it is environmental. Sustainability is about people, the habitats we depend on for
services vital to us, and our ability to maintain culturally rich civic societies free from perennial crises in
food, water, and energy supplies.

10.2 It's Not Easy Being Green: Anti-Environmental Discourse, Behavior, and Ideology3
10.2.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the complex connections that tie our modern lifestyles and the consumption of goods to
human and environmental impacts across the world
• relate our habits of consumption to the long history of human social development on evolutionary time
scales
• apply the working distinction between society and culture outlined in this section to explain the
dierent and often conictual attitudes toward the environment that exist today
10.2.2 Introduction
The consensus view among scientists and professional elites in the early twenty-rst century, as it has been
among environmental activists for a much longer time, is that our globalized industrial world system is on an
unsustainable path. Inherent in this view is a stern judgment of the recent past: we have not adapted well,
as a species, to the fruits of our own brilliant technological accomplishments, in particular, to the harnessing
of fossil fuels to power transport and industry.
Taking the long view of human evolution, it is not surprising to nd that we are imperfectly adapted to
our modern industrialized world of cars, computers, and teeming cities, or that human societies organized
for so many millennia around the problem of scarcity should treat a sudden abundance of resources with
the glee of a kid in a candy store. In evolutionary terms, we have simply not had sucient time to adapt
to the windfall of change. Though rapid advances in the biophysical sciences in recent decades mean that
we mostly understandour maladaptation to industrialization and the great dangers it poses, our political
decision-making and consumption patterns have barely changed on the basis of this understanding. This
sobering fact tells us that, at this moment in human history, social behavior and political decision-making
are not being driven by knowledge, but rather by entrenched attitudes that perpetuate an unsustainable
drawdown of earth's resources. In short, human decision making and consumption of material goods in our
fossil-fuel age continues to largely take place outside of an awareness of the strained and nite nature of our
planet's ecosystem services.
It is the character of modern consumer society to promote the idea that nothing is connected, that the
jeans we wear, or the food we eat, are matters of personal choice without any greater context beyond a
concern for immediate pleasure and peer approval. Sustainability, by contrast, teaches that everything is
connected. That favorite pair of jeans, for instance, is dependent on cheap labor in developing countries,
on heavily fertilized cotton plantations, and enormous volumes of water expended throughout the jeans'
lifecycle, from the irrigation to grow the cotton to the washing machine that cleans them. Or let's take that
cheap fast food lunch from yesterday: it most likely contained processed soybeans from a recently cleared
stretch of the Amazon rainforest, and articial sweeteners made from corn whose enormous production
quotas are subsidized by government tax revenues. The corn-based sweetener, in turn, turns out to be a
principal cause of the national obesity epidemic, a key contributor to spiraling health care costs. Thus the
value meal turns out not to be so economical after all, once the systems-wide eects are factored in.

10.2.3 Connectivity
To think about sustainability in these terms may sound exhausting. But because we live in a world characterized by connectivity, that is, bycomplex chains linking our everyday lives to distant strangers and
ecosystems in far ung regions of the earth, we have no choice. In the end, we must adapt our thinking to a
complex, connected model of the world and our place in it. Persisting with only simple, consumerist frames
of understandingI look great! This tastes delicious!for a complex world of remote impacts and nite
resources renders us increasingly vulnerable to episodes of what ecologists call system collapse, that is, to
the sudden breakdown of ecosystem services we rely upon for our life's staple provisions.
In the early twenty-rst century, vulnerability to these system collapses varies greatly according to where
one lives. A long-term drought in India might bring the reality of aquifer depletion or climate change home
to tens of thousands of people driven from their land, while the life of a suburban American teenager is
not obviously aected by any resource crisis. But this gap will narrow in the coming years. Overwhelming
scientic evidence points to rapidly increasing strains this century on our systems of food, water, and energy
provision as well as on the seasonable weather to which we have adapted our agricultural and urban regions.
In time, no one will enjoy the luxury of remaining oblivious to the challenges of sustainability. Drought, for
example, is one of the primary indices of global ecosystem stress, and arguably the most important to humans.
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, without wholesale reformation of water
management practices on a global scale, two-thirds of the world's population will face water shortages by
2025, including densely populated regions of the United States.
So how did we arrive at this point? Without you or I ever consciously choosing to live unsustainably,
how has it nevertheless come about that we face environmental crises of global scale, circumstances that will
so decisively shape our lives and those of our children? Here's one explanatory narrative, framed by the long
view of human evolution.
Since the emergence of the rst proto-human communities in Africa millions of years ago, we have spent
over 99% of evolutionary time as nomadic hunters and gatherers. A fraction of the balance of our time
on earth spans the 10,000 years of human agriculture, since the end of the last Ice Age. In turn, only a
third of that fractional period has witnessed the emergence of the institutions and technologieswriting,
money, mathematics, etc.that we associate with human civilization. And lastly, at the very tip of
the evolutionary timeline, no more than a blink of human species history, we nd the development of the
modern industrialized society we inhabit. Look around you. Observe for a moment all that is familiar in your
immediate surroundings: the streetscape and buildings visible through the window, the plastic furnishings
in the room, and the blinking gadgets within arm's length of where you sit. All of it is profoundly new
to human beings; to all but a handful of the tens of thousands of generations of human beings that have
preceded us, this everyday scene would appear baing and frightening, as if from another planet.
10.2.4 Normalization
In this sense, the real miracle of human evolution is that cars, computers, and cities appear so normal to
us, even sometimes boring and monotonous! Our perception of the extraordinary, rapid changes in human
societies in the past two centurieseven the past half-centuryis deadened by virtue of what is our greatest
evolutionary acquirement, namely normalization, an adaptive survival strategy fundamental to human
success over the millennia. The ability to accept, analyze, and adapt to often uctuating circumstances is
our great strength as a species. But at this point in human history it is also a grave weakness, what, in the
language of Greek tragedy might be called a fatal aw.
To oer an analogy, for many centuries slavery appeared normal to most people across the worlduntil
the late eighteenth century, when a handful of humanitarian activists in Britain began the long and dicult
process of de-normalizing human bondage in the eyes of their compatriots. The task of sustainability ethics
is analogous, and no less dicult, in that it lays out the argument for wholesale and disruptive attitude
adjustment and behavior change in the general population. Given the long-term adaptation of the human
species to the imperatives of hunter-gathering, our decision-making priorities and consumption drives still

482 CHAPTER 10. SUSTAINABILITY: ETHICS, CULTURE, AND HISTORY
tend toward the simple necessities, based on the presumption of relative and seasonal scarcity, and with little
emotional or social reward for restraint in the face of plenty, for viewing our choices in global terms, or for
measuring their impacts on future generations.
A working distinction between the historical evolution of human society and human culture is useful to
understanding the social and psychological obstacles to achieving sustainability. As both individuals and
societies, we work hard to insulate ourselves from unpleasant surprises, shocks, and disorder. We crave
security, and our legal and economic institutions accordingly have evolved over the millennia to form a
buer against what Shakespeare's Hamlet called the thousand natural shocks that esh is heir to. For
instance, the law protects us from violent physical harm (ideally), while insurance policies safeguard us from
nancial ruin in the event of an unexpected calamity.
In one sense, this security priority has determined the basic evolution of human societies, particularly
the decisive transition 10,000 years ago from the variable and risky life of nomadic hunter communities to
sedentary farming based on an anticipated stability of seasonal yields. Of course, the shift to agriculture only
partially satised the human desire for security as farming communities remained vulnerable to changing
climatic conditions and territorial warfare. Global industrialization, however, while it has rendered vast
populations marginal and vulnerable, has oered its beneciaries the most secure insulation yet enjoyed by
humans against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. This success has been a double-edged sword,
however, not least because the industrialized cocoon of our modern consumer lifestyles relentlessly promotes
the notion that we have transcended our dependence on the earth's basic resources. As it stands, we look at
our highly complex, industrialized world, and adapt our expectations and desires to its rewards. It is never
our rst instinct to ask whether the system of rewards itself might be unsustainable and collapse at some
future time as a result of our eager participation.
10.2.5 Sustainability Obstacles and Support
In terms of the evolutionary argument I am outlining here, our ability to grasp the sustainability imperative
faces two serious obstacles. The rst is psychological, namely the inherited mental frameworks that reward us
for the normalization and simplication of complex realities. The second is social, namely our economic and
institutional arrangements designed to protect us from material wants, as well as from risk, shock, disorder
and violent change. Both these psychological and social features of our lives militate against an ecological,
systems-based worldview.
Luckily, our cultural institutions have evolved to oer a counterweight to the complacency and inertia
encouraged by the other simple, security-focused principles governing our lives. If society is founded upon
the principle of security, and promotes our complacent feeling of independence from the natural world, we
might think of culture as the conscience of society. What culture does, particularly in the arts and sciences,
is remind us of our frailty as human beings, our vulnerability to shocks and sudden changes, and our
connectedness to the earth's natural systems. In this sense, the arts and sciences, though we conventionally
view them as opposites, in fact perform the same social function: they remind us of what lies beyond the
dominant security paradigm of our societieswhich tends to a simplied and binary view of human being
and natureby bringing us closer to a complex, systemic understanding of how the natural world works
and our embeddedness within it. Whether by means of an essay on plant biology, or a stage play about
family breakdown (like Hamlet), the arts and sciences model complex worlds and the systemic interrelations
that shape our lives. They expose complexities and connectivities in our world, and emphasize the material
consequences of our actions to which we might otherwise remain oblivious. The close relation between the
arts and sciences in the Western world is evidenced by the fact that their concerns have largely mirrored
each other over time, from the ordered, hierarchical worldview in the classical and early modern periods, to
the post-modern focus on connectivity, chaos, and emergence.
Life in the pre-modern world, in the memorable words of the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, was
mostly nasty, brutish, and short. By contrast, social and economic evolution has bestowed the inhabitants of
the twenty-rst century industrialized world with a lifestyle uniquely (though of course not wholly) insulated
from physical hardship, infectious disease, and chronic violence. This insulation has come at a cost, however,
namely our disconnection from the basic support systems of life: food, water and energy. This is a very

483
recent development. At the beginning of the 20th century, for example, almost half of Americans grew up on
farms. Now, fewer than two percent do. We experience the staples of life only at their service endpoints: the
supermarket, the faucet, the gas station. In this context, the real-world sources of food, water, and energy
do not seem important, while supplies appear limitless. We are not prepared for the inevitable shortages of
the future.
On the positive side, it is possible to imagine that the citizens of the developed world might rapidly
reconnect to a systems view of natural resources. One product of our long species evolution as hunters
and agricultural land managers is an adaptive trait the ecologist E. O. Wilson has called biophilia, that
is, a love for the natural world that provides for us. In the few centuries of our fossil fuel modernity, this
biophilia has become increasingly aestheticized and commodiedas landscape art, or nature tourism
and consequently marginalized from core social and economic decision structures. In the emerging age of
environmental decline and resource scarcity, however, our inherited biophilia will play a key role in energizing
the reform of industrialized societies toward a sustainable, renewable resource and energy future.
10.2.6 Review Questions
Question 10.2.1
How has the human capacity for normalization both helped and hindered social development, and
what are its implications for sustainable reform of our industries, infrastructure, and way of life?

It is a measure of our powers of normalization that we in the developed world take the existence of cheap
energy, clean water, abundant food, and international travel so much for granted, when they are such
recent endowments for humanity, and even now are at the disposal of considerably less than half the global
population. It is a constant surprise to us that a situation so normal could be having such abnormal eects
on the biospheredegrading land, water, air, and the vital ecosystems hosting animals and sh. How did
we get here? How can we square such apparent plenty with warnings of collapse?

Raw gures at least sketch the proportions of global change over the last 500 years. In 1500, even after
several centuries of rapid population growth, the global population was no more than 500 million, or less
than half the population of India today. It is now fourteen times as large, almost 7 billion. Over the same
period, global economic output has increased 120 times, most of that growth occurring since 1820, and with
the greatest acceleration since 1950. This combination of rampant population and economic growth since
1500 has naturally had major impacts on the earth's natural resources and ecosystem health. According
to the United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, by the beginning of the 21st century, 15 of the
world's 24 ecosystems, from rainforests to aquifers to sheries, were rated in serious decline.
10.3.3 Economic Development
Fundamental to signicant changes in human history has been social reaction to resource scarcity. By 1500,
Europeans, the rst engineers of global growth, had signicantly cleared their forests, settled their most
productive agricultural lands, and negotiated their internal borders. And yet even with large-scale internal
development, Europe struggled to feed itself, let alone to match the wealth of the then dominant global

empires, namely China and the Mughal States that stretched from the Spice Islands of Southeast Asia to
the busy ports of the Eastern Mediterranean. As a consequence of resource scarcity, European states began
to sponsor explorations abroad, in quest initially for gold, silver, and other precious metals to ll up their
treasuries. Only over time did Europeans begin to perceive in the New World the opportunities for remote
agricultural production as a source of income. Full-scale colonial settlement was an even later idea.
The new frontiers of European economic development in the immediate pre-industrial period 1500-1800
included tropical regions for plantation crops, such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, rice, indigo, and opium, and
temperate zones for the cultivation and export of grains. The seagoing merchants of Portugal, France, Spain,
Britain and the Netherlands trawled the islands of the East Indies for pepper and timber; established ports
in India for commerce in silk, cotton and indigo; exchanged silver for Chinese tea and porcelain; traded
sugar, tobacco, furs and rice in the Americas; and sailed to West Africa for slaves and gold. The slave
trade and plantation economies of the Americas helped shift the center of global commerce from Asia to the
Atlantic, while the new oceangoing infrastructure also allowed for the development of sheries, particularly
the lucrative whale industry. All these commercial developments precipitated signicant changes in their
respective ecosystems across the globedeforestation and soil erosion in particularalbeit on a far smaller
scale compared with what was to come with the harnessing of fossil fuel energy after 1800.
The 19th century witnessed the most rapid global economic growth seen before or mostly since, built on
the twin tracks of continued agricultural expansion and the new vertical frontiers of fossil fuel and mineral
extraction that truly unleashed the transformative power of industrialization on the global community and
its diverse habitats. For the rst time since the human transition to agriculture more than 10,000 years
before, a state's wealth did not depend on agricultural yields from contiguous lands, but owed rather from
a variety of global sources, and derived from the industrialization of primary products, such as cotton textiles,
minerals and timber. During this period, a binary, inequitable structure of international relations began to
take shape, with a core of industrializing nations in the northern hemisphere increasingly exploiting the
natural resources of undeveloped periphery nations for the purposes of wealth creation.

10.3.4 The Great Acceleration
Despite the impact of the world wars and economic depression on global growth in the early 20th century, the
new technological infrastructure of the combustion engine and coal-powered electricity sponsored increased
productivity and the sanitization of growing urban centers. Infectious diseases, the scourge of humanity for
thousands of years, retreated, more than compensating for losses in war, and the world's population continued
to increase dramatically, doubling from 1 to 2 billion in 50 years, and with it the ecological footprint of our
single species.
Nothing, however, is to be compared with the multiplying environmental impacts of human activities
since 1950, a period dubbed by historians as The Great Acceleration. In the words of the United Nations
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, over the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly
and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history, largely to meet rapidly growing
demands for food, fresh water, timber, ber, and fuel. This has resulted in a substantial and largely
irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth. The post-WWII global economic order promoted liberal and
accelerated trade, capital investment, and technological innovation tethered to consumer markets, mostly free
of environmental impact considerations. The resultant economic growth, and the corresponding drawdown
of natural resources, are nonlinear in character, which is, exhibiting an unpredictable and exponential rate
of increase.
All systems, human and natural, are characterized by nonlinear change. We are habituated to viewing our
history as a legible story of progress, governed by simple cause-and-eect and enacted by moral agents, with
the natural world as a backdrop to scenes of human triumph and tragedy. But history, from a sustainability
viewpoint, is ecological rather than dramatic or moral; that is, human events exhibit the same patterns

of systems connectivity, complexity, and non-linear transformation that we observe in the organic world,
from the genetic makeup of viruses to continental weather systems. The history of the world since 1950
is one such example, when certain pre-existing conditionspetroleum-based energy systems, technological
infrastructure, advanced knowledge-based institutions and practices, and population increasesynergized to
create a period of incredible global growth and transformation that could not have been predicted at the
outset based upon those conditions alone. This unforeseen Great Acceleration has brought billions of human
beings into the world, and created wealth and prosperity for many. But nonlinear changes are for the bad
as well as the good, and the negative impacts of the human triumph of postwar growth have been felt
across the biosphere. I will briey detail the human causes of the following, itself only a selective list: soil
degradation, deforestation, wetlands drainage and damming, air pollution and climate change.
10.3.4.1 Soil Degradation
Since the transition to agriculture 10,000 years ago, human communities have struggled against the reality
that soil suers nutrient depletion through constant plowing and harvesting (mostly nitrogen loss). The
specter of a signicant die-o in human population owing to stagnant crop yields was averted in the 1970s by
the so-called Green Revolution, which, through the engineering of new crop varieties, large-scale irrigation
projects, and the massive application of petroleum-based fertilizers to supplement nitrogen, increased staple
crop production with such success that the numbers suering malnutrition actually declined worldwide in
the last two decades of the 20th century, from 1.9 to 1.4 billion, even as the world's population increased
at 100 times background rates, to 6 billion. The prospects for expanding those gains in the new century
are nevertheless threatened by the success of industrial agriculture itself. Soil depletion, declining water
resources, and the diminishing returns of fertilizer technologyall the products of a half-century of industrial
agriculturehave seen increases in crop yields level o. At the same time, growing populations in developing
countries have seen increasing clearance of fragile and marginal agricultural lands to house the rural poor.
It has been estimated that industrial fertilizers have increased the planet's human carrying capacity by
two billion people. Unfortunately, most of the chemical fertilizer applied to soils does not nourish the crop as
intended, but rather enters the hydrological system, polluting aquifers, streams, and ultimately the oceans
with an oversupply of nutrients, and ultimately draining the oxygen necessary to support aquatic life. As
for the impact of fertilizers on soil productivity, this diminishes over time, requiring the application of ever
greater quantities in order to maintain yields.
10.3.4.2 Deforestation
Arguably the biggest losers from 20th century economic growth were the forests of the world's tropical regions
and their non-human inhabitants. Across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, approximately one-third of forest
cover has been lost. Because about half of the world's species inhabits tropical rainforests, these clearances
have had a devastating impact on biodiversity, with extinction rates now greater than they have been
since the end of the dinosaur era, 65 million years ago. Much of the cleared land was converted to agriculture,
so that the amount of irrigated soils increased vefold over the century, from 50 to 250m hectares. Fully
40% of the terrestrial earth's total organic output is currently committed to human use. But we are now
reaching the ceiling of productive land expansion, in terms of sheer area, while the continued productivity
of arable land is threatened by salinity, acidity and toxic metal levels that have now degraded soils across
one third of the earth's surface, some of them irreversibly.

is now rapidly diminishing, with devastating consequences for local ecosystems, water resources, and
global climate. Source: NASA9
10.3.4.3 Wetlands Drainage and Damming
Meanwhile, the worlds' vital wetlands, until recently viewed as useless swamps, have been ruthlessly
drained15% worldwide, but over half in Europe and North America. The draining of wetlands has gone
hand in hand with large-scale hydro-engineering projects that proliferated through the last century, such
that now some two-thirds of the world's fresh water passes through dam systems, while rivers have been
blocked, channeled, and re-routed to provide energy, irrigation for farming, and water for urban development. The long-term impacts of these projects were rarely considered in the planning stages, and collectively
they constitute a wholesale re-engineering of the planet's hydrological system in ways that will be dicult
to adapt to the population growth demands and changing climatic conditions of the 21st century. As for
the world's oceans, these increasingly show signs of acidication due to carbon emissions, threatening the
aquatic food chain and sh stocks for human consumption, while on the surface, the oceans now serve as a
global conveyor belt for colossal amounts of non-degradable plastic debris.

drain into the Gulf of Mexico, creating an ever-growing dead zone. Source: Environmental Protection
Agency10
10.3.4.4 Air Pollution
In many parts of the world, pollution of the air by industrial particles is now less a problem than it was
a century ago, when newspapers lamented the black snow over Chicago. This is due to concerted eorts
by a clean air caucus of international scope that arose in the 1940s and gained signicant political inuence
with the emergence of the environmental movement in the 1970s. The impact of the post-70s environmental
movement on the quality of air and water, mostly in the West, but also developing countries such as India, is
the most hopeful precedent we have that the sustainability issues facing the world in the new century might
yet be overcome, given political will and organization equal to the task.
10.3.4.5 Climate Change
Air pollution is still a major problem in the megacities of the developing world, however, while a global
change in air chemistryan increase of 40% in the carbon load of the atmosphere since industrialization
is ushering in an era of accelerated climate change. This era will be characterized by increased droughts
and oods, higher sea levels, and extreme weather events, unevenly and unpredictably distributed across
the globe, with the highest initial impact in regions that, in economic and infrastructural terms, can least
support climate disruption (for example, sub-Saharan Africa). The environmental historian J. R. McNeil
estimates that between 25 and 40 million people died from air pollution in the 20th century. The death toll
arising from climate change in the 21st century is dicult to predict, but given the scale of the disruption
to weather systems on which especially marginal states depend, it is likely to be on a much larger scale.

10.3.5 Summary
From the Portuguese sea merchants of the 16th century in quest of silver and spices from Asia, to the
multinational oil companies of today seeking to drill in ever more remote and fragile undersea regions, the
dominant view driving global economic growth over the last half millennium has been instrumentalist, that
is, of the world's ecosystems as alternately a source of raw materials (foods, energy, minerals) and a dump
for the wastes produced by the industrialization and consumption of those materials. The instrumentalist
economic belief system of the modern era, and particularly the Industrial Age, is based on models of perennial
growth, and measures the value of ecosystems according to their production of resources maximized for
eciency and hence prot. In this prevailing system, the cost of resource extraction to the ecosystem itself
is traditionally not factored into the product and shareholder values of the industry. These costs are, in
economic terms, externalized.
A future economics of sustainability, by contrast, would prioritize the management of ecosystems for
resilience rather than pure capital eciency, and would incorporate the cost of ecosystem management into
the pricing of goods. In the view of many sustainability theorists, dismantling the system of unnatural
subsidization of consumer goods that has developed over the last century in particular is the key to a
sustainable future. Only a reformed economic system of natural pricing, whereby environmental costs are
reected in the price of products in the global supermarket, will alter consumer behavior at the scale necessary
to ensure economic and environmental objectives are in stable alignment, rather than in constant conict.
As always in the sustainability paradigm, there are tradeos. A future economy built on the principle of
resilience would be very dierent from that prevalent in the economic world system of the last 500 years in
that its managers would accept reduced productivity and eciency in exchange for the long-term vitality of
the resource systems on which it depends.

10.4.2 Introduction
Transition to a sustainable resource economy is a dauntingly large and complex project, and will increasingly
drive research and policy agendas across academia, government, and industry through the twenty-rst century. To theorize sustainability, in an academic setting, is not to diminish or marginalize it. On the contrary,
the stakes for sustainability education could not be higher. The relative success or failure of sustainability
education in the coming decades, and its inuence on government and industry practices worldwide, will be
felt in the daily lives of billions of people both living and not yet born.
The core of sustainability studies, in the academic sense, is systems literacya simple denition,
but with complex implications. Multiple indicators tell us that the global resource boom is now reaching
a breaking point. The simple ethos of economic growthmore is betteris not sustainable in a world
of complex food, water and energy systems suering decline. The grand challenge of sustainability is to
integrate our decision-making and consumption patternsalong with the need for economic viability
within a sustainable worldview. This will not happen by dumb luck. It will require, rst and foremost,
proper education. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, universal literacyreading and writingwas
the catch-cry of education reformers. In the twenty-rst century, a new global literacy campaign is needed,
this time systems literacy, to promote a basic understanding of the complex interdependency of human and
natural systems.
Here I will lay out the historical basis for this denition of sustainability in terms of systems literacy, and
oer specic examples of how to approach issues of sustainability from a systems-based viewpoint. Systems
literacy, as a fundamental goal of higher education, represents the natural evolution of interdisciplinarity,
which encourages students to explore connections between traditionally isolated disciplines and has been a
reformist educational priority for several decades in the United States. Systems literacy is an evolved form
of cross-disciplinary practice, calling for intellectual competence (not necessarily command) in a variety of
elds in order to better address specic real-world environmental problems.
For instance, a student's research into deforestation of the Amazon under a sustainability studies
paradigm would require investigation in a variety of elds not normally brought together under the traditional disciplinary regime. These elds might include plant biology, hydrology, and climatology, alongside
economics, sociology, and the history and literature of post-colonial Brazil. Systems literacy, in a nutshell,
combines the study of social history and cultural discourses with a technical understanding of ecosystem
processes. Only this combination oers a comprehensive view of real-world environmental challenges as they
are unfolding in the twenty-rst century.
From the viewpoint of systems literacy sustainability studies works on two planes at once. Students of
sustainability both acknowledge the absolute interdependence of human and natural systemsindeed that
human beings and all their works are nothing if not naturalwhile at the same time recognizing that to solve
our environmental problems we must often speak of the natural world and human societies as if they were
separate entities governed by dierent rules. For instance, it is very useful to examine aspects of our human
system as diachronicas progressively evolving over historical timewhile viewing natural systems more
according to synchronic patterns of repetition and equilibrium. The diachronic features of human social
evolution since 1500 would include the history of trade and nance, colonization and frontier development,
and technology and urbanization, while examples of nature's synchronicity would be exemplied in the
migratory patterns of birds, plant and animal reproduction, or the microbial ecology of a lake or river.
A diachronic view looks at the changes in a system over time, while the synchronic view examines the
interrelated parts of the system at any given moment, assuming a stable state.
While the distinction between diachronic and synchronic systems is in some sense articial, it does
highlight the structural inevitability of dysfunction when the two interlocked systems operate on dierent
timelines and principles. The early twentieth century appetite for rubber to service the emerging automobile industry, for instance, marks an important chapter in the heroic history of human technology, while
signifying a very dierent transition in the history of forest ecosystems in Asia and Latin America. Human
history since the agricultural transition 10,000 years ago, and on a much more dramatic scale in the last two
hundred years, is full of such examples of new human technologies creating sudden, overwhelming demand for
a natural resource previously ignored, and reshaping entire ecosystems over large areas in order to extract,

transport and industrialize the newly commodied material.
10.4.3 Biocomplexity
For students in the humanities and social sciences, sustainability studies requires adoption of a new conceptual
vocabulary drawn from the ecological sciences. Among the most important of these concepts is complexity.
Biocomplexitythe chaotically variable interaction of organic elements on multiple scalesis the dening
characteristic of all ecosystems, inclusive of humans. Biocomplexity science seeks to understand this nonlinear
functioning of elements across multiple scales of time and space, from the molecular to the intercontinental,
from the microsecond to millennia and deep time. Such an approach hasn't been possible until very recently.
For example, only since the development of (aordable) genomic sequencing in the last decade have biologists
begun to investigate how environments regulate gene functions, and how changes in biophysical conditions
place pressure on species selection and drive evolution.
Figure 10.8: The Biocomplexity Spiral The biocomplexity spiral illustrates the concept of biocomplexity, the chaotically variable interaction of organic elements on multiple scales. Source: U.S. National
Science Foundation12
How is the concept of complexity important to sustainability studies? To oer one example, a biocomplexity paradigm oers the opportunity to better understand and defend biodiversity, a core environmental

493
concern. Even with the rapid increase in knowledge in the biophysical sciences in recent decades, vast gaps
exist in our understanding of natural processes and human impacts upon them. Surprisingly little is known,
for example, about the susceptibilities of species populations to environmental change or, conversely, how
preserving biodiversity might enhance the resilience of an ecosystem. In contrast to the largely reductionist
practices of twentieth-century science, which have obscured these interrelationships, the new biocomplexity science begins with presumptions of ignorance, and from there goes on to map complexity, measure
environmental impacts, quantify risk and resilience, and oer quantitative arguments for the importance
of biodiversity. Such arguments, as a scientic supplement to more conventional, emotive appeals for the
protection of wildlife, might then form the basis for progressive sustainability policy.
But such data-gathering projects are also breathtaking in the demands they place on analysis. The
information accumulated is constant and overwhelming in volume, and the methods by which to process
and operationalize the data toward sustainable practices have either not yet been devised or are imperfectly
integrated within academic research structures and the policy-making engines of government and industry.
To elaborate those methods requires a humanistic as well as scientic vision, a need to understand complex
interactions from the molecular to the institutional and societal level.
A practical example of biocomplexity as the frame for studies in environmental sustainability are the
subtle linkages between the hypoxic dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico and farming practices in the Mississippi
River watershed. To understand the impact of hydro-engineered irrigation, nitrogen fertilizer, drainage, and
deforestation in the Midwest on the sheries of the Gulf is a classic biocomplexity problem, requiring data
merging between a host of scientic specialists, from hydrologists to chemists, botanists, geologists, zoologists
and engineers. Even at the conclusion of such a study, however, the human dimension remains to be explored,
specically, how industry, policy, culture and the law have interacted, on decadal time-scales, to degrade the
tightly coupled riverine-ocean system of the Mississippi Gulf. A quantitative approach only goes so far. At
a key moment in the process, fact accumulation must give way to the work of narrative, to the humanistic
description of desires, histories, and discourses as they have governed, in this instance, land and water use
in the Mississippi Gulf region.
To complexity should be added the terms resilience and vulnerability, as core concepts of sustainability
studies. The resilience of a systemlet's take for example, the wildlife of the Arctic Circlerefers to the
self-renewing stability of that system, its ability to rebound from shocks and threats within the range of
natural variability. The vulnerability of Artic wildlife, conversely, refers to the point at which resilience
is eroded to breaking point. Warming temperatures in the Arctic, many times the global average, now
threaten the habitats of polar bear and walruses, and are altering the breeding and migratory habits of
almost all northern wildlife populations. The human communities of the Arctic are likewise experiencing the
threshold of their resilience through rising sea levels and coastal erosion. Entire villages face evacuation and
the traumatic prospect of life as environmental refugees.
As mentioned earlier, we have grown accustomed to speaking of nature or the environment as if they
were somehow separate from us, something that might dictate our choice of holiday destination or wall
calendar, but nothing else. A useful counter-metaphor for sustainability studies, to oset this habitual view,
is to think of human and natural systems in metabolic terms. Like the human body, a modern city, for
example, is an energy-dependent system involving inputs and outputs. Every day, millions of tons of natural
resources (raw materials, consumer goods, food, water, energy) are pumped into the world's cities, which
turn them out in the form of waste (landll, euent, carbon emissions, etc.).
Unlike the human body, however, the metabolism of modern cities is not a closed and self-sustaining
system. Cities are consuming resources at a rate that would require a planet one and a half times the size
of Earth to sustain, and are ejecting wastes into the land, water, and air that are further degrading the
planet's ability to renew its vital reserves. Here, another body metaphorthe environmental footprint
has become a popular means for imagining suciency and excess in our consumption of resources. The
footprint metaphor is useful because it provides us an image measurement of both our own consumption
volume and the environmental impact of the goods and services we use. By making sure to consume less,
and to utilize only those goods and services with a responsibly low footprint, we in turn reduce our own
footprint on the planet. In important ways, the problem of unsustainability is a problem of waste. From a

purely instrumentalist or consumerist viewpoint, waste is incidental or irrelevant to the value of a product. A
metabolic view of systems, by contrast, promotes sustainability concepts such as closed loops and carbon
neutrality for the things we manufacture and consume, whereby there are no toxic remainders through the
entire lifecycle of a product. In this sense, systems literacy is as much a habit or style of observing the
everyday world as it is an academic principle for the classroom. Because in the end, the fate of the world's
ecosystems will depend not on what we learn in the classroom but on the extent to which we integrate
that learning in our lives beyond it: in our professional practice and careers, and the lifestyle and consumer
choices we make over the coming years and decades. If systems literacy translates into a worldview and way
of life, then sustainability is possible.
10.4.4 Review Questions
Question 10.4.1
What are synchronicand diachronic views of time, and how does the distinction help us to understand the relation between human and natural systems, and to potentially rewrite history from an
environmental point of view?
Question 10.4.2
How is a bio-complex view of the relations between human and natural systems central to sustainability, in both theory and practice?
10.5 The Vulnerability of Industrialized Resource Systems: Two Case
Studies13
10.5.1 Introduction
Sustainability is best viewed through specic examples, or case studies. One way of conceiving sustainability
is to think of it as a map that shows us connections between apparently unrelated domains or sequences of
events. To cite an earlier example, what do the cornelds of Illinois have to do with the decline of sheries in
the Gulf of Mexico? To the uneducated eye, there is no relationship between two areas so remote from each
other, but a sustainable systems analysis will show the ecological chain linking the use of chemical fertilizers
in the Midwest, with toxic runo into the Mississippi Basin, with changes in the chemical composition in
the Gulf of Mexico (specically oxygen depletion), to reduced sh populations, and nally to economic
and social stress on Gulf shing communities. Here, I will look at two case studies in greater detail, as a
model for the systems analysis approach to sustainability studies in the humanities. The rst concerns the
alarming worldwide decline of bee populations (Section 10.6) since 2006, owing to a new aiction named
Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). The second case study examines the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico
(Section 10.7) in 2010, considered in the larger historical context of global oil dependency.
10.5.2 Our Faustian Bargain
Before the emergence of coal and later oil as highly ecient and adaptable energy sources, human beings
relied on mostly renewable sources of energy, principally their own muscle power, supplemented to varying
degrees by the labor of domesticated farm animals, wood and peat for fuel, and the harnessing of wind and
water for milling and sailing. An extraordinary and rapid transformation occurred with the extraction of
latent solar power from ancient organic deposits in the earth. On the eve of industrialization, around 1800,
the raw muscle power of human beings was responsible for probably 70% of human energy expenditure,
while slaverya brutal system for the concentration of that energyfunctioned as a cornerstone of global
economic growth. In the 1500-1800 period, in addition to the ten million or more Africans transported to

slave colonies in the Americas, several times as many Indian and Chinese laborers, under various regimes of
servitude, migrated across the globe to answer labor shortages within the globalizing Atlantic economy.
But technical improvements in the steam engine revolutionized this longstanding energy equation. Already by 1800, a single engine could produce power the equivalent of two hundred men. Today, a single
worker, embedded within a technologized, carbon-driven industry, takes a week to produce what an 18th
century laborer would take four years to do, while the average middle-class household in the industrialized
world consumes goods and energy at a rate equivalent to having 100 slaves at their disposal round-the-clock.
In the famous medieval story of Faust, a scholar who dabbles in black magic sells his soul in exchange
for extraordinary powers to satisfy his every desire. The Faust story provides an excellent analogy for our
200-year love aair with cheap fossil fuel energy. Our planetary carbon endowment has provided us with
extraordinary powers to bend space and time to the shape of our desires and convenience, and ll it with cool
stu. But petroleum and coal are nite resources, and such is the environmental impact of our carbon-based
Faustian lifestyle that scientists have now awarded our industrial period, a mere blink in geological time, its
own title in the 4 billion year history of the planet: the Anthropocene. We are no longer simply biological
creatures, one species among thousands, but biophysical agents, reshaping the ecology of the entire planet,
and shaping the fates of all species.

Figure 10.9: Faust and Mephistopheles Mephistopheles, the devil gure in Goethe's play Faust,

the earth, with no limits to his powers. Source: Public Domain. Illustration by Alphonse de Neuville14
In short, we are all Fausts now, not the insignicant, powerless creatures we sometime feel ourselves to
be, but rather, the lords of the planet. How this came to pass is an object lesson in complex diachronic
evolution. Without any single person deciding, or any law passed, or amendment made to the constitution,
we have transformed ourselves over but a few centuries from one struggling species among all the rest, to
being planetary managers, now apparently exempted from the evolutionary struggle for survival with other
species, with the fate of animals, birds, sh, plants, the atmosphere, and entire ecosystems in our hands.
This Faustian power signals both our strength and vulnerability. We are dependent on the very ecosystems
we dominate. That is, we have become carbon-dependent by choice, but we are ecosystem-dependent by
necessity. We may all be supermen and wonderwomen relative to the poor powers of our forebears, but we
still require food, clean water, and clean air. The billion or more people on earth currently not plugged
into the carbon energy grid, and hence living in dire poverty, need no reminding of this fact. Many of us
in the developed world do, however. Our civilization and lifestyles as human beings have changed beyond
recognition, but our biological needs are no dierent from our species ancestors on the East African savannah
a million years ago. In sum, the lesson of the Faust story is hubris. We are not exempt from natural laws,

as Faust recklessly hoped.
To understand the impact of our fossil fuel based, industrialized society on the planet we inhabit requires
we think on dual time scales. The rst is easy enough, namely, the human scale of days and years. For
example, consider the time it takes for liquid petroleum to be extracted from the earth, rened, transported
to a gas station, and purchased by you in order to drive to school or the shopping Mall. Or the time it takes
for that sweater you buy at the mall to be manufactured in China or Indonesia and transported thousands
of miles to the shelf you grab it from. This is an oil-dependent process from beginning to end: from the
petroleum-based fertilizers that maximized the productive eciency of the cotton plantation, to powering
the machinery in the factory, to the massive goods ship transporting your sweater across the oceans, to the
lights in the store that illuminate your sweater at the precise angle for it to catch your eye.
Now consider the second time scale, to which we are usually obliviousthe thousands or millions of years
it has taken for terrestrial carbon to form those reserves of liquid petroleum that brought you your sweater.
This is a process describable only on a geological time scale, the costs of the disruption to which have been
wholly omitted from the sticker price of the sweater. What are the environmental, and ultimately human
costs that have been externalized? In powering our modern societies through the transference of the earth's
carbon reserves from long-term storage and depositing it in the atmosphere and oceans, we have signicantly
altered and destabilized the earth's carbon cycle. There is now 40% more carbon in the atmosphere and
oceans than in 1800, at the outset of the industrial age. The earth's climate system is reacting accordingly,
to accommodate the increased nonterrestrial carbon load. The result is altered weather patterns, increasing
temperatures, glacial melt, and sharp increases in droughts, oods, and wildres. The cost to the global
economy of these climate disruptions this century has been projected in the trillions of dollars, even before we
consider the human costs of climate change in mortality, homelessness, impoverishment, and social instability.
Extracting carbon from the earth, and transforming it into energy, fertilizers, and products has enabled
an almost magical transformation of human lives on earth, as compared to those of our premodern ancestors.
The house you live in, the clothes you wear, the food you eat, the gadgets you use, and all the dreams you
dream for your future, are carbon-based dreams. These amazing fossil-fuel energy sourcesoil, coal, gas
have created modernity itself: a crest of population growth, economic development, prosperity, health and
longevity, pulling millions out of poverty, and promoting, life, liberty, and happiness. This modernity is
truly a thing of wonder, involving the high-speed mass transport of people, goods, and information across
the globe, day after day. Regardless of the season, it brings us apples from New Zealand, avocadoes from
Mexico, and tomatoes that have traveled an average of 2000 miles to reach the fresh produce section of our
supermarkets. Having bought our groceries for the week, we jump in our car and drive home. Because our
species ancestors were both nomads and settlers, we love our cars and homes with equal passion. We value
both mobility and rootedness. Done with roaming for the day, we cherish our indoor lives in atmospherically
controlled environments: cool when hot outside, toasty when cold, light when dark, with digital devices
plugged in and available 24/7. A miraculous lifestyle when one sits back to reect, and all the result of
ongoing carbon-intensive investments in human comfort and convenience.
But it is also a 200-year chemistry experiment, with our planet as the laboratory. We are carbon beings in
our own molecular biology; we touch and smell it; we trade, transport, and spill it; we consume and dispose
of it in the earth and air. Intensifying heat and storms and acidifying oceans are carbon's elemental answer
to the questions we have posed to the earth system's resilience. Mother Nature is having her say, acting
according to her nature, and prompting us now to act according to our own mostly forgotten naturesas
beings dependent on our ecosystem habitat of sun, rain, soil, plants, and animals, with no special allowance
beyond the sudden responsibility of reformed stewardship and management.
The 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (Section 10.7) was a spectacular warning that the 200-year
era of cheap fossil fuel energy is drawing to a close. With viable oil reserves likely to be exhausted in the
next decade or so, and the dangers to global climate associated with continued reliance on coal and natural
gas, the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon global economyby means that do not impoverish billions
of people in the processlooms as nothing less than the Great Cause of the 21st century, and without doubt
the greatest challenge humanity has faced in its long residence on earth. The stakes could not be higher for
this task, which is of unprecedented scope and complexity. If enormous human and nancial resources were

expended in meeting the greatest challenges faced by the international community in the 20th centurythe
defeat of fascism, and the hard-earned progress made against poverty and infectious diseasesthen the lowcarbon sustainability revolution of our century will require the same scale of resources and more. At present,
however, only a tiny fraction of those resources have been committed.
10.6 Case Study: Agriculture and the Global Bee Colony Collapse15
Two thousand years ago, at the height of the Roman Empire, the poet Virgil wrote lovingly about the practice
of beekeeping, of cultivating the aerial honey and ambrosial dews he called gifts of heaven (Georgics IV:
1-216 ). Bees represent a gift to humanity even greater that Virgil knew. In addition to satisfying the human
appetite for honey, the Italian honeybee, Apis melliora, is the world's most active pollinator, responsible
for over 80 of the world's most common nongrain crops, including apples, berries, almonds, macadamias,
pumpkins, melons, canola, avocadoes, and also coee beans, broccoli and lettuce. Even the production
chain of the enormous meat and cotton industries relies at crucial points on the ministrations of the humble
honeybee. We depend on pollinated fruits, nuts and seeds for a third of our caloric intake, and for vital
vitamins, minerals and antioxidants in our diet. In total, around 80% of the foods we eat are to some degree
the products of bee pollination, representing one third of total agricultural output.
Given the $1 trillion value of pollinated produce, any threat to the health of honey bees represents a
serious threat to the human food chaina classic sustainability issue. With the industrialization of the
global agricultural system over the last 50 yearsincluding crop monoculture and mass fertilizationbees
have indeed faced a series of threats to their ancient role, the most recent of which, so-called Colony Collapse
Disorder, is the most serious yet.

In his poetic primer on beekeeping, Virgil includes a moving description of a bee colony suering mysterious decline:
Observe the symptoms when they fall away
And languish with insensible decay.
They change their hue; with haggard eyes they stare . . .
The sick, for air, before the portal gasp,
Their feeble legs within each other clasp,
Or idle in their empty hives remain,

500 CHAPTER 10. SUSTAINABILITY: ETHICS, CULTURE, AND HISTORY
Benumbed with cold, and listless of their gain. (368-78)
Beekeepers worldwide faced an even worse predicament in late 2006: the mysterious disappearance of
entire hives of bees. Over the winter, honeybees enter a form of survival hibernation. Their populations
suer inevitable losses, but these are replenished by the Queen's renewed laying of eggs once winter thaws.
In the spring of 2007, however, hundreds of thousands of colonies in the United States did not survive the
winter. A full 30% of all honeybee colonies died. Each spring since has witnessed even worse declines.
Similar losses aicted Europe and Asia. Worldwide, millions of colonies and billions of bees have perished
since 2006 on account of the new bee plague.
Because the global commercial value of bee pollination is so enormous, well-funded research into colony
collapse began immediately. A number of theories, some credible, some not, were quickly advanced. Several
studies pointed to new or enhanced viral strains, while others suggested the toxic eect of industrial fertilization. Still others claimed that mobile phone towers were interfering with the bees' navigations systems.
Because the honeybee is a charismatic creature and features so prominently in our cultural lorewe admire
their industriousness, fear their stings, call our loved ones honey, and talk much of Queen Beesthe story
of colony collapse was quickly taken up by the media. A urry of news stories announced CCD as an epic
disaster and profound mystery, which was true in simple terms, but which cast bee decline as a new and
sudden calamity for which some single culprit must be responsible.
The truth, as it is now unfolding, is more complex, and shows the importance of viewing the interactions
between human and natural ecologies in systemic terms. In strictly pathogenic terms, CCD is caused by the
combination of a virus (called Iridoviridae or IIV) and a microsporidian fungus called Nosema. The specic
interaction between the pathogens, and why they cause bees in their millions to vacate their hives, is not
understood. What is becoming clear, however, is the increasing burden being placed on bees by the human
agricultural system, a burden that has rendered bees increasingly vulnerable to epidemic infection. Humans
have been keeping bees for eight thousand years, and European bees were at the vanguard of the successful
crop colonization of the Americas. But the numbers of bees in the United States had already declined by a
third since 1950 before the arrival of CCD, owing to various viral and mite infestations, and the large scale
changes in bee habitat and lifestyle.
Before the industrialization of farming, bees came from neighboring wildlands to pollinate the diverse
range of crops available to them on small plots. But the conversion, for economic reasons, of arable land into
enormous monocrop properties in the last sixty years, and hence the diminishment of proximate wildower
habitats, has necessitated a dierent system, whereby bees are trucked around the country to service one
crop at a time, be it peppers in Florida, blueberries in Maine, or almonds in California. At the height of
the recent almond boom, the California crop required almost the entire bee population of the United States
to be fully pollinated. Wholesale suburbanization is also to blame for the destruction of the bees' natural
wildower habitats. Be it a thousand acre corneld or a suburban street of well-tended green lawns, to a
bees' eyes, our modern landscape, engineered to human needs, is mostly a desert.
Studies that have not identied specic culprits for CCD have nevertheless shown the extent of the longterm decline in bee health wrought by their conscription to industrial agriculture. For instance, researchers
found no fewer than 170 dierent pesticides in samples of American honeybees, while other studies found
that even bees not suering CCD habitually carry multiple viral strains in their systems. The combined
toxic and viral load for the average honeybee is enormous. In the words of Florida's state apiarist, I'm
surprised honey bees are alive at all. (Jacobsen, 2008, p. 137 (p. 501)) A further study showed a decline in
the immune systems of bees owing to lack of diverse nutrition. Pollinating only almonds for weeks on end,
then travelling on a atbed truck for hundreds of miles in order to service another single crop, is not the
lifestyle bees have adapted to over the near 80 million years of their existence. As Virgil warned, First, for
thy bees a quiet station nd. The lives of modern bees have been anything but quiet, and the enormous
changes in their habitat and lifestyle have reduced their species' resilience.
The most important lesson of recent research into CCD is not the identication of IIV and Nosema
as the specic contributors, but the larger picture it has provided of a system under multiple long-term
stresses. Complex systems, such as bee pollination and colony maintenance, are not characterized by linear
development, but rather by sudden, nonlinear changes of state called tipping points. CCD is an example
Available for free at Connexions <http://cnx.org/content/col11325/1.45>
501
of a potential tipping point in a natural system on which humans depend, in which sudden deterioration
overtakes a population beyond its ability to rebound. Everything seems ne, until it isn't. One day we have
almonds, berries, melon, and coee on our breakfast menu. The next day there's a critical shortage, and we
can't aord them.
In sustainability terms, bee colony collapse is a classic human dimensions issue. CCD will not be solved
simply by the development of a new anti-viral drug or pesticide targeting the specic pathogens responsible.
Part of what has caused CCD is the immunosuppressive eects of generations of pesticides developed to
counter previous threats to bee populations, be they microbes or mites. Our chemical intervention in the
lifecycle of bees has, in evolutionary terms, selected for a more vulnerable bee. That is, bees' current lack
of resilience is a systemic problem in our historical relationship to bees, which dates back thousands of years,
but which has altered dramatically in the last fty years in ways that now threaten collapse. And this is to
say nothing of the impact of bee colony collapse on other pollination-dependent animals and birds, which
would indeed be catastrophic in biodiversity terms.
That we have adapted to bees, and they to us, is a deep cultural and historical truth, not simply a sudden
disaster requiring the scientic solution of a mystery. In the light of sustainability systems analysis, the
bee crisis appears entirely predictable and the problem clear cut. The diculty arises in crafting strategies
for how another complex system on a massive scale, namely global agriculture, can be reformed in order to
prevent its collapse as one ow-on eect of the global crisis of the vital honey bee. The incentive for such
reform could not be more powerful. The prospect of a future human diet without fruits, nuts and coee is
bleak enough for citizens of the developed world and potentially fatal for millions of others in the long term.

Question 10.6.1

10.7 Case Study: Energy and the BP Oil Disaster18
On the night of April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, one of hundreds operating in the Gulf of
Mexico, exploded, killing eleven men, and placing one of the most rich and diverse coastal regions on earth
in imminent danger of petroleum poisoning. BP had been drilling in waters a mile deep, and in the next two
days, as the rig slowly sank, it tore a gash in the pipe leading to the oil well on the ocean oor. Over the
next three months, two hundred million gallons of crude oil poured into the Gulf, before the technological
means could be found to seal the undersea well. It was the worst environmental disaster in American history,
and the largest peacetime oil spill ever.

The BP oil disaster caused untold short- and long-term damage to the region. The initial impact on the
Gulfthe oil washing up on beaches from Texas to Florida, and economic hardship caused by the closing
down of Gulf shingwas covered closely by the news media. The longer term impacts of the oil spill on
wetlands erosion, and sh and wildlife populations, however, will not likely receive as much attention.
Much public debate over the spill has focused on the specic causes of the spill itself, and in apportioning
responsibility. As with the example of bee colony collapse, however, the search for simple, denitive causes can
be frustrating, because the breakdown is essentially systemic. Advanced industries such as crop pollination
and oil extraction involve highly complex interactions among technological, governmental, economic, and
natural resource systems. With that complexity comes vulnerability. The more complex a system, the more
points at which its resiliency may be suddenly exposed. In the case of the Deepwater Horizon rig, multiple
technological safeguards simply did not work, while poor and sometimes corrupt government oversight of
the rig's operation also amplied the vulnerability of the overall systema case of governmental system
failure making technological failure in industry more likely, with an environmental disaster as the result.
In hindsight, looking at all the weaknesses in the Gulf oil drilling system, the BP spill appears inevitable.

But predicting the specic vulnerabilities within large, complex systems ahead of time can be next to
impossible because of the quantity of variables at work. Oil extraction takes place within a culture of prot
maximization and the normalization of risk, but in the end, the lesson of BP oil disaster is more than a
cautionary tale of corporate recklessness and lax government oversight. The very fact that BP was drilling
under such risky conditionsa mile underwater, in quest of oil another three miles under the ocean ooris
an expression of the global demand for oil, the world's most valuable energy resource. To understand that
demand, and the lengths to which the global energy industry will go to meet it, regardless of environmental
risk, requires the longer view of our modern history as a fossil-fueled species.

10.8 Sustainability Ethics20
10.8.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the principle of the intergenerational social contract at the core of sustainability ethics
• dene the global terms of responsibility for action on sustainability, both the remote responsibilities
applicable to you as an individual consumer, and the historically-based concept of shared but dierentiated responsibilities driving negotiations between nations in dierent hemispheres
10.8.2 Developing an Ethics of Sustainability
The 1987 United Nations Brundtland denition of sustainability21 embodies an intergenerational contract:
to provide for our present needs, while not compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
It's a modest enough proposal on the face of it, but it challenges our current expectations of the intergenerational contract: we expect each new generation to be better o than their parents. Decades of technological
advancement and economic growth have created a mindset not satised with mere sustainability. We might
call it turbo-materialism or a cornucopian worldview: namely that the earth's bounty, adapted to our use
by human ingenuity, guarantees a perpetual growth in goods and services. At the root of the cornucopian
worldview lies a brand of technological triumphalism, an unshakeable condence in technological innovation
to solve all social and environmental problems, be it world hunger, climate change, or declining oil reserves.
In sustainability discourse, there is a wide spectrum of opinion from the extremes of cornucopian optimism
on one side and to the doom-and-gloom scenarios that suggest it is already too late to avert a new Dark Age
of resource scarcity and chronic conict on the other.

For every generation entering a Dark Age, there were parents who enjoyed a better life, but who somehow
failed to pass along their prosperity. No one wants to fail their children in this way. To this extent, biology
dictates multigenerational thinking and ethics. Though it might not always be obvious, we are all already
the beneciaries of multi-generational planning. The world-leading American higher education system, for
example, depends upon an intergenerational structure and logica nancial and human investment in the
future committed to by multiple generations of Americans going back to the 19th century. But conversely,
in terms of vulnerability, just as higher education in the United States is neither necessarily permanent nor
universal, but a social institution built on an unwritten contract between generations, so the lifestyle benets
of advanced society as we know it will not simply perpetuate themselves without strenuous eorts to place
them on a sustainable footing.
Our current problem lies in the fact that multigenerational thinking is so little rewarded. Our economic
and political systems as they have evolved in the Industrial Age reward a mono-generational mindset driven
22http://www.library.ca.gov/calhist/

505
by short-term prots and election cycles. In the West, for example, there is no signicant political philosophy,
regulatory system, or body of law that enshrines the idea that we act under obligation to future generations,
despite widely held views that we naturally must. One challenge of sustainability is to channel our natural
biological interest in the future into a new ethics and politics based on multigenerational principles. Many
indigenous communities in the world, marginalized or destroyed by colonialism and industrialization, have
long recognized the importance of sustainability in principles of governance, and provide inspiring models.
The Great Law of the Iroquois Confederacy, for example, states that all decisions made by its elders should
be considered in light of their impact seven generations into the future.
To embrace an ethics of sustainability is to accept that our rapid industrialization has placed us in
the role of planetary managers, responsible for the health, or ruinous decline, of many of the globe's vital
ecosystems. This ethics requires we activate, in the popular sense, both sides of our brain. That is, we must
toggle between a rational consideration of our environmental footprint and practical issues surrounding the
reinvention of our systems of resource management, and a more humble, intuitive sense of our dependence
and embeddness within the web of life. Both reason and emotion come into play. Without emotion, there can
be no motivation for change. Likewise, without an intellectual foundation for sustainability, our desire for
change will be unfocused and ineective. We are capable of adapting to a complex world and reversing broadbased ecosystem decline. But to do so will require technical knowledge wedded to an ethical imagination.
We need to extend to the natural world the same moral sense we intuitively apply to the social world and
our relations with other people.
Sustainability ethics thus does not need to be invented from whole cloth. It represents, in some sense, a
natural extension of the ethical principles dominant in the progressive political movements of the 20th century,
which emphasized the rights of historically disenfranchised communities, such as women, African-Americans,
and the global poor. Just as we have been pressed to speak for dispossessed peoples who lack a political
voice, so we must learn the language of the nonhuman animal and organic world, of nature, and to speak
for it. Not simply for charity's sake, or out of seless concern, but for our own sake as resource-dependent
beings.
10.8.3 Remote Responsibilities
What distinguishes an ethics of sustainability from general ethical principles is its emphasis on remote
responsibilities, that is, our moral obligation to consider the impact of our actions on people and places
far removed from us. This distance may be measured in both space and time. First, in spatial terms, we, as
consumers in the developed world, are embedded in a global web of commerce, with an ethical responsibility
toward those who extract and manufacture the goods we buy, whether it be a polo shirt from Indonesia, or
rare metals in our computer extracted from mines in Africa. The economic and media dimensions of our
consumer society do not emphasize these connections; in fact, it is in the interests of consumer condence (a
major economic index) to downplay the disparities in living standards between the markets of the developed
world and the manufacturing countries of the global south (Africa, Asia, Latin America), which serve as the
factories of the world.
Second, as for sustainability ethics considered in temporal terms, the moral imagination required to
understand our remote responsibilities poses an even greater challenge. As we have seen, the landmark
United Nations Brundtland Report23 establishes an ethical contract between the living and those yet to
be born. For an industrial civilization founded on the no-limits extraction of natural resources and on
maximizing economic growth in the short term, this is actually a profoundly dicult challenge to meet.
More than that, the practical ethical dilemmas it poses to us in the present are complex. How, for instance,
are we to balance the objectives of economic development in poorer nationsthe need to lift the world's
bottom billion out of povertywith the responsibility to conserve resources for future generations, while at
the same time making the dicult transition from industrialized fossil fuels to a low-carbon global economy?
The issue of fairness with regard to individual nations' carbon emissions reduction mandates is a specic
example of how ethical issues can complicate, or even derail, negotiated treaties on environmental sustain23http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future

ability, even when the parties agree on the end goal. In the view of the developing countries of the global
south, many of them once subject to colonial regimes of the north, the advanced industrialized countries,
such as the United States and Europe, should bear a heavier burden in tackling climate change through selfimposed restraints on carbon consumption. They after all have been, over the last 200 years, the principal
beneciaries of carbon-driven modernization, and thus the source of the bulk of damaging emissions. For
them now to require developing nations to curb their own carbon-based modernization for the benet of the
global community reeks of neo-colonial hypocrisy. Developing nations such as India thus speak of common
but dierentiated responsibilities as the ethical framework from which to justly share the burden of
transition to a low-carbon global economy.
From the point of view of the rich, industrialized nations, by contrast, whatever the appearance of
historical injustice in a carbon treaty, all nations will suer signicant, even ruinous contractions of growth
if an aggressive mitigation agreement among all parties is not reached. Some commentators in the West have
further argued that the sheer scale and complexity of the climate change problem means it cannot eectively
be addressed through a conventional rights-based and environmental justice approach. To this degree at
least, the sustainability issue distinguishes itself as dierent in degree and kind from the landmark social
progressive movements of the 20th century, such as women's emancipation, civil rights, and multiculturalism,
to which it has often been compared.
Disputes over the complex set of tradeos between environmental conservation and economic development have dominated environmental policy and treaty discussions at the international level for the last half
century, and continue to stymie progress on issues such as climate change, deforestation, and biofuels. These
problems demonstrate that at the core of sustainability ethics lies a classic tragedy of the commons, namely,
the intractable problem of persuading individuals, or individual nations, to take specic responsibility for
resources that have few or no national boundaries (the atmosphere, the oceans), or which the global economy allows to be extracted from faraway countries, the environmental costs of which are thus externalized
(food, fossil fuels, etc). How the international community settles the problem of shared accountability for
a rapidly depleting global commons, and balances the competing objectives of economic development and
environmental sustainability, will to a large extent determine the degree of decline of the planet's natural
capital this century. One tragic prospect looms: If there is no international commitment, however patchwork, to protect the global resource commons, then the gains in economic prosperity, poverty alleviation and
public health in the developing world so hard won by international agencies over the second half of the 20th
century, will quickly be lost.

10.8.4 Precautionary Principle
The precautionary principle is likewise central to sustainability ethics. The margins of uncertainty are
large across many elds of the biophysical sciences. Simply put, there is a great deal we do not know about
the specic impacts of human activities on the natural resources of land, air, and water. In general, however,
though we might not have known where the specic thresholds of resilience lie in a given systemsay in
the sardine population of California's coastal watersthe vulnerability of ecosystems to human resource
extraction is a constant lesson of environmental history. A prosperous and vital economic engine, the
Californian sardine shery collapsed suddenly in the 1940s due to overshing. The precautionary principle
underlying sustainability dictates that in the face of high risk or insucient data, the priority should lie with
ecosystem preservation rather than on industrial development and market growth.

Sustainability, in instances such as these, is not a sexy concept. It's a hard sell. It is a philosophy of
limits in a world governed by dreams of innite growth and possibility. Sustainability dictates that we are
constrained by earth's resources as to the society and lifestyle we can have. On the other hand, sustainability
is a wonderful, inspiring concept, a quintessentially human idea. The experience of our own limits need not
be negative. In fact, what more primitive and real encounter between ourselves and the world than to feel
our essential dependence on the biospheric elements that surround us, that embeddedness with the air, the
light, the warmth or chill on our skins, and the stu of earth we eat or buy to propel ourselves over immense
distances at speed unimaginable to the vast armies of humanity who came before us.
Sustainability studies is driven by an ethics of the future. The word itself, sustainability, points to proofs
that can only be projected forward in time. To be sustainable is, by denition, to be attentive to what is to
come. So sustainability requires imagination, but sustainability studies is also a profoundly historical mode,
committed toreconstruction of the long, nonlinear evolutions of our dominant extractivist and instrumentalist
views of the natural world, and of the mind-forg'd manacles of usage and ideology that continue to limit
our ecological understanding and inhibit mainstream acceptance of the sustainability imperative.
Sustainability studies thus assumes the complex character of its subject, multiscalar in time and space,
and dynamically agile and adaptive in its modes. Sustainability teaches that the environment is not a
sideshow, or a scenic backdrop to our lives. A few more or less species. A beautiful mountain range here or
there. Our relation to our natural resources is the key to our survival. That's why it's called sustainability.

It's the grounds of possibility for everything else. Unsustainability, conversely, means human possibilities
and quality of life increasingly taken away from us and the generations to come.

Sustainable Infrastructure
11.1 Sustainable Infrastructure - Chapter Introduction1
11.1.1 Introduction
At present 80% of the US population lives in urban regions, a percentage that has grown steadily over the past
two hundred years. Urban infrastructures have historically supported several needs of the population served:
the supply of goods, materials and services upon which we rely; collection, treatment and disposal of waste
products; adequate transportation alternatives; access to power and communication grids; a quality public
education system; maintenance of a system of governance that is responsive, ecient and fair; generation of
sucient nancial and social capital to maintain and renew the region; and insurance of the basic elements
of safety and public health. Collectively, these needs have been perceived as the basic attributes needed to
make an urban region livable.
Urban infrastructures are designed and built in response to social needs and economies of scale that urbanization has brought about. Although our urban infrastructures are in many ways remarkable achievements
of engineering design that were conceived and built during times of rapid urbanization, as they have aged
and, inevitably, deteriorated; signicant strains on their function and ability to provide services have become
evident. In its program to identify the grand challenges facing society in the near future, the National
Academy of Engineering has proposed several focus areas, among them the restoration and improvement of
urban infrastructures. Such a challenge involves the need for renewal, but also presents opportunities for
re-envisioning the basis of infrastructure design and function as we move forward. Urban infrastructures of
the past were not generally conceived in concert with evolutionary social and ecological processes. This has
resulted in several characteristic attributes: conceptual models of infrastructure that perceive local ecological
systems either indierently or as obstacles to be overcome rather than assets for harmonious designs; a general reliance on centralized facilities; structures that often lack operational exibility such that alternative
uses may be precluded during times of crisis; heavy use of impervious and heat absorbing materials; systems
that have become increasingly costly to maintain and that are often excessively consumptive of natural
resources on a life cycle basis; and a built environment the materials and components of which are often
dicult to reuse or recycle.
The urban environment is an example of a complex human-natural system. The resiliency of such systems
lies in their capacity to maintain essential organization and function in response to disturbances (of both
long and short duration). A complimentary view, inspired by traditional ecological and economic thought
focuses on the degree of damage a system can withstand without exhibiting a regime shift, dened as a
transition that changes the structure and functioning of the system from one state to another as a result of
one or more independent factors. Upon exceeding a given threshold, the system shifts to a new alternative
state which may not be readily reversed through manipulation of causative factors. In the context of human1This content is available online at <http://cnx.org/content/m44985/1.1/>.

natural systems, regime shifts can have signicant consequences, and not all shifts are preferred by the
human component of the system. To the extent that change of some order is a given property of essentially
all dynamic systems, preferred resiliency might be viewed as the extent to which human societies can
adapt to such shifts with acceptable levels of impacts. Resilient infrastructures, then, are those which most
readily facilitate such adaptation. Much of the foregoing discussion also applies to sustainability, with the
added constraints of the sustainability paradigm: the equitable and responsible distribution of resources
among humans, present and future, in ways that do not harm, and ideally reinforce, the social and biological
systems upon which human society is based. Although there are important dierences between those two
concepts, there remains a close interrelationship that stems from the same need: to understand and design
urban infrastructural systems that enhance human interactions with the environment.
It is beyond the scope of this book to present an exhaustive treatment of the urban environment, indeed
there are many books and treatises on this topic. But in this chapter several important aspects of urban
resiliency and sustainability are presented, beginning with the concept of a sustainable city, and proceeding
through various elements of urban systems: buildings, energy and climate action planning, transportation,
and stormwater management. The chapter concludes with a case study of a net zero energy home, one in
which perhaps you can envision yourself inhabiting one day.

11.2.2 Introduction
Sustainability, from science to philosophy to lifestyle, nds expression in the way we shape our cities. Cities
are not just a collection of structures, but rather groups of people living dierent lifestyles together. When
we ask if a lifestyle is sustainable, we're asking if it can endure. Some archaeologists posit that environmental
imbalance doomed many failed ancient civilizations.
What could the sustainable city look like, how would it function, and how can we avoid an imbalance
that will lead to the collapse of our material civilization? This module will make some educated guesses
based upon the ideas and practices of some of today's bold innovators.
Throughout history settlement patterns have been set by technology and commerce. Civilizations have
produced food, clothing and shelter, and accessed foreign markets to purchase and sell goods. Workers
traditionally had to live near their place of occupation, although in modern industrial times advanced
transportation systems have enabled us to live quite a distance from where we work.

tions and how this equation was radically altered with the rise of the automobile following World War II.
While attempting to envision the Sustainable City we must discern what factors will inuence its shape
and form in the future.
11.2.3 Energy
For the last century energy has been aordable and plentiful, limited mainly by our technological ability to
use it. Contemporary civilization consumes 474 exajoules (474×1018 J=132,000 TWh). This is equivalent
to an average annual power consumption rate of 15 terawatts (1.504×1013 W).
The potential for renewable energy is: solar energy 1,600 EJ (444,000 TWh), wind power 600 EJ (167,000
Wh), geothermal energy 500 EJ (139,000 TWh), biomass 250 EJ (70,000 TWh), hydropower 50 EJ (14,000
TWh) and ocean energy 1 EJ (280 TWh).3
Even though it is possible to meet all of our present energy needs
with renewables, we do not do so because the way in which the market prices our fossil reserves. In the
current framework, when a company exploits resources it normally does not account for the loss of resource
base or for environmental damage. Gasoline has been cheap in the United States because its price does not
reect the cost of smog, acid rain, and their subsequent eects on health and the environment
let alone recognize that the oil reserves are being depleted. Scientists are working on fusion nuclear
energy; if that puzzle is solved energy will be aordable, plentiful and carbon neutral. See Environmental
and Resource Economics (Section 6.1) and Sustainable Energy Systems (Section 8.1) for more detail.
11.2.4 Materials & Waste
Scientists are producing materials not previously known to nature with unpredictable eects on bio-systems.
Some, such as dioxin, are highly toxic; others (e.g. xenoestrogens4
- which act as endocrine disruptors)
have more subtle eects. In the future the government will likely continue to expand its regulation of the
production, use and disposal of chemicals. Even heretofore benign processes, such as the production of
garbage and greenhouse gases, will probably need to be controlled as civilization exceeds the capacity of
natural systems to absorb and recycle our waste products.
Recycling and composting will reduce waste streams and material exchanges will take waste from one
group and transfer it eciently to others, thus reducing trash volume. Chicago's Rebuilding Exchange5
,
for instance, allows donors to take a tax deduction while it chargers buyers a greatly reduced fee to reuse
materials that would otherwise be sent to the landll. Although the Rebuilding Exchange is a physical
location, similar material exchanges could be virtual as they connect seller/donors to buyers/users online.
Old landlls might be mined as raw material use by a larger developed world (the addition of Asia's billions)
creates demand while technology drives down the cost of extraction. These modern economic realities, along
with the arrival of useful technology, represent the rise of collaborative consumption6
.
Long before modern lighting and HVAC systems were developed, buildings relied upon natural light and
ventilation. With support from a growing body of science supporting the public health benets, contemporary
designers are rediscovering the role biophilia  the human anity for nature  plays in the spaces we occupy.
When adjacent to residential areas, green spaces have been shown to create neighborhoods with fewer violent
and property crimes and where neighbors tend to support and protect one another.
Studies have shown that natural daylight increases commercial sales
and green schools improve test scores
. Biomimicry is also part of the green revolution. The idea behind biomimicry is that nature has already
solved many of the challenges that face us. One example is the development of new friction-free surfaces,
modeled on the slippery skin of the Arabian Peninsula's sandsh lizard, an advance that could eliminate
the use of ball bearings in many products as well as industrial diamond dust in automobile air bags. The
pearl oyster uses carbon dioxide to construct its calcium carbonate shell, so a Canadian company developed

a technology that reduces large amounts of CO2
in cement production. 300,000 buildings in Europe use
self-cleaning glass that mimics the way water balls up on lotus leaves and simply rolls o.
In the future, we should see more of a return to natural systems as well as the use of new materials that
mimic nature in our sustainable city.
11.2.5 Social Equity
Perhaps the most signicant development that separates sustainability from its conservation antecedents is
the element of social equity. The environmental and conservation movements have been criticized in the past
for being too "white collar" and promoting the interests of the haves; these movements have traditionally
not dealt with the needs of the underclass in the U.S. and, especially, developing countries. In Agenda
217
, the manifesto of the Earth Summit8
conference on the environment held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,
sustainable development was viewed as the strategy that would be needed to increase the basic standard of
living of the world's expanding population without unnecessarily depleting our nite natural resources and
further degrading the environment upon which we all depend.
The challenge, as viewed at the Earth Summit, was posed in terms of asking humanity to collectively
step back from the brink of environmental collapse and, at the same time, lift its poorest members up to the
level of basic human health and dignity.
The concept of ecological footprint asks each of us to limit resource use to our equitable share. Sitting
on the apex of civilization the Western world is being asked to share the earth's bounty with the masses
of Asia, South America and Africa. If technology continues to advance we can do this without signicant
long-term degradation of our standard of living. Short-term economic dislocations are inevitable, however,
as increasing demand from China and India bring us to peak oil and rising transportation costs will highlight
the nexus between location eciency and aordable housing. The Center for Neighborhood Technology9
,
for instance, has mapped 337 metropolitan areas10 covering 80% of the United States population showing
how ecient (near mass transit) locations reduce the cost of living (housing + utilities transportation) and
vice versa. The reality of rising transportation costs could have a signicant impact on the shape of the city.
Lookin target-id="targetid"g backward we also realize that racial politics were one of the dynamics that
fueled suburban expansion in the 50's and 60's decimating many of our urban centers. The Sustainable City
of the future, if it works, will have stably integrated mixed income neighborhoods.
11.2.6 Technology
Computers brought intelligence to the Machine Age and transformed it into the Information Age. Markets
run on information and better information will help the markets perform more eciently. Whereas in
the past surrogate measures were developed to guess at impacts, information technology can track actual
use. For example, do we charge everyone the same fee for water and sewers or do we measure their use,
charge proportionally, and thus encourage landowners to reduce their use? In Miami the (congestion pricing)
charge for driving in the special lanes goes up instantaneously with actual trac conditions. As the old adage
goes, What gets measured gets managed, and as technology increases the precision to which environmental
measures, consumption, and behavior increases, our ability to manage, and therefore reduce negative impacts,
will increase.
In the past humans have been one of the beasts of burden and workers have been needed to produce and
move goods. Modern factories reduce human labour needs and articial intelligence will soon carry most of
the load in our partnership with machines. In the Information Age humans should no longer have to live
and work near the factories and centers of commerce and jobs will move from the production of goods to
the provision of services. People may choose to live in exciting urban centers, but if one wants a bucolic life
style telework will oer an alternative.

Many American cities have declined in population from highs immediately following World War II, even
as the host metropolitan area has continued to grow. While populations have declined poverty and other
social problems have been concentrated.11 In the United States, nearly 5,000,000 acres of vacant property
(including brownelds) exist. This is equivalent to the combined land area of the nation's 60 largest cities.

Some commentators postulate that green infrastructure oers a better model for improving these cities
health.
How could these factors manifest themselves in our sustainable city? They will inuence its design and
our settlement patterns will inuence our lifestyles. You are not only what you eat but also where you live.
For instance:
11.2.8 Transportation
Most agree that walkability is a key component of any sustainable neighborhood. Walkability not only
reduces energy use, but also increases public health. How can we measure walkability? Walkscore.com12
identies and measures nearby amenities and provides a rating for specic locations and neighborhoods. Try
it for where you live.
Sustainable cities could consist of walkable neighborhoods that separate pedestrian, bike and vehicular
trac and are connected to each other through multiple transportation modes, with biking and mass transit
choices in addition to the automobile. Instead of averaging 10 (auto) trips per unit per day
most residents would not use an automobile daily and instead walk or bike or order online. Trip generation
would be reduced through telework and ecommerce. Goods would be brought to residents in bulk delivery
trucks using services like UPS, Fedex and Peapod. Under telework many would only visit an oce to attend
meetings once or twice a week (or less). Streets and intersections would be made less daunting to pedestrians
through trac calming techniques.

Most trips to other parts of the city would be made via mass transit. When an individual car is need it
would be provided through car sharing, or taxis. Much to the dismay of science ction fans, ying cars sound
nice but it is dicult to see how they can be sustainable until a non-polluting, renewable energy source for
air travel is obtained. Trac congestion would be relieved not through articial subsidies (overbuilding roads
and providing free parking) but through congestion pricing, removal of free street parking, and providing
viable bicycle and mass transit alternatives.
Even rural centers could be planned as concentrated walkable neighborhoods with viable transportation
options. Telework, e-commerce and low impact cluster development would enable residents to enjoy
country living without a guilty conscience. Think in terms of a kibbutz (collective farm) where most members
do not own their own cars and rarely have to use this type of transportation.
Cities will continue to draw entrepreneurs and foster productivity.
Most of the population will reside in mega-regions and linking them through high-speed rail that connects
to mass transit will be the key to long-term economic growth.

11.2.9 Water
Traditional approaches have sought to rapidly move stormwater away from what we've built via gutters,
sewers and articial channels. While this approach on the micro scale is intended to prevent local ooding
and undesired ponding, on the macro scale it may actually cause area wide ooding. It also short-circuits
the opportunity for water to naturally soak into the ground  to water plants and recharge groundwater
resources
, and, with traditional planting of lawns and other exotics, necessitates bringing more water in for
irrigation.
Best water management practices for sustainable cities would include:
• Green Roofs
• Downspouts, Rain Barrels and Cisterns
• Permeable Paving
• Natural Landscaping
• Filter Strips
• Bioinltration using: Rain Gardens
• Drainage Swales
• Naturalized Detention Basins

These features are discussed in more detail in the Module Sustainable Stormwater Management (Section 11.6). The sustainable city would recharge its local aquifer and surface water would ow primarily
from groundwater and not storm water discharge. Instead of charging a at tax for storm and sanitary
sewer services, technology allows districts to charge usage fees based upon volume, thus providing a nancial
incentive for sustainable design. Governmental bodies could use these tools to encourage the reorientation
and designers could use the techniques outlined above as divert stormwater into the ground rather than
directly into surface water.17
Working together, local government and project planners could also retrot older urban streets with
attractive walkable streetscapes, just as Lansing, Michigan has done as part of its combined sewer overow
project18 (below).

creating a series of Eco-Boulevards that function as a giant Living Machine  treating the city's waste and
storm water naturally, using micro-organisms, small invertebrates such as snails, sh, and plants. Under
their plan treated water would be returned to the Great Lakes Basin and create a closed water loop within
Chicago, instead of being exported to the Mississippi and Gulf Coast.
11.2.10 Food
The ancients would wonder at modern supermarkets with their food from all over the world and fresh fruits
and vegetables all year round. Yet most environmental activists advocate locally produced organic food.
Peak oil will raise petrochemical costs and upset the dynamics of modern agriculture, but it will be dicult
to change the acquired tastes of the consuming public.
USEPA is encouraging urban agriculture as one of the solutions to the shrinking city.
It sees urban agriculture as not only providing a use for vacant land, (thus addressing blight and the
deleterious aect of neglect on property values) but also as a potential cleanup strategy for contamination.
It addresses the problem of food deserts (lack of healthy, aordable, fresh produce) in blighted inner city
neighborhoods while educating children and adults about farming and local enterprise. Practitioners have
found that urban farming enhances social capital and community connections. Victory gardens produced
about 40% of American vegetables consumed during World War II
and urban gardens could be a prime user of the compost that we could generate either through individual
compost bins or through collective eorts performed on a large scale by our waste haulers.

Many of us might belong to food cooperatives where the members contract with organic farmers to
purchase the food grown for them.
In Sustainable Cities farming will not just be an interim land use in blighted neighborhoods but, like
Prairie Crossing in Grayslake, Illinois23 , will be an integral part of the community plan. Some even forecast
vertical farming24 in the great cities of the world.

11.2.11 Buildings & Neighborhoods
Americans have come a long way from the pioneer one room log cabin and crowded immigrant tenement. The
average American house size has more than doubled since the 1950s and now stands at 2,349 square feet.25
Sustainability will probably mean more ecient use of smaller homes, and McMansions might become
multi-family dwellings, putting pressure on local ordinances and home association rules.

Second (& third) homes? The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University showed a dramatic
rise in vacation homes, from 3.1 million such units in the 1990 Census to over 6 million in the Housing
Vacancy Survey ten years later.
If we want to equitably share the world's resources with emerging markets we'll have to gure out how
to manage this desire to spend time in more than one place in a more conservative manner. Time-sharing
addresses this need, as does the (still) growing hotel and vacation resort industry.
Homes use about 23% of all energy in the United States.

In the future many of our homes will generate their own power (See Case Study: A Net-Zero Energy
Home in Urbana, Illinois (Section 11.7)). Today ultra-ecient homes combine state-of-the-art, energyecient construction and appliances with commercially available renewable energy systems, such as solar
water heating and solar electricity, so that the net energy use is zero or even less than zero (positive energy
production).
There have been eorts since the 70's oil crisis to promote (mandatory) energy codes, but voluntary
eorts such as Energy Star and LEED are the ones that have made substantial headway.
LEED
 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, a voluntary eort by the U.S. Green Building Council
, includes more than energy and also gives points for site, water, materials and resources, and indoor air
quality. LEED in particular and sustainable construction in general have found widespread acceptance as
even the National Association of Homebuilders has rolled out its own version of green construction
. Since its inception in 1998, the U.S. Green Building Council has grown to encompass more than 10,000
projects in the United States and 117 countries covering 8 billion square feet of construction space and in
April, 2011 LEED certied its 10,000th home in its LEED for Homes program
. The U.S government's General Services Administration (GSA), the part of the federal government that
builds and manages federal space, currently requires LEED Gold certication for all of its new buildings (up
from Silver).
In addition to using fewer resources sustainable buildings reduce absenteeism, improve employee morale,
and lead to improved educational performance.
In the Pacic Northwest the International Living Future Institute has set up a Living Building Challenge
to go beyond LEED and design and build triple net zero (storm water, energy, wastewater) structures. As
of Fall 2010 there were 70 registered projects
.
What about the neighborhoods where we live and raise our families? Many now recognize that our
grandparents' mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods were more sustainable than today's reality. The Congress
for New Urbanism
promotes mixed use in contrast to its predecessor, Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM),
which promoted separation of use. CIAM, active in the rst part of the 20th century, proposed that the
social problems faced by cities could be resolved by strict functional segregation, and the distribution of the
population into tall apartment blocks at widely spaced intervals.
This view found its expression in Le Corbusier's The Radiant City (1935). Separation of Use heavily
inuenced subdivision and building codes that, in turn, shaped Post World War II suburban expansion. In
our suburbs zoning dictates mutually exclusive uses in each district so that Industrial use is exclusive of
commercial, which is exclusive of residential. In the suburbs separation of use combined with the platting of
superblocks to replace the traditional grid network gives us a lifestyle that produces 10 auto trips per unit
per day, because you need one car per driver to get around where much of America lives.
CIAM's view also formed the intellectual underpinning for large-scale high-rise public housing projects.
Today we recognize that safe, sound and sanitary housing is not just indoor plumbing and more bedrooms,
and that aordable housing is not just rent but includes utility and transportation costs and the right to live
in a safe, mixed income, stably integrated neighborhood. Our sustainable city should stand upon the leg of
social equity and include ethnic and income diversity. Neighborhoods should be sited at ecient locations
with broad transportation choices. What will they look like? Most new urbanists think they will be
similar to the diverse neighborhoods built at the turn of the last century. Other visionaries, such as Moshe
Safdie, think it possible to integrate the variety and diversity of scattered private homes with the economics
and density of a modern apartment building. Modular, interlocking concrete forms in Safdie's Expo '67
dened the space. The project was designed to create aordable housing with close but private quarters,
each equipped with a garden. In a dierent vein, in outlying Grayslake, Illinois, cluster development that
incorporates open space, wetlands, and a working organic farm enables residents to live (somewhat) sustainably in the country. Our future must recognize that we don't want everyone to live in Manhattan or
Brooklyn, and we must provide for diverse tastes and lifestyles.

526 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
Will everything look futuristic, like the sets of Blade Runner or Star Wars? Historic Buildings not
only have a special charm but they represent a great deal of embodied energy that is wasted if they are
demolished. The government and marketplace will probably continue to promote historic rehab, including
adaptive reuse where new uses are found for old buildings through rehab that installs modern utilities and
xtures while preserving the outer shell's look and feel. In Chicago the Sears Powerhouse was converted to a
charter school and in Philadelphia Urban Outtters took the old Navy Yard and transformed it into a new
corporate headquarters. In all ve of the former Navy Yard buildings, employees work in light-lled interiors
with open layouts. Most of the furnishings are custom-made and contain recycled material (tabletops crafted
from salvaged wood, for instance). Amenities such as a gym, yoga studio, dog park, and farmers' market
further add to the lively and informal atmosphere.
All of these gestures to what the CEO calls a quality of life thing help Urban Outtters boost employee
satisfaction. Since moving into the new headquarters, employee turnover has dropped to 11 percent, and fewer
sick days are being used. They feel more linked to the community and culture of the company. The campus
has improved his company's ability to attract new talent. The informal atmosphere is alluring to Millennialaged employees, who tend to value open, exible work arrangements more than previous generations of
workers. The campus has improved creative collaboration, which ultimately impacts our bottom line.
11.2.12 Work and Commuting
In the past we had to live near the places where we built things and conducted our business. The factories of
the industrial revolution demanded labor, and packed the exploited workforce in nearby tenement housing.
Today intelligent machines perform most of the work in manufacturing our goods and moving them from
place to place. In the Information Age most tasks can be performed anywhere within reach of the World
Wide Web. In Understanding Media Marshall McLuhan showed how improved roads and transport have
reversed the ancient pattern and made cities the centers of work and the country the place of leisure and of
recreation.
 The new reality once again reverses roles by locating the factories on vast campuses away from the
people and, the city becomes a place to meet, be entertained and educated. Sustainable Cities of the future
will probably still function as the center for service industries such as health and beauty care, hospitality,
tourism, travel, and government, and other service industries, such as insurance, advertising and marketing,
and nancial services, are amenable to telework. Sure, we can eat our frozen dinners and get TV or on line
entertainment at home, but it's still enjoyable to go out to eat and catch a live show, concert, sporting event
or movie. We get a better view of the players on television, but the excitement of thousands of fans under
one roof is palpable. Many of us in the postindustrial Information Age will not have to live near our
factories, power plants or transportation centers, because we just have to connect to the World Wide Web.
In the Information Age many of us might never have to attend physical meetings, but those of us who do
might nd ourselves going to the oce only a few times a month. But it is important for those who tout
cities as more sustainable places to live (i.e. Cities pollute less per capita28 ) to understand that rural areas
can be just as benign as cities if one has the will and controls resource use with the appropriate life style.
Communal farms, for example, generally have small ecological footprints, producing more resources than
they consume.

528 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
11.2.13 Power
Today huge plants generate electricity from coal (44.9%), natural gas (23.8%), atomic energy (19.6%),
hydroelectric (6.2%), and other renewable (e.g. wind, solar) (4%) sources.
Power aects urban form in that urban centers must be connected to the grid, and the ubiquitous power
line tethers us to the power plant. Sustainable cities will probably not lose the grid, but should accommodate
those who want to produce their own power by running the meter backwards. Until and unless atomic fusion
supplies cheap, safe, reliable power, renewables will compete with fossil fuels. Even as we hit peak oil, coal
will be plentiful for the foreseeable future. Coal will continue to be cheap because its price will probably not
reect all the costs of smog, acid rain, and its subsequent eects on health and the environment 31 let alone
recognize that the reserves are being depleted. As the technology evolves and as government policy requires
utilities to buy power from small decentralized sources we will all get used to wind mills and photovoltaic
arrays. Geothermal heat pumps will heat and cool space more eciently. Zoning and building codes will
have to be revised to deal with solar access rights, noise from windmills and odors from biomass and biofuels.

Technology will also enable us to operate more eciently. One of the problems with conventional power
generation is that the plants must be (over)sized to accommodate peak loads. In the future the Smart
Grid should smooth peak loads by instructing consumer appliances to perform tasks, such as laundry and
dishwashing, in low demand periods (middle of the night), and will oer lower rates as an incentive.

11.2.14 Commerce
Our parents and grandparents have seen dramatic change in the area of commerce. Until 1950 we walked to
the neighborhood store and most of the goods we bought were produced locally. On special occasions you'd
take the trolley downtown to the central business district (CBD) to visit the large department stores (e.g.
Marshall Fields in Chicago, Macy's in New York). With the suburbanization following World War II CBD's
were replaced by suburban malls. We drove to the malls. The CBD's died out. For the last thirty years big
box chains have dominated retail, but most recently ecommerce entices consumers with better selection and
prices (and sometimes no sales tax). Most of us nd that we shop online more eciently and those that need
the personal attention that retail establishments currently oer might nd that they will have to engage the

531
services of a personal shopper (note the shift from good to service). Most of the goods we purchase, even
food, have been produced somewhere else. World trade, as measured in US dollars at current prices, has
grown astronomically, from $10.1 billion in 1900
, to $62 billion in 1950, to $15.2 trillion in 2010. US imports and exports have risen from $1.4 billion
(exports) in 1900 to $9.6/10.3 billion in 1950 and to $1.97/1.28 trillion in 2010.
In our Sustainable City of the Future ecommerce will probably rule, which will mean a reduction in actual
physical commercial oor area. When we feel we need to see something in person we will visit centralized
showrooms, and pay for that service, but most purchases will be made on line and the product delivered
either by company delivery vehicles (e.g. Peapod) or through common carriers (e.g. UPS, Fedex). New uses
will be found for dead malls.
Neighborhood stores will fare better in walkable neighborhoods, especially those that oer services in
place of or in addition to goods.
It is unreasonable for us to expect to obtain all of our goods locally, but regional specialization in the
production of goods will reect climate, access to raw materials and markets, and locally developed expertise
rather than cheap labor and the ability to avoid environmental and workplace safety regulations. Modern
robots do not have to follow repetitive assembly line logic of repeated application of the same exact set
of instructions. They can be programmed to intelligently consider each individual product and thus can
produce a wider variety of products, and many products will be special ordered to t individual tastes. Once
we even out the playing eld (of necessary government regulation to deal with the externalities of production)
the cost of shipping should work towards more local production. Goods will be made just in time
thus reducing inventories and overproduction that is sent to landlls. Eciency will be a big part of the
Sustainable City.
Planned obsolescence and its impact upon material culture is more problematic. Fashion dees logic but
speaks to the most basic instincts of human behavior. How do we avoid the need for more closet space,
let alone osite storage? New materials will enable us to change the look and feel of clothing. Advances in
crystal technology, for example, will allow us to change its color and/or pattern.
Interlocking parts using material similar to Velcro could let us change lapels, sleeves and other components
of garments, much as we now add or subtract liners for warmth. More complicated goods will be designed
for disassembly and recycling,
or replacement of key parts while keeping most of the old components. Retrot can add life to old
buildings and machines, if we learn to view old and retro as cool and in.
A good example of how we can move towards sustainability is provided by Interface, which repositioned
their carpeting business from the sale of goods to the leasing of oor covering services. Under the old
paradigm the consumer purchased a new carpet a few years after the old one began to show wear. The
selection was based upon the perception that the carpet would last (e.g. because it felt thicker), but the
reality was that the carpet manufacturer made out better when new carpets had to be repurchased more
frequently. Under the new leasing paradigm the manufacturer owns the carpet and therefore it is in their
best interest to have it last longer. Interface's Solenium lasts four times longer and uses 40% less material
than ordinary carpets, an 86% reduction in materials intensity. When marketed as oor covering services
under its Evergreen Lease, modular oor tiles are replaced as soon as they show any wear and, since 80% of
wear takes place on 20% of the area, this reduces material intensity by another 80%. In other words, 3%of
the materials are used under the new paradigm (yes, a 97% reduction) than the old one. And the worn out
panels are recycled, and no chlorine or other toxic materials are used in its manufacture.37
11.2.15 Education
Our children will nd their place in tomorrow's workplace based upon their brains, not brawn. Education is
the most important component in preparing for tomorrow's workplace. Classrooms today link via television
and the internet to amazing resources. More importantly, articial intelligence has the capacity to treat
each student as an individual and to tailor instruction to meet his or her individual abilities and needs, in
contrast to the classroom that moves, at best, at the speed of the average student.

textbooks in the form of tablet PCs. Source: By B.C. (Own work) [CC-BY-3.038] via Wikimedia Commons39
The sustainable school should still contain classrooms, but it will probably be supplemented by individualized computer learning labs. Each student would have their own personal computer (see Cyborgean Man
below) that would link them to the internet. Classrooms would have multi-media capabilities that would
link to other classrooms around the world. Webinars would make expert instruction available to all. As
noted earlier, the biophilia of green classrooms would improve learning and test scores.
11.2.16 Cyborgean Man & Big Brother
In his book Understanding Media  The Extensions of Man Marshall McLuhan explains how once man
creates an extension of himself, let's say writing, he both gains (the ability to remember more in his records)
and loses (not being able to remember as much without these written records) abilities.
Horse drawn carriages and automobiles enable man to travel faster and further even as his body gains
weight and loses muscle tone. Tents, tepees and igloos enable man to migrate from the primordial forest40
to inhospitable climates, but man, like the tortoise, must lug this shell of material civilization around with
him.

Miniaturization in the Computer Age now promises to let us reinternalize some of the external abilities
we've created. Over ten years ago Thad Starner, a research assistant at MITs media lab, garnered a lot of
publicity by calling himself a cyborg because he incorporated his computer monitor into his glasses, and let
his keyboard and computer hang as appendages by his side.
Today half the civilized world has smartphones that link us via the Facebook, the World Wide Web,
texts and tweets. In our sustainable city we could all be wired, possibly though implants directly into out
brainstem. Articial intelligence could provide a virtual butler that would be available to schedule and
keep track of our appointments, order our groceries and other items, and help us with things we can't even
imagine today. Advertising would be directed at us individually, as in Philip Dick's Minority Report
, as advertisers use software like doubleclick
and links to national databases (see Big Brother below) to track who we are and our buying preferences.
This should be good for sustainability, as there will be no need to hoard things for possible future use, and
to discard them when we no longer need them. Government would nd it easier to poll citizen's preferences
and opinions.

In George Orwell's 1984 everyone is constantly reminded, Big Brother is watching you.
In our sustainable city everyone will be watching everyone else. Video surveillance webcams might be
everywhere, and everyone would have access to them. Everyone could have a reality show in which those
wanting to follow you would merely tune into the appropriate URL and be able to choose the cameras and
microphones that are in range. Some people would not even turn o the feeds, ever. Articial intelligence (or
actual humans for the more popular content) could provide edited condensed feeds. Crime would go down
in those areas with eyes and ears, but crime will evolve and persist. It will be easy to research everyone you
meet and to stay connected. Since this will be by and large electronic it will promote a sustainable lifestyle
by not consuming additional resources.

11.3 Sustainability and Buildings42
11.3.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the various ways buildings aect the environment
• describe the characteristics of sustainable buildings
11.3.2 Introduction
Buildings present a challenge and an opportunity for sustainable development. According to the most
recent available Annual Energy Outlook from the U.S. Environmental Information Administration, buildings
account for about 39% of the carbon dioxide emissions, 40% of primary energy use, and 72% of the electricity
consumption in the U.S. Additional information from the U.S. Geological Survey indicates that 14% of the
potable water consumption occurs in buildings.
Globally, buildings are the largest contributors to carbon dioxide emissions, above transportation and
then industry. The construction of buildings requires many materials that are mined, grown, or produced and
then transported to the building site. Buildings require infrastructure including roads, utility lines, water
and sewer systems. People need to be able to get to and from buildings to work, live, or take advantage of
the services provided within them. They need to provide a safe and comfortable environment for the people
that inhabit them.

It is possible to design and construct fully functional buildings that have far fewer negative environmental
impacts than current norms allow. Beyond benetting the environment, green buildings provide economic
benets including reduced operating costs, expanded markets for green products and services, improved
building occupant productivity, and optimized life-cycle performance. Green buildings also oer social
benets that range from protecting occupant comfort and health, to better aesthetic qualities, less strain on
local infrastructure, and overall improvement in quality of life.
In 1994, a group of experts was brought together by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
to develop a pathway and specic principles for sustainable development. According to these principles,
building should be:
• Ecologically Responsive: The design of human habitat shall recognize that all resources are limited,
and will respond to the patterns of natural ecology. Land plans and building designs will include only
those with the least disruptive impact upon the natural ecology of the earth. Density must be most
intense near neighborhood centers where facilities are most accessible.
• Healthy, Sensible Buildings: The design of human habitat must create a living environment that
will be healthy for all its occupants. Buildings should be of appropriate human scale in a non-sterile,
aesthetically pleasing environment. Building design must respond to toxicity of materials, care with
EMF, lighting eciency and quality, comfort requirements and resource eciency. Buildings should
be organic, integrate art, natural materials, sunlight, green plants, energy eciency, low noise levels
and water. They should not cost more than current conventional buildings.
• Socially Just: Habitats shall be equally accessible across economic classes.
• Culturally Creative: Habitats will allow ethnic groups to maintain individual cultural identities and
neighborhoods while integrating into the larger community. All population groups shall have access to
art, theater and music.
• Beautiful: Beauty in a habitat environment is necessary for the soul development of human beings.
It is yeast for the ferment of individual creativity. Intimacy with the beauty and numinous mystery of
nature must be available to enliven our sense of the sacred.
• Physically and Economically Accessible: All sites within the habitat shall be accessible and rich
in resources to those living within walkable (or wheelchair-able) distance.
• Evolutionary: Habitats' design shall include continuous re-evaluation of premises and values, shall
be demographically responsive and exible to change over time to support future user needs. Initial
designs should reect our society's heterogeneity and have a feedback system.

What is meant by a sustainable or green building? The U.S. EPA denes green building as the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-ecient throughout
a building's life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. This practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility,
durability, and comfort. (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010 (p. 550))
The benets of sustainable buildings have already been documented. These buildings can reduce energy
use by 24-50%, carbon dioxide emissions by 33-39%, water use by 40%, and solid waste by 70% (Turner &
Frankel, 2008 (p. 550); Kats, Alevantis, Berman, Mills, & Perlman, 2003 (p. 550); Fowler & Rauch, 2008
(p. 549)). Green building occupants are healthier and more productive than their counterparts in other
buildings, and this is important because in the U.S, people spend an average of 90% or more of their time
indoors (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1987 (p. 550)). Green buildings tend to have improved
indoor air quality and lighting.
There are also numerous perceived business benets to green buildings, including decreased operating
costs and increased building value, return on investment, occupancy ratio, and rent ratio.
11.3.3 Materials and Methods of Construction
It is frequently stated that the most sustainable building is the one that is not built. This does not mean
that we should not have buildings, but rather that we should make the most of our existing buildings. Those
buildings already have the infrastructure and have utilized many materials for their construction.
A great deal of energy goes into making building materials. By volume, the major materials used within
the U.S. construction industry are crushed rock, gravel, sand, cement, cement concrete, asphalt concrete,
timber products, clay brick, concrete block, drywall, roong materials, steel, aluminum, copper and other
metals, plastics, paper, paints, glues, and other chemical products. The building industry has been the
largest consumer of materials in the US for nearly 100 years (Horvath, 2004 (p. 549)).
The manufacturing of cement, for instance, is an enormous producer of greenhouse gas emissions. Cement
is made of about 85% lime by mass, which is mixed with other ingredients such as shale, clay, and slate. It
is formed into an inorganic adhesive by heating the ingredients to a temperature of 1450 ◦C (2640 ◦F), and
then grinding the product into a powder. Cement comprises about 15% of concrete, which is made by mixing
cement with sand, small rocks, and water. Because it requires so much energy, the manufacture of cement
is estimated to account for as much as 5% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Humphreys &
Mahasenan, 2002 (p. 550)).
Construction of buildings is also related to deforestation. Our consumption of wood to build buildings
and furniture over the centuries has resulted in the clearing of many old-world forests and tropical forests.
Trees are harvested not only for fuel but also for construction material and to clear land for construction.
The demolition of old buildings to make way for new and construction projects themselves generate huge
amounts of waste. Careful deconstruction of buildings allows for reuse of materials in future construction
projects or for recycling of materials into new building (and other) products. Deconstruction creates economic
advantages by lower building removal costs due to value of materials and avoided disposal costs, reduces
impact to site on soil and vegetation, conserves landll space, and creates jobs due to the labor-intensity of
the process.
A 1998 EPA study (p. 550) of building-related construction and demolition (C&D) debris generation in
the U.S. found that an estimated 136 million tons of building-related C&D debris were generated in 1996, the
equivalent to 2.8 pounds per person per day. 43% of the waste (58 million tons per year) was generated from
residential sources and 57% (78 million tons per year) was from nonresidential sources. Building demolitions
accounted for 48% of the waste stream, or 65 million tons per year; renovations accounted for 44%, or 60
million tons per year; and 8 percent, or 11 million tons per year, was generated at construction sites.
Even when deconstruction is not possible, the waste can be recycled by sorting the materials after they
are collected and taken to a waste transfer station. Since new construction and renovation requires the
input of many materials, this is an opportunity to utilize products that enhance the sustainability of the
building. These products may be made of recycled content, sustainably grown and harvested wood and
pulp materials, products that have low emissions, and products that are sourced locally. These products

enhance the sustainability of the building by supporting local economies and reducing the fuel needed to
transport them long distances.
11.3.4 Energy-saving Building Features
Energy ecient measures have been around a long time and are known to reduce the use of energy in
residential and commercial properties. Improvements have been made in all of these areas and are great
opportunities for further innovation. Green buildings incorporate these features to reduce the demand for
heating and cooling.
11.3.5
11.3.5.1 Insulation
The building should be well insulated and sealed so that the conditioned air doesn't escape to the outside.
Insulation can be installed in oors, walls, attics and/or roofs. It helps to have more even temperature
distribution and increased comfort as well.
11.3.5.2 High-performance Windows
Several factors are important to the performance of a window (see Figure A High-performance Window
(Figure 11.13)):
• Thermal windows are at least double-paned and vacuum-lled with inert gas. This gas provides
insulation
• Improved framing materials, weather stripping and warm edge spacers reduce heat gain and loss
• Low-E coating block solar heat gain in the summer and reect radiant heat indoors during the winter
11.3.5.3 Sealing of Holes and Cracks
Sealing holes and cracks in a building's envelope as well as the heating and cooling duct systems can reduce
drafts, moisture, dust, pollen, and noise. In addition, it improves comfort and indoor air quality at the same
time it saves energy and reduces utility and maintenance costs.

542 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
11.3.5.4 Heating Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC)
A large part of the energy consumption and thus environmental impact of a building is the building heating,
ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems that are used to provide comfortable temperature, humidity
and air supply levels. Buildings must be designed to meet local energy code requirements, but these are
often not as aggressive targets as they could be to demand more energy eciency. In the U.S. ENERGY
Star provides guidance and benchmarking to help set more aggressive goals.
There are many ways HVAC systems can be designed to be more ecient. Variable air volume (VAV)
systems increase air ow to meet the increase or decrease in heat gains or losses within the area served.
Having fans power down when not needed saves energy, as does reducing the amount of air that needs to be
conditioned and also reduces the need for reheat systems. These systems are used to warm up an area if the
cooled air supply is making an area too cold. VAV systems can generally handle this by reducing air supply.
All of this does need to be balanced by making sure there is enough fresh air supply to meet the needs of
the number of occupants in a building. Otherwise, it will feel stuy due to lack of air ow and oxygen.
Also using automated controls, whether it is a programmable thermostat in your home or a building
automation system (BAS) that uses computers to control HVAC settings based on schedules and occupancy,
can signicantly reduce energy consumption.
The equipment itself can be made more energy ecient. For instance new home furnaces range in
eciency from 68-97%. Ideally, the most energy ecient furnace would be installed in a new home (U.S.
Department of Energy, 2011 (p. 550)).
11.3.5.5 Passive Solar Design
This type of architectural design does not require mechanical heating and cooling of a building. Instead it
uses heating and cooling strategies that have been used historically such as natural ventilation, solar heat
gain, solar shading and ecient insulation. Figure Passive Solar Design (Figure 11.14) shows some of
these elements. In the winter solar radiation is trapped by the greenhouse eect of south facing windows
(north in the southern hemisphere) exposed to full sun. Heat is trapped, absorbed and stored by materials
with high thermal mass (usually bricks or concrete) inside the house. It is released at night when needed
to warm up the building as it loses heat to the cooler outdoors. Shading provided by trees or shades keeps
the sun out in the hot months.

11.3.5.6 Lighting
Well-designed lighting can minimize the use of energy. This includes enhancing day lighting (natural light),
through windows, skylights, etc. Using energy ecient lighting such as compact uorescent light bulbs and
LEDs (light-emitting diodes) can save energy as well. Using occupancy sensors also means that lights will
only be on when someone is in a room. See Module Sustainable Energy Practices: Climate Action Planning
(Section 11.4) for more energy-saving technologies that can be incorporated into buildings.
11.3.5.7 Water
Water usage can be minimized by using low-ow xtures in restrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens. Dual-ush
toilets allow for the user to have the option of select less water (e.g. for liquid waste) and more water (e.g. for
solid waste) when ushing (See Figure Dual Flush Toilet (Figure 11.15)). These have long been in use in
Europe, the Middle East and other places where water conservation is paramount. Fresh water consumption
can be reduced further through the use of greywater systems. These systems recycle water generated from
activities such as hand washing, laundry, bathing, and dishwashing for irrigation of grounds and even for
ushing toilets.

11.3.5.8 Integrated Design
Integrated design is a design process for a building that looks at the whole building, rather than its individual parts, for opportunities to reduce environmental impact. Incremental measures would include those
approaches described above. To accomplish integrated design of a building, all parties involved in the
designarchitects, engineers, the client and other stakeholdersmust work together. This collaborative approach results in a more harmonious coordination of the dierent components of a building such as the site,
structure, systems, and ultimate use.
11.3.6 Standards of Certication
Most countries establish certain standards to assure consistency, quality and safety in the design and construction of buildings. Green building standards provide guidelines to architects, engineers, building operators and owners that enhance building sustainability. Various green building standards have originated in
dierent countries around the world, with diering goals, review processes and rating. In this section we will
discuss a few examples.
A good certication system should be developed with expert feedback. In addition, it should be transparent, measurable, relevant and comparable.
• Expert-based: Was input acquired from experts and professionals in the elds of design, construction,
building operation and sustainability?
• Transparent: Is information readily available to the public about how buildings are rated?
• Measurable: Does the rating system use measurable characteristics to demonstrate the extent of sustainable design incorporated into the building? Does the system use life-cycle analysis to evaluate?
• Relevance: Does the rating system provide a whole building evaluation rather than an evaluation of
an individual design feature?
• Comparable: Is the rating system able to compare building types, location, years, or dierent sustainable design features?

11.3.7 Conclusion
The built environment is the largest manifestation of human life on the planet. Buildings have been essential
for the survival of the human race, protecting us from the elements and forces of nature. However, they also
consume a lot of material, energy and water, and they occupy land that might otherwise be undeveloped
or used for agriculture. There are many ways to reduce that impact by building to a higher standard of
conservation and reuse. There are a number of systems that can help architects, engineers, and planners to
achieve those standards, and they should be selected with a full awareness of their limitations.

11.4 Sustainable Energy Practices: Climate Action Planning62
11.4.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• understand the considerations needed to make a move to a sustainable energy economy
• describe a path to get to a sustainable energy economy
• connect sustainable energy policies to climate action planning
11.4.2 Introduction
Traditionally, the United States has relied on fossil fuels with minimal use of alternatives to provide power.
The resources appeared to be unlimited and they were found within our borders. As our population has grown
and our reliance on power increased, our resources are decreasing. As discussed in Module Environmental
Challenges in Energy, Carbon Dioxide, Air and Water (Section 8.2), this is particularly true of petroleum
oil, which primarily powers transportation. Our electrical grid and transportation infrastructure of roads
and highways support these fossil fuel dependent technologies. Fossil fuels store energy well, are available
upon demand (not weather dependent), and are inexpensive. However, as we saw in Module Environmental
Challenges in Energy, Carbon Dioxide, Air and Water (Section 8.2) there are many environmental, social,
and even economic impacts of using these nonrenewable fuel sources that are not accounted for in the
traditional methods of cost accounting. Further, the oil industry has been provided with many subsidies or
tax incentives not available to other energy industries.
How do we move to a more sustainable energy economy? We need to pay more attention to the environment, humans, biodiversity, and respecting our ecosystems. It means nding ways to share our resources
equitably both now and in the future so all people can have an equal opportunity to derive benets from
electricity, motorized transportation systems, industry, and conditioned indoor environments. At the same
time, we must preserve human health and protect the natural world.
Energy use is one big piece of the sustainability puzzle, but it is not the only one. Changing the way we
use energy is not easy because of infrastructure, the vision of the American Dream (own a house with a big
yard, a big car, independence), changing government policy, lack of economic incentives, etc. Goals need to
be set, plans made, and policy set to change the way we use energy. This chapter will discuss some of the
commonly held views of where we can start and how we can change.
11.4.3 Climate Action Planning as a Model
Since one of the major sustainability issues is that of climate change and the major cause of climate change
is energy use, climate action planning is a valuable framework for examining sustainable energy practices.
Greenhouse gas emissions result primarily from our building and transportation energy uses, and they are
a measure of the amount of fossil fuels used to provide that energy. They do not directly represent other
environmental emissions, although they mostly parallel other air pollutants. Greenhouse gas emissions do
not express other ecosystem eects such as land use and water, but this planning allows for economical
solutions. A climate action plan provides a roadmap for achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets within
a specic timeline and uses a number of strategies.
11.4.3.1 Who is Doing Climate Action Planning?
In absence of federal regulation, cities, states, government institutions, and colleges and universities, have
all taken climate action initiatives. In Massachusetts63 entities that generate more than 5,000 metric tons
per year of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e) began in 2010 with 2009 emissions. The U.S. Environmental

552 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
Protection Agency (EPA)64 requires facilities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year to
start reporting in 2011 for 2010. Many cities have developed Climate Action Plans that set greenhouse gas
reduction goals and lay out pathways to achieve them. Chicago launched its plan65 in 2008 and reports
annually on its progress. President Obama signed White House Executive Order 1351466 , in October
2009 requiring all federal agencies to appoint a sustainability director, take inventory of greenhouse gas
emissions, and work to meet sustainability targets. Over 670 American colleges and universities have signed
the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC)67 that requires them to
develop climate action plans. Private industries also develop climate action plans.
The National Wildlife Federation68 suggests that there are six steps to reduce carbon emissions at universities  this could be similar for any other entity:
1. Commitment to emissions reduction
2. Institutional structures and support
3. Emissions inventory
4. Developing the plan
5. Launching the plan
6. Climate action planning over the long haul
Based on the climate change scenarios calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change69
,
it is recommended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below the 1990 levels, whether or not
there is continued growth. This is an absolute reduction to prevent greenhouse gases from reaching levels
that will have severe eects. A climate action plan is made of a number of strategies to achieve that goal.
To examine the impact of each strategy the wedge approach is used. Developed by two professors at
Princeton, Socolow and Pacala, the approach proposes that in order to reach those levels, emissions must be
decreased globally by seven gigatons of carbon (not carbon dioxide) compared to "business as usual" (BAU)
scenarios which would increase emissions over time due to growth and increased demand for energy (Figure
The Wedge Approach (a) (Figure 11.16()). These professors identied 15 proposed actions that could each
reduce emissions by 1 gigaton, and if we could enact seven of them we would achieve the goal (Figure The
Wedge Approach (b) (Figure 11.16()). Each of those technologies is represented by a "wedge" of the triangle,
hence the designation of the "wedge approach."

carbon emissions and the lower gure (b) represents the eects of many dierent strategies used to reduce

11.4.4 Sustainable Solutions
All of the proposed solutions in Sokolov and Pacala's proposal are existing technologies. However, for a
solution to be sustainable it must be economically viable. Another aspect of developing a plan is the cost
of the solutions. Figure Global GHG Abatement Cost Curve Beyond Business-As-Usual  2030 (p. 553)
shows the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be abated beyond "business as usual" in 2030, along
with the costs of dierent abatement strategies. Those technologies that fall below the 0 line will actually
have a negative cost or positive economic benet. Those technologies that rise above the 0 line will have
positive cost associated with them which could be oset by the technologies that fall below the line.

Gas Abatement Cost Curve, 200971
The types of technologies that fall below the line are primarily energy conservation and eciency technologies. Energy conservation is the act of reducing energy use to avoid waste, save money, and reduce
the environmental impact. In the framework of sustainable energy planning it allows the more expensive
alternatives, such as renewables, to become more advanced and cost-eective, while we conserve as much as
possible. Conservation has a behavioral aspect to it, such as turning o lights when not needed, lowering
thermostats in the winter, or keeping the proper air pressure in a vehicle's tires. There is a very low cost
to conservation but it entails behavioral change. There are technologies such as motion detectors that can
control lights or programmable thermostats that adjust temperature that can help overcome the behavioral
barrier. Energy eciency72 can be seen as a subset of conservation as it is really about using technological
advancements to make more ecient energy-consuming equipment.
In the United States we use twice as much energy per dollar of GDP as most other industrialized nations
(see Figure Energy Demand and GDP Per Capita (1980-2004) (p. 554)). There are many reasons for
this. One reason is that we use less ecient vehicles and use proportionally more energy to heat and cool
buildings, behaviors that could be modied to be more ecient.

Another reason that the United States uses so much more energy than other industrialized countries
has to do with heating, cooling, and illuminating buildings. Buildings account for about 40 percent of
total energy consumption in the United States (costing $350 billion per year) and greenhouse gas emissions
(see Figure U.S. Energy Consumption by Source (Figure 11.19)). Energy use in buildings is primarily for
heating, cooling, and illumination, with signicant dierences between commercial and residential buildings.
The rest of the energy use is for equipment such as oce equipment, electronics, refrigeration, cooking, and
washing. There are many ways to save energy in existing buildings and most of them have a good nancial
benet of saving money on the energy costs, i.e. they have a short term nancial payback, or return on
investment (ROI).
11.4.4.1 Start with the Lights
The most prevalent message in energy eciency is "change the light bulbs." Replacing traditional incandescent light bulbs with compact uorescent light bulbs can save energy. The light bulb had not evolved much
since Thomas Edison perfected it in 1879. Over the last few years there have been major initiatives across
the United States to replace inecient incandescent light bulbs with compact uorescent light bulbs (CFLs)
that can reduce energy use by 75 percent. The light bulbs also last 10 times as long, reducing waste and
maintenance costs. In commercial buildings more ecient uorescent light bulbs (T-8s) and ballasts75 are
replacing the older T-12s. In 2002, the U.S. Department of Energy required that T-12 ballasts no longer be
manufactured, ending a ve year phase out of this technology.

Already newer, more ecient technologies are hitting the market  light-emitting diodes (LEDs)77 
which use less than 25 percent of the energy of an incandescent light and last at least 15 times longer, if it
has the ENERGY STAR rating. ENERGY STAR78 is the government-backed symbol for energy eciency
recognition. LEDs are small light sources that become illuminated by the movement of electrons through a
semiconductor material (Figure Solid State Lighting (SSL) (Figure 11.21)). The technology is still evolving
and not all LED lights are created equally. LEDs are more expensive and will have a longer pay back time,
but they also last longer.

If CFLs were used in all homes, the most advanced linear uorescent lights in oce buildings, commercial
outlets and factories, and LEDs in trac lights would reduce the percentage of electricity used for lighting
in the world from 19 percent to sever percent. That's equivalent to 705 coal-red power plants.
11.4.4.2 Buy More Ecient Equipment and Appliances
ENERGY STAR also ranks equipment for eciency from refrigerators to air conditioners to computers and
televisions. Policies and nancial incentives encourage people to buy more energy ecient products which
tend to be more expensive. However, by saving on energy costs consumers can recuperate the investment.
Refrigeration makes up 9 percent of household energy use. Refrigerators have gotten more ecient from
3.84 cubic feet per kilowatt hour per day in 1972 to 11.22 cubic feet per kilowatt hour by 1996 (Figure
Average Eciency of New Refrigerators in the United States (1972-1997) (Figure 11.22)). The eciency
of an average new refrigerator has increased dramatically. New technology, increasing price of electricity,
and anticipated energy eciency standards contributed to increased eciency in new refrigerators. The
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 198780 set minimum eciency standards for 13 product

types, including refrigerators. After 1993, no refrigerator could be sold that did not meet the standards.
Standards were updated again in 2002. However, 3 percent more households had two or more refrigerators
in 2001 compared to 1980, partially reducing the eect of increased eciency, especially since the second
refrigerator tends to be less ecient.
Today, consideration should be given to electronics in purchasing. Laptops, for instance use considerably
less electricity than desktops and at screens less than the old cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors. New HD
televisions use more energy than older analog TVs. Also, there are many appliances that even if turned
o, draw power from the grid. This is sometimes called phantom load or vampire power. Although
it is a small amount, it can comprise up to 10 percent of home electricity use. Chargers for cell phones,
digital cameras, computers, and power tools are very common sources of phantom load. Also, TVs, computer
monitors, and DVD players have current whenever they are plugged in. Using a "smart" power strip can
eliminate the need to manually up-plug. Plugging everything in to a strip that is control by one master
device or activated by a motion detector provides the technology to replace the behavior of manually turning
o and unplugging all the devices when they are not in use.

11.4.4.3 Tighten Up the Building Envelope
The building envelope (e.g. walls, windows, foundations, doors, and roofs) greatly aects how ecient a
building will be in maintaining comfortable interior temperatures. Insulation in walls and seals around
windows and doors are prime factors. Low-emittance coatings (microscopically thin, virtually invisible,
metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the

U-factor by suppressing radioactive heat ow), gas-lls, and insulating spacers and frames can signicantly
reduce winter heat loss and summer heat gain through windows.
Double-pane, insulated glass windows signicantly reduce the load on the heating and cooling systems
and drafts, which in turn, reduces energy demand. These projects are most nancially benecial when
leveraged as part of other renovation projects. Existing windows can also be "xed" with weather-stripping
and caulking to seal them from air leakages. Good storm windows over single-pane glass windows can
also provide similar insulation to double-pane without the need for the larger nancial investment and the
creation of waste that replacement entails.
Insulation in the attic or roof of a building and at the "seam" of the building between the basement and
rst oor, as well as the walls can be installed or increased to retain the heated or cooled air for building or
home. Related to insulation is sealing of opening to prevent air from leaking out (see Figure Diagram of a
Leaky Home (Figure 11.23)).
Figure 11.23: Diagram of a Leaky Home Diagram shows the various points in a home where
energy may leak. Source: ENERGY STAR82
11.4.4.4 Maintain or Upgrade Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning Systems
Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems in commercial and industrial buildings need to be properly monitored and maintained for the most ecient function. This is often not done well after a system

is installed because not enough resources are dedicated to maintenance of systems. Processes related to
building commissioning make sure that buildings are ready for service after equipment installation and testing, problems are identied and corrected, and the maintenance sta is extensively trained. If this was not
done or the eect has worn out, buildings may undergo recommissioning83 , or if it was never commissioned,
retrocommissioning84 can be performed.
If equipment such as motors, fans, boilers, and chillers are too old to x or inecient, they can be
replaced or retrotted with more energy ecient equipment. Building automation systems (BAS) use
electronic technology to control and monitor building systems. They can schedule temperature settings and
ventilation needs based on actual or scheduled occupancy so energy can be saved when space is unoccupied.
In homes, this is typically done with a programmable thermostat that can set the temperature points to
conserve energy during the day when a home is unoccupied and then go back to occupancy settings when
the family returns.
Energy consulting companies can provide many services and innovative solutions for building owners that
will reduce energy costs. This is a growing job sector within the United States economy as businesses try to
capitalize on the savings that energy projects like those described above can provide.
11.4.4.5 Combining Heat and Power
One area of huge potential for energy eciency is from capturing waste heat from electricity generation and
many industries through a process called cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP), which is discussed
in greater detail in the Module Combined Heat and Power (Section 8.5.2). Cogeneration is the simultaneous
production of heat and electrical power in a single thermodynamic process. Instead of discarding the heat
produced by the electrical power production or industrial process, it is captured and used to provide space
heating and hot water heating, humidication, cooling (via absorption chillers), as well as other uses, thus
eliminating the added expense of burning fuels for the sole purpose of space heating (see Figure Comparison
of Energy Eciency of Standard Power Plant and Combined Heat and Power Plant (Figure 11.24)). The
U.S. Department of Energy calculated that CHP generation from industrial processes alone is equal to the
output of 40 percent of coal-red generating plants that produced electricity in 2007.

11.4.5 Design New Buildings to Reduce Energy Use
The construction of new buildings consumes a lot of energy from the production of the raw materials, the
transportation to the building site, the construction process, and ultimately the energy used to operate
the building. In the last decade in the United States, there has been a growing recognition that much
could be done to reduce the environmental impact of new construction. Therefore, building energy codes
increasingly demand higher energy eciency and green building certication and recognition systems have
been developed, such as Green Globes86 and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)87
,
to promote design for the environment. Aspects of construction that can enhance energy eciency include
site selection, energy and water eciency, materials used, proximity to public transit and provision of biking
amenities, and renewable energy. In addition, using a process of integrated design where the structure of
the building itself provides the energy needed to heat, cool or illuminate the building, energy savings can be
achieved more readily.

11.4.6 Implementing Renewable Energy Technologies
When buildings have been retrotted to be more energy ecient and combined heat and power systems
are used more broadly, we will have reduced energy demand signicantly and cost eectively, while creating
more jobs domestically. We can then look at the mass deployment of renewable energy technologies. Over
time these technologies will mature and become more aordable. This process can be enhanced through
policy implementation that incentivizes renewable energy development.
The electric grid will need to be expanded. This will allow for more interstate transmission of renewable
electricity from the areas where the resources are good such as the southwest, for solar, and the central and
plains states, for wind, to the areas where the population centers are such as the east and west coasts. If
these grids are smart and allow for real-time energy pricing then demand will be leveled out. This unied
national smart grid would include more ecient, higher-voltage long-distance transmission lines; "smart"
distribution networks that use the internet to connect smart meters in homes and along the grid; energy
storage units (i.e. batteries) throughout the network; and two-way communication between the equipment
that consumes electricity and the equipment that produces it.

564 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
We can envision a future where most cars on the road are electric. At night, consumption across the grid
is lower because lights are o, buildings are closed, and less manufacturing occurs. Owners of electric cars
will plug their cars into the grid at night and recharge them after being driven during the day. Since, demand
for electricity is lower, prices for this utility will be lower. With smart meters, residents will be charged for
the actual cost of electricity at time of use rather than an average price. They will be incentivized to set
washing machines and dishwashers to run at night when electricity demand is lowest. All of this evens out
the demand on the grid, which means that power plants do not need to operate at peak capacity and reduces
the need for new plants.
11.4.7 Energy Savings in Transportation
Transportation comprises nearly a third of energy demand in the United States so energy savings achieved
here will translate to overall energy savings.To reduce energy consumption by vehicles we need to encourage
vehicle eciency and conservation. This is accomplished through the Corporate Average Fuel Economy
(CAFÉ)89 standards. Congress rst enacted these standards in 1975 due to the rising cost of gas that
resulted from the country's dependence on increasing levels of petroleum imports. The National Highway
Trac Safety Administration90 sets fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks sold in the United States
while the EPA calculates the average fuel economy for each manufacturer. In addition to CAFÉ standards,
in 1975 the speed limit on United States highways was reduced to 55 mph to limit gas consumption. Figure
Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Fuel Economy by Model Year (Figure 11.26) shows that model year 2009 had
the lowest CO2 emission rate (397 g/mi) and highest fuel economy (22.4 mpg) since tracking began in 1975.
Figure 11.26: Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Fuel Economy by Model Year Two graphs show
carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy by model year from 1975-2010. Source: U.S. EPA, Light-Duty
Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 through 2010 (Nov.
2010), p. iv91
Other ways to increase eciency can be found through innovative alternative vehicle technologies,
improved internal combustion engines, exhaust gas recycling, variable valve timing, vehicle downsizing,
lightweighting, and behavior. Government policies need to make the cost of driving evident through full
amortization, fuel/road tax, and insurance costs.

565
Another tactic to reduce fuel consumption is increasing the use of transportation alternatives. The
use of active transportation will cause a change from environmentally harmful, passive travel to clean,
active travel by bicycle, foot, and public transit. Convenient and safe public transit is not available in
all communities, as it requires a certain population density to be viable. Moreover, since Americans often
associate the car they drive with their material success and our communities are spread out, many people
do not view public transportation favorably. Most metropolitan areas have some kind of transit system to
provide transportation to those who cannot aord cars or cannot drive and/or to relieve trac congestion.
Historically, the United States has not invested equally in road and public transportation infrastructure
meaning that often it is slower and more complicated to travel by transit. However, transit use is generally
more economical than owning and driving a car. The American Public Transportation Association92 has
calculated the savings based on a two person-two car household going to one-car. They found that riding
public transportation saves individuals, on average $9,656 annually, and up to $805 per month based on the
January 5, 2011 average national gas price ($3.08 per gallon-reported by AAA) and the national unreserved
monthly parking rate. Savings for specic cities are shown here93
.
Bicycling and walking are two forms of alternate transit that have no environmental impact on energy
demand. Many local governments are devoting resources to adding bike routes and parking facilities to
encourage bicycling as a mode of transportation. Sidewalks and safe cross-walks are prerequisites for safe
walking.
There are some options for those who must drive to reduce their energy use. Carpooling and car
sharing are also options that lower the number of cars on the road, while providing opportunities to travel
by car when needed. Improved social network-based car-pooling programs can help to match riders with
drivers in a dynamic way. Car sharing is a decentralized, hourly car rental system that allows people who
do not own cars, but occasionally need one, to access a vehicle in proximity to their workplace or home.
11.4.8 Summary
There is no one silver bullet when it comes to solving the "energy problem" or planning for climate action.
There are many viable solutions and the problem is so large that multiple pathways must be forged. The
primary challenge is to use energy more eciently so little goes to waste. From small actions like changing a
light bulb, to large projects like CHP, the potential is great and the nancial payback rewarding. Increased
vehicle eciency and active transportation are also strategies for reducing energy use. Both within the
building sector and the transportation sector we have the greatest challenges to and potential for changing
how we use energy today. We have already started to make that transition from more stringent CAFÉ
standards to more green buildings. The challenge is to upscale all the strategies to make a signicant
impact.

11.5 Sustainable Transportation: Accessibility, Mobility, and Derived Demand97
11.5.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• explain why the automobile-based system of transportation is unsustainable in terms of inputs, outputs,
and social impacts
• explain why transportation is a derived demand and how making transportation sustainable depends
on land use as well as vehicles and infrastructure
• dierentiate between accessibility and mobility by comparing how they are currently treated by our
transportation system
• analyze how a more sustainable system might address accessibility and mobility
11.5.2 What is Sustainable Transportation?
Transportation is a tricky thing to analyze in the context of sustainability. It consists in part of the built
environment: the physical infrastructure of roads, runways, airports, bridges, and rail lines that makes it
possible for us to get around. It also consists in part of individual choices: what mode we use to get around
(car, bus, bike, plane, etc.), what time of day we travel, how many people we travel with, etc. Finally, it also
is made up of institutions: federal and state agencies, oil companies, automobile manufacturers, and transit
authorities, all of whom have their own goals and their own ways of shaping the choices we make.
Most importantly, transportation is complicated because it's what is called a derived demand. With
the exception of joyriding or taking a walk or bicycle ride for exercise, very rarely are we traveling just for the
sake of moving. We're almost always going from Point A to Point B. What those points arehome, work,
school, shoppingand where they're locateddowntown, in a shopping mall, near a freeway exitinuence
how fast we need to travel, how much we can spend, what mode we're likely to take, etc. The demand for
transportation is derived from other, non-transportation activities. So in order to understand transportation
sustainability, we have to understand the spatial relationship between where we are, where we want to go,
and the infrastructure and vehicles that can help get us there.

Is our current transportation system in the U.S. sustainable? In other words, can we keep doing what
we're doing indenitely? The answer is clearly no, according to professional planners and academics alike.
There are three main limitations: energy input, emissions, and social impacts (Black, 2010 (p. 575)).
11.5.2.1 Energy Inputs
The rst reason that our current transportation system is unsustainable is that the natural resources that
power it are nite. The theory of peak oil developed by geologist M. King Hubbert suggests that because the
amount of oil in the ground is limited, at some point in time there will be a maximum amount of oil being
produced (Deeyes, 2002 (p. 575)). After we reach that peak, there will still be oil to drill, but the cost will
gradually rise as it becomes a more and more valuable commodity. The most reliable estimates of the date
of peak oil range from 2005 to 2015, meaning that we've probably already passed the point of no return.
New technologies do make it possible to increase the amount of oil we can extract, and new reserves, such as
the oil shale of Pennsylvania and the Rocky Mountains, can supply us for some years to come (leaving aside
the potential for environmental and social damage from fully developing these sites). However, this does not
mean we can indenitely continue to drive gasoline-powered vehicles as much as we currently do.
Scientists are working on the development of alternative fuels such as biofuels or hydrogen, but these
have their own limitations. For example, a signicant amount of land area is required to produce crops for
biofuels; if we converted every single acre of corn grown in the U.S. to ethanol, it would provide 10% of
our transportation energy needs. Furthermore, growing crops for fuel rather than food has already sparked
price increases and protests in less-developed countries around the world (IMF, 2010 (p. 575)). Is it fair to
ask someone living on less then two dollars a day to pay half again as much for their food so we can drive
wherever and whenever we want?
11.5.2.2 Emissions or Outputs
The engine of the typical automobile or truck emits all sorts of noxious outputs. Some of them, including
sulfur dioxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter, are directly harmful to humans; they irritate our
lungs and make it hard for us to breathe. (Plants are damaged in much the same way). These emissions
come from either impure fuel or incomplete burning of fuel within an engine. Other noxious outputs cause
harm indirectly. Nitrous oxides (the stu that makes smog look brown) from exhaust, for example, interact
with oxygen in the presence of sunlight (which is why smog is worse in Los Angeles and Houston), and ozone
also damages our lungs.
Carbon dioxide, another emission that causes harm indirectly, is the most prevalent greenhouse gas
(GHG), and transportation accounts for 23% of the CO2 generated in the U.S. This is more than residential,
commercial, or industrial users, behind only electrical power generation (DOE, 2009 (p. 575)). Of course, as
was explained above, transportation is a derived demand, so to say that transportation itself is generating
carbon emissions is somewhat misleading. The distance between activities, the modes we choose to get
between them, and the amount of stu we consume and where it is manufactured, all contribute to that
derived demand and must be addressed in order to reduce GHG emissions from transportation.
11.5.2.3 Social Impacts
If the denition of sustainability includes meeting the needs of the present population as well as the future,
our current transportation system is a failure. Within most of the U.S., lack of access to a personal automobile
means greatly reduced travel or none at all. For people who are too young, too old, or physically unable to
drive, this means asking others for rides, relying heavily on under-funded public transit systems, or simply
not traveling. Consider, for example, how children in the U.S. travel to and from school. In 1970, about 50%
of school-aged children walked or biked to school, but by 2001, that number had dropped to 15% (Appleyard,
2005 (p. 575)). At the same time that childhood obesity and diabetes are rising, children are getting less
and less exercise, even something as simple as walking to school. Furthermore, parents dropping o their
children at school can increase trac levels by 20 to 25%, not just at the school itself, but also throughout

568 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
the town in question (Appleyard, 2005 (p. 575)). At the other end of the age spectrum, elderly people
may be functionally trapped in their homes if they are unable to drive and lack another means of getting
to shopping, health care, social activities, etc. Finally, Hurricane Katrina made it clear that access to a car
can actually be a matter of life or death: the evacuation of New Orleans worked very well for people with
cars, but hundreds died because they didn't have the ability to drive away.
Another serious social impact of our transportation system is trac accidents. Road accidents and
fatalities are accepted as a part of life, even though 42,000 people die every year on the road in the U.S.
This means that cars are responsible for more deaths than either guns, drugs, or alcohol (Xu et al., 2010
(p. 576)). On the bright side, there has been a steady reduction in road fatalities over the last few decades,
thanks to a combination of more safety features in vehicles and stricter enforcement and penalties for drunk
or distracted drivers. Nevertheless, in many other countries around the world, trac accidents are in the
top ten or even top ve causes of death, leading the World Health Organization to consider trac accidents
a public health problem.
An additional problem with our current unsustainable transportation system is that much of the rest of
the world is trying to emulate it. The U.S. market for cars is saturated, meaning that basically everyone who
can aord or is likely to own a car already has one. This is why automobile manufacturers vie so ercely
with their advertising, because they know they are competing with each other for pieces of a pie that's not
getting any bigger. In other countries such as China and India, though, there are literally billions of people
who do not own cars. Now that smaller, cheaper vehicles like the Tata are entering these markets, rates
of car ownership are rising dramatically. While the same problems with resources, emissions, and social
impacts are starting to occur in the developing world, there are also unique problems. These include a lack
of infrastructure, which leads to monumental trac jams; a need for sharing the road with pedestrians and
animals; and insucient regulation to keep lead and other harmful additives out of gasoline and thus the
air.
11.5.3 What Would Make Transportation Sustainable?
The circular answer to the question is to meet our current transportation needs without preventing future
generations from meeting theirs. We can start by using fewer resources or using the ones we have more
eciently. One way to do this is by increasing the eciency of new vehicles as they are manufactured. Since
1981, automotive engineers have gured out how to increase horsepower in the average American light-duty
vehicle (cars and SUVs) by 60%, but they haven't managed to improve miles per gallon at all (see Figure
World Oil Production - History and Projections (p. 568)). As gas prices continue to rise on the downside of
the oil peak, consumers are already demanding more fuel-ecient cars, and federal legislation is moving in
this direction to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

and forecasts of future production (colors). According to the "peak oil" hypothesis, world oil production
will peak and then decline. Estimates of future production vary widely as there is disagreement about
the magnitude of undiscovered reserves. If most of the extractable oil has been discovered, we may have
already reached peak oil (orange curve). If signicant undiscovered reserves remain, peak oil may not
arrive until 2030 or 2040. Source: Released to public domain by Tom Ruen, via Wikimedia Commons98
However, simply producing more fuel-ecient vehicles is not sucient when we consider the embodied
energy of the car itself. It takes a lot of energy to make a car, especially in the modern "global assembly
line," where parts come from multiple countries for nal assembly, and that energy becomes "embodied" in
the metal, plastic, and electronics of the car. A study in Europe found that unless a car is over 20 years old,
it does not make sense to trade it in for a more ecient one because of this embodied energy (Usón et al.,
2011 (p. 576)). Most Americans trade in their cars after about a third of that time. A related concept is
true for electric cars. In their daily usage, they generate zero carbon emissions, but we should also consider
the source of power used to recharge the vehicle. In most parts of the U.S., this is coal, and therefore the
emissions savings are only about 30% over a traditional vehicle (Marsh, 2011 (p. 575)).
If transportation is a derived demand, another way to meet our current transportation needs is by
changing the demand. There are two related aspects to this. First, there is a clear causal link between having
more transportation infrastructure and more miles traveled on that infrastructure, and greater economic
growth. This is true between regions of the world, between individual countries, and between people and
regions within countries. This causal connection has been used as a reason to nance transportation projects

570 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
in hundreds of dierent contexts, perhaps most recently in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act
that distributed federal funds to states and localities to build infrastructure in the hopes that it would create
jobs. Policymakers, businesspeople, and citizens therefore all assume that we need more transportation to
increase economic growth.
However, it is also true that more transportation does not automatically mean more economic growth:
witness the state of West Virginia, with decades' worth of high-quality road infrastructure bestowed upon
it by its former Senator Robert Byrd, but still at the bottom of economic rankings of states. Furthermore,
at some point a country or region gains no signicant improvements from additional infrastructure; they
have to focus on making better use of what they already have instead. We therefore need to decouple
economic growth from transportation growth (Banister and Berechman, 2001 (p. 575)). We can substitute
telecommunication for travel, work at home, or shop online instead of traveling to a store (although the
goods still have to travel to our homes, this is more ecient than each of us getting in our own cars). We can
produce the goods we use locally instead of shipping them halfway around the world, creating jobs at home
as well as reducing resource use and emissions. All of these options for decoupling are ways to reduce the
demand for transportation without also reducing the benets from the activities that create that demand.
The other way to think about changing the derived demand of transportation is via the concepts of
accessibility and mobility. Mobility is simply the ability to move or to get around. We can think of certain
places as having high accessibility: at a major intersection or freeway exit, a train station, etc. Company
headquarters, shopping malls, smaller businesses alike decide where to locate based on this principle, from
the gas stations next to a freeway exit to the coee shop next to a commuter rail station. At points of high
accessibility, land tends to cost more because it's easier for people to get there and therefore more businesses
or oces want to be there. This also means land uses are usually denser: buildings have more stories, people
park in multi-level garages instead of surface lots, etc.
We can also dene accessibility as our own ability to get to the places we want: where we shop, work,
worship, visit friends or family, see a movie, or take classes. In either case, accessibility is partially based
on what the landscape looks likewidth of the roads, availability of parking, height of buildings, etc.and
partially on the mode of transportation that people have access to. If a person lives on a busy four-lane road
without sidewalks and owns a car, most places are accessible to him. Another person who lives on that same
road and doesn't have a car or can't drive might be literally trapped at home. If her oce is downtown and
she lives near a commuter rail line, she can access her workplace by train. If her oce is at a major freeway
intersection with no or little transit service, she has to drive or be driven.

Wikimedia Commons100
Unfortunately, in the U.S. we have conated accessibility with mobility. To get from work to the doctor's
oce to shopping to home, we might have to make trips of several miles between each location. If those trips
are by bus, we might be waiting for several minutes at each stop or making many transfers to get where
we want to go, assuming all locations are accessible by transit. If those trips are by car, we are using the
vehicle for multiple short trips, which contributes more to air pollution than a single trip of the same length.
Because of our land use regulations, which often segregate residential, retail, oce, and healthcare uses to
completely dierent parts of a city, we have no choice but to be highly mobile if we want to access these
destinations. John Urry has termed this automobility, the social and economic system that has made living
without a car almost impossible in countries like the US and the UK (2004 (p. 576)).
So how could we increase accessibility without increasing mobility? We could make it possible for mixed
uses to exist on the same street or in the same building, rather than clustering all similar land uses in one
place. For example, before a new grocery store opened in the student neighborhood adjacent to the University
of Illinois campus in Champaign, people living there had to either take the bus, drive, or get a friend to drive
them to a more distant grocery store. Residents of Campustown had their accessibility to fresh produce and

other products increase when the new grocery store opened, although their mobility may have actually gone
down. In a larger-scale example, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) was sued in the
1990s for discriminating against minorities by pouring far more resources into commuter rail than into buses.
Commuter rail was used mainly by white suburbanites who already had high levels of accessibility, while the
bus system was the only means of mobility for many African-American and Hispanic city residents, who had
correspondingly less accessibility to jobs, shopping, and personal trips. The courts ruled that the transit
authority was guilty of racial discrimination because they were providing more accessibility for people who
already had it at the expense of those who lacked it. The MTA was ordered to provide more, cleaner buses,
increase service to major job centers, and improve safety and security. More sustainable transportation
means ensuring equitable accessibility  not mobility  for everyone now and in the future.
11.5.4 Making Transportation Sustainable
How do we go about making transportation more sustainable? There are three main approaches: inventing
new technologies, charging people the full costs of travel, and planning better so we increase accessibility
but not mobility.
11.5.4.1 New Technology
This is the hardest category to rely on for a solution, because we simply can't predict what might be invented
in the next ve to fty years that could transform how we travel. The jet engine totally changed air travel,
making larger planes possible and increasing the distance those planes could reach without refueling, leading
to the replacement of train and ship travel over long distances. However, the jet engine has not really
changed since the 1960s. Is there some new technology that could provide more propulsion with fewer inputs
and emissions? It's possible. But at the same time, it would be unreasonable to count on future inventions
magically removing our sustainability problems rather than working with what we already have.
Technology is more than just machines and computers, of course; it also depends on how people use it.
When the automobile was rst invented, it was seen as a vehicle for leisure trips into the country, not a way
to get around every day. As people reshaped the landscape to accommodate cars with wider, paved roads
and large parking lots, more people made use of the car to go to work or shopping, and it became integrated
into daily life. The unintended consequences of technology are therefore another reason to be wary about
relying on new technology to sustain our current system.
11.5.4.2 Charge Full Costs
The economist Anthony Downs has written that trac jams during rush hour are a good thing, because
they indicate that infrastructure is useful and a lot of people are using it (Downs, 1992 (p. 575)). He also
notes that building more lanes on a highway is not a solution to congestion, because people who were staying
away from the road during rush hour (by traveling at dierent times, along dierent routes, or by a dierent
mode) will now start to use the wider road, and it will become just as congested as it was before it was
widened. His point is that the road itself is a resource, and when people are using it for free, they will
overuse it. If instead, variable tolls were charged depending on how crowded the road wasin other words,
how much empty pavement is availablepeople would choose to either pay the toll (which could then be
invested in alternative routes or modes) or stay o the road during congested times. The point is that every
car on the road is taking up space that they aren't paying for and therefore slowing down the other people
around them; charging a small amount for that space is one way of recovering costs.

Trac congestion is an example of what economists call externalities, the costs of an activity that aren't
paid by the person doing the activity. Suburbanites who drive into the city every day don't breathe the
polluted air produced by their cars; urban residents suer that externality. People around the country who
use gasoline derived from oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico didn't experience oil washing up on their beaches
after the BP disaster in 2010. By charging the full cost of travel via taxes on gas or insurance, we could, for
example, pay for children's hospitalization for asthma caused by the cars speeding past their neighborhoods.
Or we could purchase and preserve wetland areas that can absorb the oodwaters that run o of paved
streets and parking lots, keeping people's basements and yards drier. Not only would this help to deal with
some of the externalities that currently exist, but the higher cost of gas would probably lead us to focus on
accessibility rather than mobility, reducing overall demand.

574 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
11.5.4.3 Planning Better for Accessibility
The other way we can produce more sustainable transportation is to plan for accessibility, not mobility.
Many transportation planners say that we've been using the predict and provide model for too long. This
means we assume nothing will change in terms of the way we travel, so we simply predict how much more
trac there is going to be in the future and provide roads accordingly. Instead, we should take a deliberate
and decide approach, bringing in more people into the planning process and oering dierent options besides
more of the same. Some of the decisions we can make to try and change travel patterns include installing
bike lanes instead of more parking, locating retail development next to housing so people can walk for a cup
of coee or a few groceries, or investing in transit instead of highways.

square is mixed use, with buidlings serving both residential and commercial functions. The square is

.
For example, the school district in Champaign, Illinois, is considering closing the existing high school
next to downtown, to which many students walk or take public transit, and replacing it with a much larger
facility on the edge of town, to which everyone would have to drive or be driven. The new site would
require more mobility on the part of nearly everyone, while many students and teachers would see their

accessibility decrease. As gas prices continue to rise, it will cost the school district and parents more and
more to transport students to and from school, and students will be more likely to drive themselves if they
have access to a car and a driver's license. Putting the new school in a more accessible location or expanding
the existing one would keep the school transportation system from becoming less sustainable.
You may have noticed that these proposed changes to increase transportation sustainability aren't really
things that one person can do. We can certainly make individual choices to drive less and walk or bike more,
to buy a more fuel-ecient car, or to use telecommunications instead of transportation. In order to make
signicant changes that can reduce overall energy usage and emissions production, however, the system itself
has to change. This means getting involved in how transportation policy is made, maybe by attending public
meetings or writing to city or state ocials about a specic project. It means contacting your Congressional
representatives to demand that transportation budgets include more money for sustainable transportation
modes and infrastructure. It means advocating for those who are disadvantaged under the current system.
In means remembering that transportation is connected to other activities, and that focusing on how the
demand for transportation is derived is the key to making and keeping it sustainable.
11.5.5 Review Questions
Question 11.5.1
Explain the concept of a derived demand and how it accounts for the connections between transportation and land use planning.
Question 11.5.2
What is the concept of embodied energy? Why does it suggest that switching to electric cars is
not a surere way to make transportation more sustainable?
Question 11.5.3
Give an example in your daily life that could be used to explain the dierence between accessibility
and mobility.

11.6 Sustainable Stormwater Management111
11.6.1 Learning Objectives
After reading this module, students should be able to
• describe how stormwater runo aects water quality in urban watersheds
• explain how stormwater is currently managed in the United States
• analyze some of the conventional and innovative techniques that have been developed to address the
water pollution and ood risks associated with urban stormwater runo
11.6.2 Introduction
This module reviews some of the complex issues of urban stormwater management. It rst examines the
hydrological issues aecting the discharge of stormwater runo to our urban rivers and streams, and then
provides an overview of how urban stormwater is managed under the Clean Water Act. After describing the
conventional approaches to urban stormwater management, the nal section provides an overview of various
"sustainable" strategies, especially the use of "green infrastructure," that can be considered to reduce the
water pollution and ooding risks generated by urban stormwater runo.
11.6.3 The Hydrological Context of Urban Stormwater
Stormwater runo (or overland ow) is the portion of precipitation reaching the ground that does not
inltrate into soils, is not taken up and transpirated by plants, nor is it evaporated into the atmosphere.
It is an especially important component of the hydrological cycle in urban areas, since it can cause both
pollution and ooding risks to nearby waterways and their adjacent communities. It should also be noted
that many of the current models of global climate change predict changes in the hydrological cycle in the
future. They predict many more severe storms likely in parts of the Midwest as a result of the moisture and
energy in the atmosphere increasing over the next century because of increasingly higher concentrations of
greenhouse gases. Higher frequencies of more severe storms are likely to further increase the pollution and
ooding risks posed by stormwater runo, especially in urban areas (USGCRP, 2009 (p. 588)).
Current strategies to manage these risks employ the concept of a watershed  the variations in natural
topography that cause both surface water and surcial ground water to ow downhill towards lower-lying
areas or points of discharge, usually to a stream or river. Watershed boundaries are dened topographically
by mapping variations in land elevations around waterways that create hydrologic divides between adjacent

watersheds and between sub-watersheds. The amount of stormwater that ends up as runo within a watershed not only depends on the intensity and amount of precipitation reaching the ground in the form of rain
or snow, but also on the characteristics of the watershed itself. State and federal environmental protection
agencies have developed a number of sophisticated hydrological simulation models that enable the amount
and characteristics of stormwater runo (in terms of its volume and the pollutant load that would be carried
by the stormwater to rivers and streams within the watershed) to be forecasted. They forecast this based
on historical estimates of the amount of precipitation entering the watershed, the characteristics of a watershed's terrain and soils, the amount and location of impermeable surfaces associated with the development
of the watershed, and the extent and types of ground cover within the watershed's drainage area (NRC 2008,
Appendix D (p. 587)). A change in any of these factors will aect the amount and extent of ooding and
water pollution attributable to the discharge of stormwater runo into a river or stream.
Since the pattern of precipitation varies seasonally the water pollution and ooding risks posed by
stormwater runo also tend to vary seasonally. Generally, larger ood and pollution risks will occur in
the spring, when rapid snowmelt can generate a lot of runo volume (especially if the ground is still frozen),
which can carry pollutants that have accumulated within the snow cover over the winter months to nearby
streams and rivers. There can also be storm-related ood and pollution "spikes" when heavy rain strikes the
ground at a faster rate than it can be inltrated into the soils, or when it is prevented from inltrating into
the soils by roofs, paving, or other impermeable surfaces. This initially high volume of stormwater runo
can carry greater amounts of contaminants  a process often described as the "rst ush" phenomenon.
Usually, the rst half-inch of stormwater will be carrying the highest pollution load, so its capture and
management becomes a priority for water quality protection.
How some of these features, especially the amount of impervious surface associated with dierent densities
of development, aect the generation of urban runo are illustrated in Figure Degrees of Imperviousness
and its Eects on Stormwater Runo (Figure 11.31). Research by the Center for Watershed Protection
has found that stream quality becomes impaired when 10% of the stream's watershed is impervious and that
an urban stream's ecology is severely impacted when more than 25% of its watershed is impervious.

When owing downhill within a watershed, stormwater runo can pick up pollutants from various anthropogenic sources and activities. It can also collect pollutants from the atmospheric deposition of particulates
and air pollutants carried to the earth's surface by precipitation, by windblown dust, or by simply settling
out of the atmosphere. Urban runo can also dissolve or transport chemicals that may be found naturally in
soil or nutrients which may have been deliberately added to lawns. Common urban pollutants can include
such things as pesticides and fertilizers applied to residential lawns, parks and golf courses, enteric microbes
from animal waste, industrial chemicals that may have been accidentally spilled on the ground or improperly
stored, or oils and greases leaking from cars parked in lots or on driveways.
As stormwater runo ows towards lower-lying areas of the watershed, it carries these contaminants

with it and therefore contributes to the pollution of the stream, river or lake into which it is discharging.
Once it reaches a river or stream, the concentrations of pollutants in the receiving waters are naturally
reduced as the contaminants are carried downstream from their sources, largely through dilution but also
by settlement, by uptake by posure to sunlight and oxygen, and by interactions with various chemical
and physical proplants and animals (including bacteria and other microorganisms), through degradation by
excesses occurring within the waterway and its streambed.
11.6.3.1 Regulating Urban Runo
Water pollution risks within watersheds are managed under the federal Clean Water Act113 , which requires
state environmental protection agencies to regulate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waterways and
waterbodies pursuant to federal guidelines (NRC, 2008 (p. 587)). The Clean Water Act employs maximum
concentration standards for common pollutants that can impair the recreational or ecological functions of
a river or stream. One class of polluters regulated under the Clean Water Act consists of those that are
directly discharging pollutants into a waterway from an industry or sewage treatment plant through a pipe,
ditch, outfall or culvert  these are called point sources.
Point sourcesare managed under the Clean Water Act by the requirement that each direct source have
a renewable discharge permit, called a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.
NPDES permits set limits for the various pollutants being discharged by that source based on the ambient
water quality of the waterway and its proposed use (e.g. its use as a public water supply source, or for
shing, or recreational use). The other regulated class of polluters managed under the Clean Water Act
consists of those sources that introduce contaminants into a waterway through overland or subsurface ow
 these are called non-point sources, and include most of the water pollution loads carried by urban
stormwater runo.
Since the 1970s, the principal approach used by state and federal environmental protection agencies to
control water pollution is to try to simply reduce the quantity of pollutants being released into our rivers
and streams (NRC, 2008 (p. 587)). NPDES permits control the direct discharge of contaminants into
our waterways, while non-point sources are managed through Best Management Practices (BMPs) that are
designed to limit the amount of pollutants released into a watershed, where they could later be carried by
stormwater runo or by groundwater ow to a receiving stream or river. Depending on the pollutant of
concern, BMPs could be as simple as requiring pet owners to clean up after their pets or as complex as
requiring that industries using toxic materials design, construct and manage loading and storage areas in
order to keep spilled materials from being transported o-site by stormwater or groundwater ow. BMPs
can even include encouraging some industries to change their production processes in order to reduce the
total amount of toxic materials they use, a pollutant reduction strategy known as pollution prevention
(since the fewer toxics used, the lower the risk that they will inadvertently be released into the environment).
The strategy of simply reducing the amount of pollutants entering the environment is complicated by
the fact that many of the non-point pollutants are not amenable to management through local BMPs. For
example, agricultural activities are expressly exempted from the Clean Water Act, even though stormwater
runo from farms and animal feedlots can carry agricultural chemicals, fertilizers and manure into adjacent
waterways, along with topsoil from freshly-plowed elds. Pollutants could also be introduced into an urban
watershed by the deposition of air pollutants. Airborn particulate matter, for example, can be transported
very long distances by the wind, making most locally administered BMPs (except possibly instituting regular
street-sweeping programs) ineective in reducing the distribution and quantities of these types of urban
stormwater pollutants.
In response to these challenges, the Clean Water Act was amended to require state environmental protection agencies to calculate pollution budgets for the impaired segments of their streams and rivers. The
"impaired segments" were those reaches of a stream or river that did not meet the water quality standards
for their intended uses. Models were used to calculate the "total maximum daily load" (TMDL) of pollutants
entering the waterway through both point and non-point sources that would enable the stream segments

to achieve their highest proposed use. The Clean Water Act's new TMDL program provides a more sophisticated framework for evaluating the impacts of non-point pollution on water quality. However, given
the limitations of trying to put more and better BMPs into place, environmental protection agencies have
begun to refocus some of their attention from reducing the total amount of pollutants being released within
a watershed to also reducing the amount of stormwater runo.
Environmental protection agencies have developed strategies for urban stormwater management that
involve modifying a development site so that more precipitation would be retained on-site rather than
owing o of it into nearby waterways or waterbodies. These stormwater retention strategies initially stressed
traditional engineering solutions, such as installing a stormwater collection system that temporarily stores
the stormwater on-site in order to reduce the rate and amount of stormwater being released to a waterway.
The strategies were later expanded to include various site modications, such as constructing vegetated
buer strips or swales (ditches),in order to encourage more stormwater to inltrate into the ground.
Reducing the volume of urban stormwater leaving a site as runo also oers an additional hydrologic
benet in urban watersheds  reducing ood risks (NRC 2008 (p. 587)). Besides having the potential to
carry pollutants, stormwater runo discharge increases the amount of water entering into a lake, stream or
river, increasing both the water volume and ow velocity of the waterway. A relatively large amount of
stormwater runo entering a waterway over a relatively short time can quickly raise a stream's water levels
beyond its banks, causing ooding that could threaten adjacent development. Stormwater contribution to
a river or stream can also increase the velocity of the stream's ow, causing increased channel and bank
erosion, undercutting or damaging dikes, levees and other water control structures, and scouring the stream
or river bed. Stream edge or streambed erosion can impair water quality by increasing the cloudiness (or
turbidity) of the waterway, which can also damage aquatic and riparian habitats.
Stormwater-induced ood risks are managed by the National Flood Insurance Act114 , where hydrologic
models (adjusted by historical ood events) are used to forecast the potential ooding caused by a 100-year
storm (a storm that has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year). The Act forces nancial
institutions to require homeowners within the designated 100-year oodplains to purchase ood insurance in
order to get a mortgage, with the federal government subsidizing the insurance premiums if the community
adopts a ood management program restricting development from extremely hazardous areas and instituting
building code changes to lessen ood damage.
In assessing ood risks, it is important to realize that managing the volume and rate of urban stormwater
being discharged from developed areas does not aect the total amount of stormwater that is being discharged
to a river or stream within a watershed  they only aect the timing of when a storm's precipitation will be
discharged to the waterway (NRC, 2008 (p. 587)). Both the conventional and the newer, more sustainable,
ways of managing stormwater discussed below seek to delay the time it takes for stormwater runo to reach
a waterway in order to reduce the water levels and ow velocities of the receiving streams after a storm.
Slowing the rate by which stormwater is being contributed to a stream spreads out the peak of the resultant
ood levels over a longer time period, allowing many ood risks to be substantially reduced.
11.6.4 Conventional Stormwater Management
Urban stormwater is traditionally managed by the construction of engineered stormwater facilities, such as
storm sewers and detention basins, as part of the land development process. These engineering processes
are specically designed to modify the natural hydrology of a site. For example, when land is being
developed, the parcel is usually graded for development and stormwater infrastructure is installed to channel
the stormwater from individual lots into a separate stormwater sewer system connected to a detention basin
where it is retained until it can be discharged o-site. Site preparation also includes elevating building sites
so that they are constructed on slightly elevated "pads" to encourage stormwater to ow away from building
foundations and toward the streets. After reaching the street, stormwater is then directed to the stormwater
sewers by curbs and gutters.

581
Conventional stormwater detention facilities were historically built to reduce o-site ood risks, and
were not expressly designed to reduce o-site water pollution risks. Any stormwater detention that was
provided was only temporary, often providing an insucient retention time to allow the natural attenuation
of any pollutants that were carried by the runo into the detention basin  unlike the natural attenuation
processes occurring in a river or riparian wetland (where ambient pollution levels are gradually reduced
through dilution, oxidation, chemically binding to rocks and soils, being gobbled up by microorganisms,
etc.). Stormwater is usually detained on-site after a storm only for a period of hours or, at most, days and
then released to a waterway. Some of the particulate contaminants in the stored runo might settle out if
they are large or heavy enough to do so during that short time, some might inltrate into the soils in the
bottom of the detention basin, and some pollutants might be taken up by grass lining the basin, but many
pollutants still end up being carried into the waterway along with the released stormwater.
Since the 1990s, environmental protection agencies have begun to consider the water pollution impacts
of releases from stormwater detention facilities, after the Clean Water Act was amended to require states
to treat stormwater discharges from detention basins as a type of direct source and to require that NPDES
permits be phased in for discharges from Municipal Separate Stormwater Sewer Systems ("MS4") in cities
and urban areas above certain population thresholds (NRC, 2008 (p. 587)). The NPDES permits issued
under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) MS4 program now require the water pollution
loads from stormwater detention basin discharges to be assessed through the creation and adoption of local
stormwater management plans and that the contaminants carried by the stormwater runo to the basins
for later re-release to a waterway be better managed and reduced through the adoption of local BMPs.
MS4 permit regulations issued by state environmental protection agencies usually involve the issuance of a
"general permit" by the agency, applying to all applicable Municipal Separate Stormwater Sewer Systems
located within the state's designated urban areas.
11.6.4.1 Stormwater Sewer Systems Located within the State's Designated Urban Areas
A dierent set of stormwater management issues arise in older urban areas that are already developed.
Most of the United States' older cities and suburbs, especially those established in the late-19th and early
20th centuries, do not have Municipal Separate Stormwater Sewer Systems. Instead, they have what are
known as combined sewer systems  sewers that carry both the stormwater runo from paved streets
and the wastewater (sewage) from homes, stores and factories. These combined sewers transport the mixed
wastewater and stormwater to municipal sewage treatment plants where the diluted sewage is treated and
then discharged to a waterway under an NPDES permit (NRC, 2008 (p. 587)).
Water quality problems arise when rainstorms deposit more precipitation in the city than can be handled
by the sewage treatment plant. As the diluted wastewater begins to ll up the combined sewer system
at a faster rate than it can be treated, the sewage treatment plant operators are faced with a dicult
choice  they can either allow the diluted sewage to continue to back up in the sewers, eventually ooding
residents' basements (a politically unpopular as well as unhealthy option), or they can allow the diluted
wastewater to bypass the sewage treatment plant and be discharged directly into the waterway, with the
untreated wastewater's pollutant levels usually exceeding the limits set forth in the plant's NPDES permit.
Most treatment plant operators choose the more politically acceptable option of releasing the wastewater
in violation of their NPDES permit, creating water pollution incidents called combined sewer overows
(CSOs).
11.6.4.2 Strategies to Manage CSOs
CSO problems are very dicult and expensive to resolve in older cities. One approach to managing stormwater o-site is to tear up the city's streets, digging up the old combined sewers and replacing them with separate
stormwater and wastewater sewer systems. The high costs of retrotting new separate sewer systems are
often prohibitively expensive, especially in these times of stressed state and local budgets. Moreover, the
extensive trac disruptions involved in replacing most streets would not make this a politically popular
choice.

582 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
A second approach to managing CSO issues o-site in developed areas is to keep the combined sewer
system, but to construct a reservoir system large enough to store the diluted wastewater until it can be treated
by the sewage treatment plant. This is the approach used by both the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin115 and
by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago in its Tunnel and Reservoir Plan116 , or
TARP. Although most of TARP has been built, all of the reservoirs have not yet been completed because of
federal budgetary cutbacks. The tunnels themselves and one reservoir are currently able to temporarily store
the combined sewage and the runo from only the rst 3/8-inch (.95 cm) of rain falling in the Metropolitan
Water Reclamation District's service area. The extremely high expense of installing such a supplementary
sewage and stormwater storage system would make it unaordable to most cities unless very substantial
federal and state grants are provided.
A third way to address CSO issues o-site is to use the streets themselves to temporarily store stormwater
by installing low speed bump-like structures at intersections and by restricting the streets' sewer intakes to
the combined sewer system (US EPA, 2000 (p. 587)). This urban retrot strategy would allow stormwater
to ow from lots into the streets, which would ood up to their gutter tops during heavy storms, functioning
as stormwater reservoirs. The stored stormwater would then slowly be discharged to the combined sewers
through the restricted grates over a period of hours after the storm, reducing the amount of diluted sewage
ow to a quantity that could be adequately treated by sewage treatment plants. The ooding of streets,
impairing automobile access, and the possibility of stormwater overowing the curbs and damaging parked
cars and adjacent property during very heavy rainstorms may not make this a politically popular option,
though.
11.6.5 Managing Urban Stormwater More Sustainably
There is a fourth approach to dealing with CSO problems, which involves intercepting and delaying the discharge of precipitation from a parcel of land before it ows o-site to a separate or combined sewer system,
or to an adjacent waterway. Encouraging on-site storage or inltration reduces the stormwater contribution
to a combined sewer's ow in developed areas, thereby reducing the amount of diluted wastewater being
generated and enabling combined sewer systems to better handle their wastewater loads during rainstorms.
These decentralized on-site approaches to managing stormwater could also be used to reduce the amount of
conventional stormwater infrastructure needed in new developments using separate stormwater sewer systems. Because these on-site approaches are less resource-intensive and more cost-eective than conventional
stormwater management approaches, they are also more sustainable investments.
On-site stormwater management techniques are also often known as "green infrastructure" (Jae et
al., 2010 (p. 587)). Development projects using "green infrastructure" for urban stormwater management
are commonly known as "Low Impact Developments." Low Impact Development projects using green
infrastructure usually allow stormwater to be managed at lower costs than by using conventional detention
practices (US EPA, 2007 (p. 587)).
There are essentially three strategies for on-site stormwater management: (1) techniques that encourage
the inltration of stormwater into soils to reduce its volume before it reaches a sewer system, or which
employ more selective grading and the planting of vegetation to reduce its rate of ow from the site; (2)
techniques that encourage the temporary storage of stormwater on-site, instead of transporting it o-site
for centralized detention within a development project or a municipality; and (3) techniques, such as the
construction of articial wetlands, which also allow some degree of longer-term retention and treatment of
the stormwater by natural processes before it is discharged. Inltration techniques might also provide some
water treatment capabilities due to the longer retention times of groundwater before discharge, but the
degree of such treatment would largely depend on soil characteristics, the amount of overlying vegetation
and the depth of the soil's unsaturated zone.

11.6.6 Increasing Stormwater Inltration
Techniques to decrease the volume of stormwater runo and to reduce the rates at which it is discharged
include the use of permeable paving and the construction of "rain gardens" and vegetated swales (see Figure
Permeable Paving & Vegetated Swales (Figure 11.32)). Permeable paving uses materials which are
specially formulated to have air voids in their matrix, allowing water to ow into and through the paving
materials after they are installed. It also includes the more common installation of precast porous pavers
that are designed with holes through their surfaces, allowing stormwater to ow through their holes into the
soils beneath them. Permeable paving needs to be periodically maintained because its pores can be clogged
by ne grains of topsoil or with other small particles (such as soot from atmospheric deposition) carried
along by the runo. Maintenance includes periodically sweeping or vacuuming the paving to control the
build-up of clogging particles.
Figure 11.32: Permeable Paving & Vegetated Swales Permeable paving drains into a vegetated
swale as part of Elmhurst College's (in Illinois) parking lot's "green" stormwater management system.
Source: Jae, M., et al. (2010) (p. 587), Fig. 14, p. 117.
"Rain gardens" can also be used to encourage stormwater to inltrate into the soils, where it can be
taken up by plants and transpired to the atmosphere, evaporated from the soils, or allowed to inltrate
deeper into the soils to become groundwater. Rain gardens are created in areas of low-lying terrain that
are expressly designed for, or engineered with, well-drained soils and are usually planted with deep-rooted
native vegetation that often can survive the drier soil conditions between rains. Rain gardens can be
quite eective in intercepting and inltrating stormwater being discharged from roofs, with roof downspouts
directing the discharge of stormwater into a rain garden instead of allowing it to ow across the lot and into

584 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
the street sewer system. Some native vegetation, however, may have special maintenance requirements, such
as the periodic burning needed to manage some prairie plants.
Vegetated ditches or swales can also be used to transport stormwater runo to a conventional stormwater
management system, with the vegetation planted in the ditch slowing the rate of stormwater ow while also
allowing a portion of the runo to be inltrated into the soils or taken up by plants. In many cases, vegetated
swales and rain gardens can provide less-expensive alternatives to the installation of separate stormwater
sewer system, since it reduces the need for the construction of street gutters, grates, street catchment basins
and sewer pipes (US EPA, 2007 (p. 587)). Interception of the stormwater by inltration and plant uptake
in a rain garden or vegetated swale may also reduce the amount, capacity and size of the sewers that would
have to be built to manage a predicted volume of stormwater, if these green infrastructure techniques are
used to supplement a conventional stormwater collection system.
11.6.7 Increasing Interim On-site Storage
Sustainable management techniques that can temporarily store stormwater on-site until it can be released
o-site to a sewer system or to conventional stormwater detention facilities include the use of "green roofs"
and rain barrels connected to roof downspouts. Rain barrels allow precipitation to be collected and stored,
and then used for non-potable purposes (lawn irrigation, for instance) allowing the captured stormwater
to substitute for more expensive, treated water (see Figure A Rain Barrel Collection System (Figure 11.33)).
Figure 11.33: A Rain Barrel Collection System This "green" building (Ryerson Woods Welcome
Center, Lake County (Illinois) Forest Preserve District )uses both a rain barrel to collect stormwater
draining from the roof, and a rain garden to help inltrate precipitation. Source: Jae, M., et al. (2010)
(p. 587), Fig. 12, p. 116.
A green roof is a at roof surface that uses amended soil materials installed above a layer of waterproof
roong materials to allow shallow-rooted plants to be planted. While still being an impermeable feature of a

585
development site (because of its waterproof layer), a green roof can temporarily store rainwater before it is
discharged to the ground by the roof gutters and downspouts (see Figure A Green Roof (Figure 11.34)).
Just as a rain barrel can store (and re-use) a portion of the stormwater precipitation being discharged from
impervious roofs, the soils of a green roof can capture and temporarily store stormwater precipitation as the
pores between the soil particles ll up with rainwater. Green roofs can even partially reduce the runo's
pollution load through plant uptake and by other biological and physical processes within the roofs' soil
materials while they are saturated. Because of the need to both water-proof the roof while installing a
biological system on top of it, green roofs tend to cost more than conventional roofs, even ignoring the
additional structural engineering that might be necessary to accommodate the weight of the green roof's soil
and plantings.
Figure 11.34: A Green Roof The green roof on this police station in Village of Villa Park, Illinois
has shallow-rooted plants placed in a thin layer of growing medium installed on top of a waterproof roof
membrane. Source: Jae, M. et al. (2010) (p. 587), Fig. 13, p. 116.
The stormwater management benets of rain barrels and green roofs depend on their storage capacity
relative to the amount of impervious surface area of the roof with which they are associated. Rain barrels
might be able to capture only a fraction of an inch of the stormwater falling on a roof and being discharged
from a downspout, while several inches of amended soils on a rooftop might be able to store substantially
more precipitation before it evaporates, is taken up by the roof's plants, or is discharged from the green
roof via its gutters and downspouts. In both cases, however, the interception and temporary retention of

586 CHAPTER 11. SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
stormwater by these green technologies may allow conventional stormwater management systems to function
more eciently by reducing the amount of stormwater being discharged into the systems. They would also
certainly reduce some of the "peakiness" of stream ooding by being able to temporarily store and then
release stormwater from impermeable roof surfaces later after a storm event.
11.6.8 Treating Urban Stormwater
Some sustainable stormwater management approaches have the potential to actually treat the water to remove pollutants as well as control its volume and rate of discharge. These strategies include constructing
wetlands and planting trees. Wetlands have proven to be very eective in both temporarily storing stormwater runo and reducing ooding risks, while also reducing the pollutant load carried to the wetland (because
of its high biological activity that can capture and degrade the contaminants). As a result, the federal
government has adopted a "no net loss" policy with respect to protecting existing wetlands. Section 404 of
the federal Clean Water Act requires that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (under U.S. EPA oversight)
review any proposals to ll or damage any wetlands that are directly hydrologically associated with navigable
waterways. Any actions aecting existing wetlands will need a Corps 404 permit in addition to any local or
state approvals.
Besides preserving existing wetlands, new wetlands can also be designed, created and maintained as
part of a "green" stormwater management strategy (NRC, 2008 (p. 587)). The constructed wetland can be
designed and used to intercept, temporarily store and treat stormwater runo before it is released to a stream
or river. Water control structures are also usually installed to ensure that the constructed wetlands remain
ooded for long enough periods of time to support wetland vegetation. If appropriate plants are selected,
they can also provide important habitats. Wetland maintenance involves the control of invasive plant species
(e.g. Purple Loosestrife) and the management of any sediment that can be carried by stormwater runo into
the wetland, since the sedimentation of wetlands can ll them in, impairing their ecological and treatment
functions.
The planting of trees is an especially valuable strategy to manage urban stormwater, especially when
the trees become mature. Tree canopies break rain velocity, reducing runo ow rates, while tree roots
can stabilize soils against being eroded by urban runo. Tree canopies reduce temperatures, mitigating
urban heat island eects, by providing shade and through their transpiration processes. Their leaves and
roots can also capture some stormwater contaminants and provide carbon sequestration to reduce climate
change impacts. Moreover, trees provide a valuable soil amendment as their fallen leaves decay into mulch,
improving the inltration rate and biological activity of surrounding soils, while larger broken branches
falling into urban streams can slow stream velocities and provide improved riparian and aquatic habitat.
The shading of streams by riparian trees is particularly important in ensuring that a stream's ecological
functions remain resilient in the face of rising temperatures caused by global climate change.
11.6.9 Conclusions
All of the green infrastructure and Low Impact Development techniques that provide interim on-site stormwater storage to reduce ood risks can also provide some pollution removal capabilities, as well. The American
Society of Civil Engineers and U.S. EPA maintain an International Stormwater BMP Database117 of development projects using green infrastructure. This on-line resource reviews the eectiveness of various
stormwater management practices and makes these sustainable techniques more accessible to local ocials
and municipal public works departments charged with managing stormwater runo in their communities.
There is increasing public interest in using sustainable stormwater management techniques to replace or
supplement conventional stormwater facilities. The U.S. federal government, for example, is now requiring
that green infrastructure be used in all federal projects above a certain size to manage urban stormwater
runo. Local ocials are also showing a greater interest in these sustainable approaches, since they are often
less expensive to install and maintain over their life-spans than conventional stormwater sewer systems and

detention facilities. Finally, state governments are beginning to set aside money in their revolving loan funds
for public infrastructure that is earmarked for green infrastructure projects. It is likely that this interest in
sustainable urban stormwater management will continue to grow.
11.6.10 Review Questions
Question 11.6.1
Which of the sustainable urban stormwater management practices can best be used in existing
neighborhoods, and which are best suited for new development?
Question 11.6.2
The performance of many of the green infrastructure practices often depends on how well they are
maintained over their life-spans. What are some eective strategies that local ocials can consider
in order to ensure that the green infrastructure being used to manage urban stormwater in their
communities is adequately maintained and continues to perform as designed?

The Newells celebrated the rst anniversary of life in the Equinox House in late 2011, so they now possess
more than a year's worth of data about how much electricity they used on day-to-day basis, as well as how
much electricity their solar panels produced.
According to Ty Newell, who is professor emeritus of mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, the Equinox House required about 12,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity to operate from
December 2010 through November 2011. That total includes electricity for heating and air conditioning, hot
water heat, clothes washing and drying, and all other appliances. No natural gas is used in the house.
Newell noted that energy use in the Equinox House for the rst year was approximately 20 percent greater
than it will be in 2012 and subsequent years. That's because he was using the least ecient of three dierent
heating systems that will be tested in the home.
During the rst year, the solar panels that power the Equinox House produced approximately 11,000
kilowatt-hours of electricity. This would have made the Newells purchasers of 1,000 kilowatt-hours, in net
terms, had it not been for the fact that the solar panels were on line for some time before they moved into
the house.

Thanks to the more ecient heating system now in place, the Equinox House will produce surplus
electricity in 2012 and in the future. That's by design. The surplus will be used to power their all-electric
Ford Focus for the 8,000 miles of in-town driving they do annually.
In conjunction with its solar panels, the Equinox House achieves net-zero energy use because it requires
far less energy than even a well-built conventional homeabout one-fth as much. It does so through the
use of design and technology that did not add a signicant burden to the cost of construction.
The walls and roof of the Equinox House are constructed with twelve-inch thick structural insulated
panels, which are four to ve times more eective at preventing thermal transfer than the walls of a typical
house. Great care has also been taken to minimize any leakage of air through envelope of the house.
The Equinox House uses high performance, triple-pane windows, which also help to prevent thermal
transfer. Beyond that, the windows are oriented to allow direct sunlight into living space for the heat it
provides during the cooler half of the yearbeginning on the Fall equinoxand to exclude direct sunlight
during the warmer half of the yearbeginning on the Spring equinoxwhen it would increase the load on
the cooling system.
Ultimately, the demands of the Equinox House for heating, cooling, ventilation, and humidity control
will all be met by a single, heat-pump based system, developed by Ty Newell and his son Ben through their
company, Newell Instruments. Aside from the fact that it maintains a comfortable temperature and level
of humidity in the house, this system also delivers a constant ow of fresh air from the outside, and it does
that without the loss of conditioned air that occurs in a drafty house.
Of course the Equinox House will be outtted in other ways that emphasize conservation, including LED
lighting, low-ow plumbing xtures, etc. It even features a system for collecting rainwater that is designed
to meet 80 percent of the annual water needs for a family of four.
When he talks about the Equinox House, Ty Newell emphasizes how well it works from an economic
perspective, since the couple's average daily cost for energy is a mere $3.00. That's based on a twenty-year
life for the solar array, which cost a net of $20,000 installed.
In addition, Newell enjoys the fact that a signicant part of their up-front expenditure supported job
creation, the labor that went into the manufacture and installation of their solar panels. That's in contrast
to money they might have otherwise spent on fossil fuel.
You might think that the Newells must be sacricing comfort for the sake of energy savings, but that's
not the case. Their house boasts 2,100 square feet of living space and all of the amenities you would expect
in a contemporary suburban residence.
On top of that, they enjoy much better indoor air quality than people who live in conventional homes,
thanks to a constant ow of conditioned fresh air from the outside.

peak oil / Hubbert's peak
A single oil well follows a pattern of
increasing production in initial years as
its plentiful resources are tapped to
declining production in mature years as
its resources are depleted. These two
trends are separated by a peak in
production of the well. M. King Hubbert
extrapolated this pattern from one well
to many and in 1956 predicted that the
United States' oil production would peak
in the mid-1970s. Although widely
criticized at the time, Hubbert's
prediction proved true. This success led
to widespread predictions for the peak of
world oil production. The concept of
peak oil is an inevitable consequence of
using oil faster than it can be made.
However, attempts to predict when the
peak will occur are notoriously dicult.

crude oil, for battery-driven cars this is
the power generation plant were
electricity is produced. Gasoline is then
delivered to the pump and nally to the
car, where it is converted (the point of
